1
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,926
Captain Price.

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,932
Thank you for everything.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,975
What?

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,395
Please tell everyone I said that too.

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,399
Wait…

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,818
Lovely.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,361
Lovely, where are you going?

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
That day,

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,757
everything changed.

10
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,182
My whole life changed.

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,312
I've been ignoring that fact all my life.

12
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,231
So now, I need to see it.

13
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,818
With my own eyes.

14
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,403
UFOs.

15
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,113
Aliens.

16
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,117
I just wish I could witness it once
with my own eyes.

17
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,285
Satisfy my curiosity.

18
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,580
Find out about the chip
that was inside my head.

19
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,167
Why do these things keep happening to me,

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,586
and what do they want from me?

21
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,550
CAP

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,095
Where are you?

23
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,264
Forget it! Tell me where you are!

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,266
I can no longer hesitate.

25
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,602
If it's not now,

26
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,230
there might not be another chance.

27
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,358
A chance to make things right.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,528
A chance to get my life back.

29
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,239
I'm sorry, Bora.

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,216
Security will be tight,
starting at the main entrance.

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,095
I'll come up with a plan to get past it.

32
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,976
There's a separate building for Father
in the inner part of the site.

33
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,520
The gospel will
probably be stored in there.

34
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,565
If we enter quietly
while Father is giving his speech--

35
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,482
Wait.

36
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,192
The gospel?

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
Oh, well--

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,737
Are you talking about the alien chip?

39
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,655
Yes.

40
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,035
Your Holiness.

41
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,705
No matter what happens,

42
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,665
I will make sure to protect you.

43
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:47,667
I'll risk my life.

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,252
I don't think that will help.

45
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,630
They'll kill us immediately
if they catch us.

46
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,132
You and me both.

47
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,593
Your Father, or whatever he is,

48
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,636
he's more than capable of doing that.

49
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,222
Look at how he sent those men earlier.

50
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,559
So stop saying these useless things
and just focus on driving.

51
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,022
I will come up with a plan.

52
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,990
ABANDON YOUR CARBON BODIES
REACH ASCENSION AND UNITY!

MESSIAH'S MEMORIAL SERVICE

54
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,461
Oh gosh!

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,180
Sister Seo. Are you having a hard time?

56
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:43,973
No.

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,310
Not at all, Sister Back!

58
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,313
Do you know
just how merciful this treatment is

59
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,523
compared to what you did?

60
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,402
Yes. Of course, I do. Sister Back.

61
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,029
Then put your back into it.

62
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,323
The world will be ending soon.

63
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,034
-Right.
-Seriously, I can't believe you.

64
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,244
Carry it properly!

65
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,232
What are you doing?

66
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,154
SISTER SEO HWAJUNG
SERIOUSLY, CHANWOO, WHERE ARE YOU?

67
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,163
If you're alive, please contact me…

68
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,249
The preparations for the memorial
are almost done.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,419
Come quickly.
We have to receive salvation together!

70
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,882
I'm so miserable and lonely right now.

71
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,426
On this great day…

72
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
Oh my!

73
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,273
Where are you?

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,174
What the…

75
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,135
Huh?

76
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,473
My phone is out of battery,
so I can't take the call.

77
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,058
I'm sorry, Sister Seo.

78
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,144
Chanwoo, why was your phone off?

79
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,146
Are you okay?

80
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,066
What happened that day
after you left with Her Holiness?

81
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,152
I'm so confused right now!

82
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,655
It's a little difficult
to tell you through text.

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,156
Where are you right now?

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,951
I told you I'm here preparing
for the memorial service.

85
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,579
What are you doing? You need to get here!

86
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,915
What's the location?

87
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,500
I haven't been informed.

88
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,798

BLUELIGHT TRAINING CENTER

89
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,894
"Direct"?

90
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,278
"Register"?

91
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,283
HONG JUNSIK (HONG JIHYO'S FATHER)

92
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,745
Yes, this is Kim Byungjo.

93
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,666
Yes, Mr. Hong. Yes.

94
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,877
Ah, yes.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,254
I've been quite busy lately.

96
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,422
Pardon?

97
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,631
Ms. Hong, again?

98
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,094
Yes. Where did she say
she was going before she left?

99
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,429
Pardon?

100
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,143
She left with whom?

101
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,270
Jiyong?

102
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,188
Yes.

103
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,356
A street cat named Kwon Jiyong.

104
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,485
We left to go look for him.

105
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,654
I see. And?

106
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,158
And, well…

107
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,328
We talked about our past,
and then got into an argument.

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,330
Was it an argument?

109
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,665
Anyway, after that,

110
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,002
she suddenly ran off somewhere
as if something bad happened.

111
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,962
Can I ask what the argument was about?

112
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,507
She asked if I really tried to do it.

113
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,925
Do what?

114
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,426
Commit suicide.

115
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:35,264
She asked if I really moved out,
bought tickets, and flew out to Thailand.

116
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,267
She asked me that out of the blue.

117
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,270
Mr. Lee Siguk came back.

118
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,980
Mr. Lee Siguk…

119
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:43,940
What?

120
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,110
I just met him.

121
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,154
He's been staying at Ms. Hong's house.

122
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,406
What has he been doing this whole time?

123
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,117
Was he really kidnapped by that cult?

124
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,621
Yes. We can't completely rule out
that possibility.

125
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,374
He doesn't remember anything
that has happened to him.

126
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,793
That's crazy.

127
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,586
So, what did you find?

128
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,547
Oh, right.

129
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,135
There's a register here
in the folder named "Direct."

130
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,721
Guess whose names I looked for in here.

131
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,889
Who?

132
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,643
The people who committed mass suicide?
At the nursing home?

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:25,815
Those people were taken off the register
the day after the incident.

134
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,484
But do you know what's really strange?

135
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,485
What?

136
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,738
There was one more person.

137
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,073
What?

138
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,866
This person didn't die,

139
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,369
so why was his name crossed off the list?

140
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,209
Maybe he knew something
that he shouldn't have.

141
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
About the mass suicide.

142
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,756
-Is his phone number on there?
-I just sent it to you.

143
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,216
Okay, I'll head there now.

144
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
Excuse me.

145
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,723
Mr. Lee.

146
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,393
What were you just talking about? A cult?

147
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,561
Kidnapping?

148
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,798
It's taken a long time, hasn't it?

149
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,305
You've worked so hard

150
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,724
to get to this point.

151
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,570
Dad.

152
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,948
-I've brought it.
-Okay.

153
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,327
Put it inside.

154
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,170
Almost everyone has arrived.

155
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,132
And,

156
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,385
the drugs?

157
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,638
We are handing them out as they enter.

158
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,101
It'll work, right?

159
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,897
Once taken,
it'll all be over in three minutes.

160
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,691
There will be no pain.

161
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,443
All right.

162
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,538
Um, Dad.

163
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,873
What?

164
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,211
Well…

165
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,964
Uh, well…

166
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,177
Is it because of Her Holiness?

167
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,725
I would like to suggest
postponing the main ceremony.

168
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,728
Her body was supposed
to be revealed today.

169
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:12,481
I know she left behind the gospel,

170
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,067
but everyone seemed highly expectant.

171
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,530
The congregation probably
will want to see proof of her martyrdom--

172
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,614
"Proof."

173
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,284
So there needs to be proof?

174
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,746
If not,

175
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,207
it'll be obvious
we've been swindling them all along.

176
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,208
No.

177
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,960
Swindling? No, I mean--

178
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,670
-Brother Oh.
-Yes.

179
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,675
Are you afraid of the congregation?

180
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,635
Pardon?

181
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,554
I'm

182
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,599
afraid of them.

183
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,771
The Messiah we've
all been waiting so long for

184
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,274
could not accept

185
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,028
her calling and ran away.

186
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
If I think about how long they've waited,

187
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,913
I can't bring myself to tell them that.

188
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,289
I can't tell them…

189
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,960
because I am afraid.

190
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
Yes, Dad.

191
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,882
Please go in.

192
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,259
Please move quickly.

193
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,678
Please hurry in, Brothers and Sisters.

194
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,680
Father's speech will start soon.

195
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,349
Please do it here.

196
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,684
The Father's speech will start soon.

197
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
You can go in.

198
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,021
Please head to the outdoor yard.

199
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,274
-Please walk in a line.
-Please hurry!

200
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,526
This is the drug.

201
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,780
For quick entry,
please prepare the QR code in advance!

202
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,449
Please hurry in, everyone.

203
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,034
Father's speech will start soon.

204
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,452
Please hurry.

205
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,288
Please come in quickly.
We're closing the entrance soon.

206
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,001
Please make sure
to keep the necklace with you.

207
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,212
We will close the entrance soon.

208
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,672
They've already started.

209
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,673
What?

210
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,092
Hey.

211
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,718
Dammit!

212
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,057
What is that?
What are you going to do with that?

213
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,518
We have no time, Your Holiness.

214
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,854
Once the speech ends,

215
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,106
Holy Father is going to call Father Light.

216
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,692
We have to get in right now.

217
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,443
You mean, past all those people?

218
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,947
I'm not afraid, Your Holiness.

219
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,616
Hey, you'll get yourself killed!

220
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,326
You'll give me salvation anyway.

221
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,454
On that glorious day,

222
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,916
the Messiah will overcome
the trial of death.

223
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,960
The Messiah said to the sheep,

224
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,462
"The body is merely
a prison with bars of carbon."

225
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,131
"Follow me towards the Light."

226
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,803
Father Light's messenger will wear
the flesh of man and come down among us…

227
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,890
FROM FLESH TO LIGHT!
THE MESSIAH'S MEMORIAL SERVICE

228
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,604
…and everyone will see the Light,
even those without faith.

229
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,731
-Wait!
-He will come down…

230
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,732
Wait.

231
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,528
You believe in me, right?

232
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,155
Yes, Your Holiness.

233
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,448
Of course.

234
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,490
Then,

235
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,493
do they believe in me too?

236
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,580
Sorry?

237
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,917
Do those people believe in me like you do?

238
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,211
What do you…

239
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,011
Let us lift up

240
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:33,349
The cross together

241
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,394
Come to us

242
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:43,067
The Light of life

243
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,823
Sella

244
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,036
-Messiah!
-Messiah!

245
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,543
Sella!

246
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
-Dad!
-Dad!

247
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,630
-Dad!
-Dad!

248
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,757
-Dad!
-Dad!

249
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,221
-We love you, Sella!
-Dad!

250
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,307
Dad, we love you! Sella!

251
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,112
Today is the day.

252
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,406
Brothers and Sisters.

253
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,866
How long…

254
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,703
For how long have we waited?

255
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,332
I know…

256
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,422
what sacrifices you all have made
for this very day.

257
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,634
Some of you abandoned
your jobs for this day.

258
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,929
Some of you abandoned your family.

259
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,639
Some of you abandoned honor.

260
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,767
Some couldn't wait for this day to come

261
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,562
and even abandoned their own lives!

262
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
However, everyone,

263
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,817
today

264
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,403
has finally come!

265
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,868
Although she has left our side,

266
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,829
the Messiah, Her Holiness,

267
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,290
left us

268
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,879
with the last key to paradise.

269
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,593
Hurry. Entry is over.
We're closing the gate.

270
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,677
Quickly!

271
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,018
To this moment,

272
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,439
I still clearly remember
how Her Holiness looked.

273
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,486
In order to bring us
the truth of ascension and salvation,

274
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,490
she suffered

275
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,867
until her very last breath!

276
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,122
-She endured trials and pain of the flesh.
-Check it quickly.

277
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,248
Look down.

278
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,000
However,

279
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,294
her body

280
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,714
was not able to endure the heavy burden…

281
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,677
Lord!

282
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,763
It's the Messiah!

283
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,063
-What?
-How can this be?

284
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,026
Wait, what…

285
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,820
What's happening?

286
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,679
Captain Price?

287
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,681
Captain Price!

288
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,893
Oh, hey.

289
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,646
What the heck is going on right now?

290
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,399
What are you gonna do about the café?
It's totally wrecked.

291
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,067
I don't know either, kid.

292
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,861
What about Moonhole?

293
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,112
You said she was here.

294
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,074
What?

295
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,993
Where did she go?

296
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,917
Sister Abigail!

297
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,045
Is she…

298
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,174
It's true.

299
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,051
She is the Messiah.

300
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,139
No, but how…

301
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,100
We were told she had passed away.

302
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,857
The truth is…

303
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,530
I was resurrected.

304
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,411
What?

305
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,126
Dammit.

306
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,296
I…

307
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,465
have been resurrected!

308
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,936
On that

309
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,690
glorious day, the Messiah will come

310
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,027
overcoming the trial of death!

311
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,241
Those with eyes shall see!

312
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:49,373
They shall lift their eyes and see!

313
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,262
The Messiah

314
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,974
has risen!

315
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,433
It's the Messiah!

316
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,477
-Messiah!
-Messiah!

317
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,606
Messiah!

318
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,358
Messiah!

319
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,568
Messiah!

320
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,828
We need to talk!

321
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,496
Silence!

322
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,625
Forgive me.

323
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,795
What did you say?

324
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,380
We need to talk.

325
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,549
All right.

326
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,511
Let us go inside, somewhere quiet.

327
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,055
Not somewhere quiet.

328
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,557
Right here.

329
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,476
In front of everyone.

330
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,564
Because I…

331
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,900
I have nothing to hide

332
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,570
from my believers.

333
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,031
Wow, Messiah!

334
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,066
-Wait, excuse me.
-Yes.

335
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,317
Q, QR…

336
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,736
Sister!

337
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:46,490
The memorial service has been canceled!

338
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,407
What?

339
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,659
Her Holiness has risen from the dead.

340
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,995
-She has been resurrected!
-Resurrected!

341
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,288
Wait.

342
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,332
Wait, who did what?

343
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,584
Her Holiness has risen.

344
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,170
She has come back to bring us salvation.

345
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,254
Light be with you.

346
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,178
What's with those people?

347
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,055
Why do they always disappear somewhere?

348
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,973
What is she going to do all by herself?

349
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,768
-What are you doing?
-Quiet!

350
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,255
Is your head okay?

351
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,714
Younggi.

352
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,176
My daughter.

353
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,345
Where is she?

354
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,602
Uh, well…

355
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,897
Why did you bring him?

356
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,315
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MENTAL DISORDERS

357
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,234
What was I supposed to do?

358
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,737
He was asking to come,
looking at me like he was a lost puppy.

359
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,408
Is it okay to let a civilian
investigate with us like this?

360
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,702
Hey, it's fine. It doesn't matter.

361
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,328
And you're a civilian too.

362
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,386
-Mr. Kim Byungjo, please come in.
-Okay.

363
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,854
Which one of you is Mr. Kim Byungjo?

364
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,898
I'm Sergeant Kim Byungjo
from Geoan Station.

365
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,027
Doctor.

366
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,446
You used to attend
the Divine Light Church, right?

367
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,283
This punk,

368
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,993
did he cause trouble again?

369
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,080
Everyone, the Messiah's memorial service
has been canceled.

370
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,876
In a moment, Holy Father
will have an audience with the Messiah.

371
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,086
Please gather in the assembly hall.

372
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,964
I repeat.

373
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,342
The Messiah's memorial service
has been canceled.

374
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,554
In a moment, Holy Father
will have an audience with the Messiah.

375
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,389
Please gather in the assembly hall.

376
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,307
Lord!

377
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,315
Please take a seat!

378
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,527
She can communicate with aliens?

379
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,862
That's what she told everyone.

380
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,532
That's why she was taken
to the welfare center.

381
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:36,910
What exactly does the welfare center do?

382
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:41,957
It's like a camp for the mentally ill,
drug addicts, and the homeless.

383
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,292
So, you and Moon Hyungtae are…

384
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,294
We were interns at the welfare center.

385
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,923
Anyway, we saw
all sorts of weird people there.

386
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,675
But the weirdest of them all

387
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,011
was this woman
who communicated with aliens!

388
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,057
A lot of the doctors
took an interest in her because of that.

389
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,809
Hyungtae was the same.

390
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,770
But he didn't stop there.

391
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,148
He became obsessed with her
more and more, and later…

392
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,780
His own mental patient?

393
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,949
If I was

394
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,160
a crazy person,
would you be able to live with me?

395
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,332
-Later, he started saying something weird.
-What did he say?

396
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,127
That he thought something was in her head.

397
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,254
Something that aliens put in there.

398
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:30,964
Anyway,

399
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,593
there are a lot more people like him
in this world than you think.

400
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,221
That's probably why the two of them
could start a church.

401
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,974
-Please go in.
-Keep moving.

402
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,476
Please move to the front. Thank you.

403
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,561
Please go in.

404
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,895
Keep moving.

405
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,484
I'll be straightforward here.

406
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,321
Are there any circumstances
or evidence that show

407
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,366
that Moon Hyungtae or Divine Light Church
have been involved in any sort of crime?

408
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,453
Well, any kind of crime
aside from the mass suicide case?

409
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,623
Like kidnapping?

410
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,375
Probably not.

411
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,794
He doesn't leave any evidence.

412
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,589
He has connections with the local police.

413
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,258
Are you sure there's nothing at all?

414
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,219
Even a tiny bit of a lead?

415
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,516
Look at this, huh?

416
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:28,229
He still sends me stuff like this
whenever they have events.

417
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,858
I'm not sure if I should thank him
for not forgetting about me.

418
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,616
Please sit down!

419
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,091
I said I must go inside!

420
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,802
Let go! Get your hands off!

421
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,054
Let go of me!

422
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,264
Let go!

423
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,683
Your Holiness!

424
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,435
It's me!

425
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,438
I'm the one who brought you steak
in the lunch box!

426
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,440
Car keys! Your Holiness!

427
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,819
Oh! I think she recognized me!

428
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,530
You recognize me, right?

429
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:23,952
It's an honor

430
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,371
to see you again, Your Holiness.

431
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,959
Our believers are really passionate,
aren't they?

432
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,880
Well, so, is this good enough?

433
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,800
We prepared everything just as you asked.

434
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,802
My chip.

435
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,679
Give it back.

436
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:44,931
Excuse me?

437
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,433
My chip.

438
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:50,019
The thing that was implanted
in my head by the aliens.

439
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,271
A chip…

440
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,026
Are you speaking of the gospel?

441
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,072
Where is it now?

442
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,490
"Aliens."

443
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,242
"Chip."

444
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,163
Where did you hear these funny words?

445
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,749
I wasn't trying to be funny.

446
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,083
Give it back.

447
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,710
My chip.

448
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,253
It's mine.

449
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,264
But have you awakened, Your Holiness?

450
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,767
Awakened?

451
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,809
Yes.

452
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm sorry to be presumptuous,

453
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,236
but the last time I saw you,

454
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,365
you failed to be awakened.

455
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,660
But now, do you remember

456
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,205
what Your Holiness was called

457
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,415
to do?

458
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,044
Your Holiness.

459
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,714
I'm afraid.

460
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,510
The burden you have placed
on my shoulders is so heavy,

461
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
and it scares me.

462
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:11,184
To be frank, I'd like to give it to you
and free myself of this burden.

463
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:12,977
However,

464
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,730
everyone outside

465
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:21,736
has been following me this whole time.

466
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,781
Even if you may have returned,

467
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,368
how can I just mindlessly
hand over the gospel

468
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,247
when you don't even remember
what your calling is?

469
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,001
Don't you think so, Your Holiness?

470
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,171
Father.

471
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,218
Do you know how exhausting it is

472
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,721
to come back to life after death?

473
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,557
Of course you don't.

474
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,476
Because I'm the one who was resurrected.

475
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,356
What's that crazy bitch doing right now?

476
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,024
I remember now.

477
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,736
I remember everything.

478
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,323
In middle school, in the field of reeds.

479
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,828
That's where I met the ali…

480
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,126
I met Father Light.

481
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,879
-Sella.
-Sella.

482
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,463
-Sella.
-Sella.

483
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,381
Sella.

484
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,842
Sella.

485
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,640
Give it to me.

486
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,726
I will do it.

487
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,894
Do what?

488
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,231
I will call Him.

489
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,859
I'll call Father Light.

490
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,111
I will call Him and bring salvation.

491
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,947
Isn't that the calling of the Messiah?

492
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,283
Sella!

493
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,701
You need to receive salvation.

494
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,746
You've all waited this long.

495
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,250
Isn't that right, everyone?

496
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,418
You need to be saved.

497
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,129
All of us, together!

498
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:22,982
What?

499
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,985
You cannot go in!

500
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,655
What? Why are you doing this?

501
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,282
Put down the gun.

502
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,327
Put the gun down!

503
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,579
-Huh Bora?
-Jihyo, get out of here.

504
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,793
Cut the crap. Come out so we can go.

505
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,544
-How did you get--
-Fuck off!

506
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,339
Calm down. You can't do this.

507
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,512
Hey. What are you doing?

508
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,059
-Grab her!
-Get her!

509
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,478
-Jihyo! What are you doing?
-Take her out!

510
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,938
-Take her, quickly!
-Let go!

511
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,147
Hey, open the door!

512
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,732
-Jihyo! Let go!
-Open the door!

513
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,442
Get out of here already!

514
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,070
Jihyo! What are you doing?

515
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,201
FROM FLESH TO LIGHT
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

516
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,504
Your Holiness!

517
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,839
Take your hands away!

518
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,881
Don't touch me.

519
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,843
I need to talk to her,
so please leave the room.

520
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,261
Yes, Your Holiness.

521
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,272
You're freaking popular, huh?

522
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,365
Leave.

523
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,784
I'll let you out.

524
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,995
What do you mean, let me out?

525
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,038
What about you?

526
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,042
Where's Captain Price?

527
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,919
-Did you come alone?
-I'm not leaving if you're not.

528
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,509
What the hell are you doing
all the way out here?

529
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,595
You know why I came here.

530
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:16,929
What, you idiot?

531
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,058
You're gonna defend the Earth by yourself?

532
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:21,642
Yeah.

533
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,104
God, you've gotta be kidding me.

534
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,231
Bora.

535
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,860
I know you think that I'm being crazy.

536
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,696
No, I am being crazy. It's true.

537
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,158
But if I want to find my chip,
this is the only way.

538
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,119
Almost everyone is convinced now
that Father's position--

539
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,371
Do you really believe what he says?

540
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,665
No, I don't believe him.

541
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,584
If I get this chip back,

542
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,878
I'll take off with it
the first chance I get.

543
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,005
Not that, you idiot!

544
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,508
I'm talking about
the destruction of mankind.

545
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,426
Do you actually believe all that?

546
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,682
You don't?

547
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,144
You think a UFO will come down to you?

548
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,605
And that the world will end?

549
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,691
Fuck. Does that even make sense?

550
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,236
That's just what those cultist pricks say.

551
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,949
You can't say that.

552
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,410
Why can't I?
Am I not allowed to say something normal?

553
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,122
The reason I came all this way
was because of you, Bora.

554
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:28,251
I never said we should risk our lives
over their nonsense.

555
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,669
-I just--
-No.

556
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,964
Hey, then what does that make me? Huh?

557
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,133
You know,

558
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,760
the field of reeds, the alien chip…

559
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,430
If that was nonsense, what's that make me?
What have I been doing all this time?

560
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,849
-Huh?
-Jihyo.

561
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,601
I'm not the only one who's seen them.
You said you saw them too!

562
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,520
Hey, was that all a lie?

563
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:07,748
No.

564
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,297
So, why

565
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,718
do you have to say
something like that now?

566
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,262
Fuck, I don't know.
I don't care if the world ends.

567
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,516
But you. I can't let them take you.

568
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,226
I'm taking you with me.

569
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,567
Thank you.

570
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,820
I…

571
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,323
I wanted to tell you that in person.

572
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,286
Let's just go. Let's leave and…

573
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,662
Come in!

574
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,375
She's a non-believer. Take her away.

575
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,335
Yes, Your Holiness.

576
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,670
Kick her out.
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

577
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,923
-Cut the crap, Jihyo!
-Take her away!

578
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,424
-Let's go.
-Let go of me!

579
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,508
-Jihyo!
-Come out.

580
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,219
-Ah! Fuck!
-Grab her legs.

581
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,220
Let go!

582
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,846
Let go! Let go of me!

583
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,931
Let go!

584
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,474
Let go!

585
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,567
I can do this.

586
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,492
CCTV RECORDING IN PROGRESS
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

587
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,828
ALTAR

588
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,916
You didn't have to kick her out.

589
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,840
That's for me to decide.

590
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,019
So, to continue what we were--

591
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,688
Do as you please.

592
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,606
What?

593
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,777
I'll give you back the gospel.

594
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,406
Do as you wish, Your Holiness.

595
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,450
All of a sudden?

596
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,997
What you said was right.

597
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,083
True belief is to believe without proof.

598
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,835
With my lack of wisdom,

599
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:21,090
I acted presumptuously
and arrogantly in front of you.

600
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,676
Please forgive me.

601
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,636
Messiah.

602
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,660
Shit!

603
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,082
Sorry to bother you,
but can I get a light?

604
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,337
Do you like those sorts of things?

605
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,131
Aliens, UFOs, things like that?

606
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,091
Ah, no!

607
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,426
It was you, you fucking bitch!

608
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,806
Hey, are you crazy?

609
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,724
I thought that was because of you.

610
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,644
So I really don't know why I came here.

611
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:58,826
