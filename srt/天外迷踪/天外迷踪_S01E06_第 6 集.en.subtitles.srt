1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,428
So, she is Korean, right?

2
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,096
Gosh.

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,516
Look at her eyes.
That's typical Korean beauty.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,851
Very well-defined.

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:22,355
But she seems much younger
than I thought she would be.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,441
-The Messiah, I mean.
-Come on.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,193
Messiahs are usually young.

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,823
Wasn't Jesus 33 years old when he died?

9
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,159
-You're right.
-Oh, you're right. He was.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,995
But since the average life span
is longer now,

11
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,248
isn't 30 then and 30 now much different?

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,461
Wouldn't Jesus have been around 40
or 50 years old by today's standards?

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
You're right!

14
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,631
Or she could just look young
for her age, right?

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,383
-Yes.
-Is that right?

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,686
Say "ah."

17
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,815
But where in the world
are we going to find this person?

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,983
I know, right?

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,318
Gosh, Mom.

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,112
Why didn't she draw a location
like she always does?

21
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,782
I wonder why she drew a portrait instead.

22
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,202
The prophecy being so specific
makes things harder, doesn't it?

23
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,662
But then,

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:25,919
what happens now
to the other Messiah candidates?

25
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,713
I mean, we took them to the hospital

26
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,633
and did all kinds of experiments on them.

27
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
We've been working our asses…

28
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,678
We've been working so hard.

29
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,181
If she was going to reveal
the Messiah so clearly,

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,141
what have we been doing this whole time--

31
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,476
You shall

32
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,730
consider it a joy
whenever you face trials of faith.

33
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:51,986
For you know that the testing
of your faith produces perseverance.

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,615
For us, every moment is a series of tests.

35
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,451
We waver, fear,

36
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,370
and doubt.

37
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,122
No, Dad.

38
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,041
I'm not saying I'm doubting anything.

39
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,712
The only thing more all-consuming
than gambling

40
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,047
is faith.

41
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,218
Believing in something
even without evidence

42
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,346
is what true faith is.

43
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,848
Isn't that right?

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,226
If you need evidence, that's not faith.

45
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,811
That's a criminal trial.

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,355
I apologize.

47
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,026
We are all blind.

48
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,824
Unless the Light shines upon us,

49
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,743
we don't see anything.

50
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,996
Sella.

51
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,914
-Sella.
-Sella.

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,421
Say "ah."

53
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,621
Sister Seo.

54
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,709
Did you happen to see my photo album
that was in the living room?

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,794
No, Dad.

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,296
-Oh.
-I didn't see it.

57
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,965
All right. Go ahead.

58
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,984
Yes, Sister Seo.

59
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,527
I just arrived at the church.

60
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,822
I'm really sorry, Chanwoo,
for making you go back and forth.

61
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,033
Oh, no, it's fine. What did you need?

62
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,744
I'd like to give you a gift, Chanwoo.

63
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,662
What?

64
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,497
Did you say a gift?

65
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,254
The large cabinet behind your desk?

66
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,755
All right.

67
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,844
Wow, what is this?

68
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,180
Right, shall I open it?

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,057
Of course you should open it.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,058
It's a gift!

71
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:27,976
Okay.

72
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,963
Ta-da!

73
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
Did you open it?

74
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,967
Do you like it?

75
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,970
Chanwoo.

76
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,680
Hello?

77
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,597
Ah, yes.

78
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,640
Chanwoo.

79
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,476
Can I ask you a favor?

80
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,815
SISTER SEO HWAJUNG

81
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,067
Use that to bring this person to me.

82
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,362
But do not harm her whatsoever.

83
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,325
If you can bring her to me,
I'll immediately appoint you

84
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,286
as a team leader of the NPCs.

85
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,370
Chanwoo.

86
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,624
You've been working so hard
to get that position, haven't you?

87
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,710
Listen carefully, Chanwoo.

88
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,131
This job is something that I-- I mean…

89
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,426
It's something that we need to do.

90
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,428
Not the other elders.

91
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,306
Do you understand?

92
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,225
Yes.

93
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,794
Cap, the service area!

94
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,463
No, you can eat bibimbap
when we get to Jeonju.

95
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,715
Come on. You need to fill up on gas too!

96
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,384
The gas is full though.

97
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,095
Then what's with the car?

98
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,346
-Do you smell that?
-Hey!

99
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,181
-Smoke!
-What the heck?

100
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,766
-It's smoking, you dipshit!
-What is it?

101
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,184
-Hey!
-Watch out!

102
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,812
PAINT / MAINTENANCE

103
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,904
Oh, the serpentine belt broke, yeah.

104
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,406
-What's that?
-Gosh.

105
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,658
-Do we need that?
-Wait a minute.

106
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,410
Your antifreeze is low.

107
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,079
Well, it's basically a total mess.

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,665
How did you get
all the way here from Seoul?

109
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,501
How long will it take to repair?

110
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,169
Go and have some coffee.

111
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,088
About 20 cups of coffee.

112
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,759
Can we really find him before tomorrow?

113
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,761
-Your boyfriend?
-Huh?

114
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
Oh, I'm not sure.

115
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,808
Why did you break up with your boyfriend?

116
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,604
How should I put it?

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,942
-It's a grown-up thing.
-Jeez.

118
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,029
A boyfriend who disappears
as soon as you break up.

119
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,197
How great.

120
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,117
There's no need to reflect or regret.

121
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,703
What a clean breakup.

122
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,458
What?

123
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,876
What!

124
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,878
Phillip.

125
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:47,550
You're an expert when it comes to aliens,
UFOs, and stuff, right?

126
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,969
Well…

127
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,972
-Yes.
-Then let me ask you one thing.

128
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,225
The people who got abducted by aliens,

129
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,353
do they come back after a while?

130
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,148
Like this person did?

131
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,567
Yes, that is the cliché.

132
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,820
How long does it take for them to return?
A few months? Years?

133
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,447
It doesn't take that long.

134
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,115
The shortest is a few minutes.

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,909
The longest is two to three days.

136
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,703
Most abductees don't remember
what they'd been through.

137
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,580
So then why hasn't my boyfriend

138
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,832
come back yet?

139
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,086
Maybe because he wasn't abducted by a UFO?

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,847
MR. DIRECT KIM

141
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,350
Yes, hello, sir.

142
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,395
Ah, yes.

143
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,568
Well, I'm at Cheonan for a moment.

144
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,530
Cheonan? Why did you go there
all of a sudden?

145
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,702
Sir, I actually thought
about whether I should call you.

146
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,957
We're on our way to a hospital
in Jeonju right now.

147
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,501
It's a place called
New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

148
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:08,673
I think we can find some clues
about my boyfriend's disappearance.

149
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,715
And

150
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,803
some clues
about your daughter's disappearance.

151
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,850
What's going on?

152
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,103
-Hey! Open it!
-What's he doing?

153
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,688
-Cap!
-Hey!

154
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,189
-What is it?
-Open it!

155
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,483
-Open it!
-Are you okay, Captain Price?

156
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,151
Open it!

157
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,903
What is it?

158
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,071
Oh no!

159
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,447
-Are you okay?
-Cap, are you…

160
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,658
-Are you okay?
-Let me see.

161
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,659
Hey!

162
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,244
Show me!

163
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,079
So gross!

164
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,167
Wow, even his fingers are tough.

165
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,423
Phillip. You don't have a license, right?

166
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,341
I didn't get one
to protect the environment.

167
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,176
The average carbon emission per driver--

168
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,511
Ah, dammit!

169
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,763
Who's gonna drive, then?

170
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,919
BAEK-IL NATIONAL WELFARE CENTER

171
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,679
Troll, are we going to make it
to Jeonju at this speed?

172
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,849
Can you at least go
80 kilometers per hour?

173
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,933
Troll?

174
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:43,934
What?

175
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,186
Oh, sure.

176
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,440
-What the…
-Whoa!

177
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,025
No, sorry. I take it back!

178
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,906
Do you think that hospital
was really a secret research institute?

179
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,991
I'm not sure.

180
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,745
But since it was called a welfare center,
it was probably a good disguise.

181
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,374
If an escapee started spouting nonsense,
no one would've thought it was odd.

182
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,711
Wow, so they kidnapped Back Yoonsun
and did experiments and tortured her?

183
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,047
"You fucking met aliens, huh?"
Saying shit like that?

184
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,384
Those are all just rumors!
With that logic, everything can be true.

185
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,427
Why don't you believe anything?

186
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,721
-Are you really even an otaku?
-Moonhole.

187
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,223
You've just crossed the line.

188
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,142
So then, she was kidnapped twice.

189
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,560
That person, Back Yoonsun.

190
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,562
Right? Twice.

191
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,690
Once by aliens.

192
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,858
Once by humans.

193
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,193
Right?

194
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
In a moment, take the right lane
to exit the expressway.

195
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,990
The exit! Take the exit!

196
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,326
Exit!

197
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,285
The exit!

198
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,205
-Wait!
-You have deviated from the route.

199
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,957
Rerouting.

200
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,125
We're screwed!

201
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,133
Hello!

202
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm Oh Sehee, the assistant manager
at Gawa Comprehensive Design Studio.

203
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,723
Uh…

204
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,891
She's an informant.

205
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,892
I mean,

206
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:11,397
what in the world do you want to know
that you'd bring an informant with you?

207
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,402
Ma'am, do you recognize this drawing
from the scene of the mass suicide?

208
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,076
Was it like some sort
of nursing home or something?

209
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,287
The location of the suicide case.

210
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,914
Before it shut down, yes.

211
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,999
Shut down?

212
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,294
Oh. Because of that case?

213
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,757
It was only natural
because that incident was so huge.

214
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,302
After that,
I don't know what happened either.

215
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,015
Now, it's turned
into a psychiatric hospital.

216
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,850
What was the name?

217
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,230
Oh. New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

218
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,025
I did some research too.

219
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,443
Oh.

220
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,614
The people who died back then,

221
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,908
were they a religious group?

222
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,202
Like a Christian cult?

223
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,870
Divine Light Church.

224
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,705
Damn it. I got goosebumps.

225
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,124
I even remember the name.

226
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,796
According to the people from that church,
the ones who committed suicide

227
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,423
were eccentric believers.

228
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,383
So the church considered them a headache.

229
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,470
So they were saying
that their church is normal,

230
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,348
but a few cultist members caused a mess--

231
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,265
How typical.

232
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,768
It's a textbook example of what cults say.

233
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,147
I thought the same thing.

234
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,236
That's why I started
looking into the head pastor.

235
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
And then?

236
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,404
What happened?

237
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,741
It was closed.

238
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,659
What?

239
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,702
The investigation was closed?

240
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,289
-Why?
-I don't know. It was just shut down!

241
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,835
Fuck, anyone can see
this is not a normal mass suicide case.

242
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,752
-Right?
-Yes!

243
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,420
But I was told to close the case.

244
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,759
So I went to the higher-ups, made a scene,
and quit doing police work.

245
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,678
Damn it.

246
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,141
Ma'am.

247
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,270
Do you still happen to have

248
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,022
the files from the investigation?

249
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,335
Dammit, what's wrong with this?
Freaking stupid.

250
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,046
Still no signal?

251
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,299
Damn, I don't know what I need to press.

252
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,468
We're lost, aren't we?

253
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,762
Aha.

254
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,432
Fuck, I had no clue.
Thanks for letting us know.

255
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,393
Huh? Where are we?

256
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,104
Whoa, damn!

257
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,564
We're in a jungle!

258
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,567
Hey, how can you get lost
with the GPS turned on?

259
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,652
All you have to do
is go where it tells you to go!

260
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,071
There are so many things to look at.
It's confusing.

261
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,949
I have to watch the road, the GPS,
and three different mirrors!

262
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,327
Troll, please don't drive again.

263
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,746
The fact that we are still alive
is a miracle.

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,084
What was that?

265
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,340
Fuck, that really hurt!

266
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,469
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

267
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,516
Again!

268
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,434
One!

269
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,353
-One, two, three!
-Two!

270
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,898
Again!

271
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,066
One!

272
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,150
-Two!
-Two!

273
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,234
-Three!
-Three!

274
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,909
Ow, my back!

275
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,118
Stop!

276
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,538
Guys.

277
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,874
Shaking your heads won't do it.

278
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,376
You need to use your legs!

279
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,087
Is it not budging?

280
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,715
Hey, Huh Bora. Where are you going?

281
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,133
For a smoke. Fuck.

282
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,803
How did you not see this huge hole though?

283
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,846
This is basically a canyon!

284
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,264
Phillip, look at me, okay?

285
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,392
When you push, don't just push.
Use your abs.

286
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,686
-Hold your breath--
-Just shut up!

287
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,104
Shut up?

288
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,023
Phillip, I'm telling you this
so you don't hurt your back.

289
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,775
Look. This isn't just breathing.

290
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,611
It's called bracing.
It's supposed to protect your backbone.

291
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,824
What a shitty car.

292
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,883
Bora. Take a look at this.

293
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,721
You know how we made a circle
because we couldn't take that exit?

294
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,305
Then shouldn't we be…

295
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,517
Hey.

296
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,233
The destination is within one kilometer.

297
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,662
Check.

298
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,583
I joined the Discord voice channel.
Can you hear me?

299
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,209
Bora, can you hear me?

300
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,127
Bora?

301
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,796
Of course she can.
She's right next to you.

302
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,758
It's like we're playing PUBG, right?

303
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,634
Okay. Confirmed.

304
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,721
But why are we using Discord
in a place like this?

305
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,473
To know each other's location.

306
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,350
What? But we're all together.
Why do we need that?

307
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,562
Isn't it a bit strange?

308
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,939
Why did the investigation suddenly stop?

309
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,941
I bet there wasn't enough evidence
to charge them.

310
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,402
Is there someone important involved?

311
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,032
Would you please not flip through those?
They're already in tatters.

312
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,576
Why are you licking your finger?

313
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:58,952
Huh?

314
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,621
Why, what is it?

315
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,999
This must be him. The pastor of the cult.

316
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,169
But it's strange.

317
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,630
Why did they come together
to die in a hospital?

318
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,887
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

319
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,187
It looks like no one is here.

320
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,397
We split into two teams once we're in.

321
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,565
What?

322
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,359
Cap is on my team.

323
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,320
-The rest will go with Jihyo.
-Okay.

324
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,404
-All right.
-Confirmed.

325
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,407
Wait, isn't this trespassing…

326
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,963
-I don't think it's gonna open.
-Hey, Cap. Break the lock.

327
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,805
Aren't you in the 500 kg Club?
You can't break a lock?

328
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,974
Even if I were in the One-ton Club,
I couldn't do it.

329
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,643
At least try. Why do you even work out?

330
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,688
There is no purpose for working out.
Working out itself is the purpose.

331
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,416
Check out Lovely's upper body strength.
Her physique is amazing.

332
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,168
That was dope. My turn.

333
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,880
Donghyuk, be careful! You could die!

334
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,841
Okay, me too.

335
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,428
Cap.

336
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,596
Oh, come on.

337
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,184
My gosh.

338
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,772
-Hey, you got a grip, right?
-Yeah.

339
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,150
Pull yourself up.
Not with your arms but your back.

340
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,320
-What? How do I pull with my back?
-Just pull as hard as you can.

341
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,829
What are you doing?
I said pull yourself up.

342
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,539
I'm pulling. Why am I not going up?

343
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,790
Ah, seriously!

344
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,001
Squeeze your chest
and close your rib cage.

345
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,378
-Channel that strength to your erector…
-What's that?

346
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,723
Hey, quickly! Put me down!

347
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,716
NEWBEGINNINGS PEACE CORPS
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

348
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,636
Hey, Jihyo.

349
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:04,721
What?

350
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,639
Look.

351
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,058
Look at what it says on their backs.

352
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,271
Isn't that the group?
The one Direct Kim talked about.

353
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,189
NEWBEGINNINGS PEACE CORPS
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

354
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,607
The NPCs.

355
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,459
Hey, Moonhole.
Why don't we just leave now?

356
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,629
We're all going to get reported for this.

357
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,588
Let's go in.

358
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,589
What?

359
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,467
I need to see what's in that truck.

360
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
No! No way!

361
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,306
With your physique,
how will you jump over and not get caught?

362
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:53,895
What?

363
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,858
All vehicles have arrived.

364
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,320
Before we begin,
we will be reciting the Cleansing Prayer.

365
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,488
All volunteers,
excluding security personnel,

366
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,907
are to meet in the parking lot. Over.

367
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,086
Stop.

368
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Stop right there.

369
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,258
What brings you here?

370
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,890
-I got into an accident. Please help.
-Sorry?

371
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,893
My car is stuck.

372
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,895
I got into an accident.

373
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,647
Anyone would think
he's fucking suspicious--

374
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,942
What is he saying?

375
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,613
I'm asking why you are here.

376
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,117
The car, accident, I was…

377
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,577
I was just passing by…

378
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,580
I got lost!

379
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,459
All right.

380
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,754
Well, anyway,
this is private property past this point.

381
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,339
You can't go further.

382
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,050
-So go back the way--
-My car is stuck!

383
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,719
Help me, please!

384
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,184
Help me, please.

385
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,647
I mean, where even is your car?

386
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,149
Over there!

387
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,569
This is the front gate.

388
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,322
There's a suspicious person here.

389
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,333
Well, do you think
it'll be difficult to take out?

390
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,611
Hello!

391
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,697
You said you were just passing by?

392
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,700
Ah, yes, that's right.
I was going to my uncle's house--

393
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,119
Then you should've kept going.
Why are you causing trouble?

394
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,537
My hands are already full.

395
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,372
I'm sorry…

396
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,666
-Hey, get his car out.
-Yes, ma'am.

397
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,897
What are you doing? Get in.

398
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,482
Sorry?

399
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,108
Ah, right!

400
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,831
Get in the front.
Why are you sitting there?

401
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,879
Oh, you're right.

402
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,651
Jeez! Release the parking brake!

403
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,611
The parking…

404
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,613
What was that again?

405
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,118
It hasn't been long
since I bought the car, so…

406
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
Don't you know how to drive?

407
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,631
Who did you come here with?

408
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,557
Clean in flesh and spirit.

409
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,810
You are the Light in the darkness.

410
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,312
Free us from our eternal fetters
of foolishness,

411
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,482
crafted by our sins from our past life.

412
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,109
Under the worthiness of our Holy Mother,

413
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:13,655
lead us away from the traps of quarrels
and hatred and towards your Light.

414
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,824
-Sella!
-Sella!

415
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,743
So there really was an alien cult.

416
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,871
I guess not everything
Direct said was a lie.

417
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,624
Bora, give it to me.

418
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:30,046
Give us the courage to take down
the tents of ignorant souls.

419
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,299
Hey! Don't stick it out so far.

420
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,217
If we get caught here, we're fucked.

421
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,262
Hello? Yes, Mom.

422
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,763
-Sella!
-Sella!

423
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,099
I told you I'm sleeping over
at a friend's house.

424
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,852
That again? That's not true!

425
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,606
Do you think I'm always out having fun?

426
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,109
I'm doing something important right now,
so please hang up.

427
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,236
-Want some?
-No.

428
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,780
There's this assessment from school.

429
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,449
-Hello?
-I don't want to tell you.

430
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,409
-Dajung.
-What?

431
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,744
Can he not hear me?

432
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
Mom, do you know how old I am?

433
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,998
Dajung, have you found a bathroom?

434
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,125
-Do I need to tell you everything?
-The bathroom?

435
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,961
-Why's he using your real name?
-I told you I'm sleeping at a friend's.

436
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,048
I even told you in advance.
I told you this morning.

437
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,299
Mom, you forgot.

438
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
Dajung…

439
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,762
What do you mean you didn't forget?

440
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,181
Have I ever lied to you
and gone somewhere else?

441
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,183
That's an exception.

442
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,684
Yeah, what's up?

443
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,269
Oh, Dajung!

444
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,897
How far did you go?

445
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,984
The hospital employees are next to me,
helping me pull the car out.

446
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,152
So come back quickly.

447
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,238
You know I can't drive!

448
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,408
Let's hurry, Dajung.
My uncle is going to be worried.

449
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,745
I said I'd be back tomorrow.

450
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,414
Yeah… Okay. I'll be right there.

451
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,999
I agree, but…

452
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,502
-Go, quick.
-Have I ever caused trouble?

453
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,672
What do you mean by that?

454
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,757
I have friends
to have sleepovers with too!

455
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,966
Hey, Cap!

456
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,927
-Take him too. He's loud!
-Stop cursing, Mom.

457
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,098
Why is everything you say so deprecating?

458
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,519
You're starting that again?
I said it's not true!

459
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,270
Don't swear at me.

460
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,690
I can do it tomorrow.

461
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,237
Can you see inside the truck?

462
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,740
You are the Light in the darkness.

463
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,076
But what are the NPCs doing here anyway?

464
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,328
How is this hospital
connected to the church?

465
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,415
…for teaching, rebuking, correcting,
and training in righteousness.

466
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,085
Free us from our eternal fetters
of foolishness due to our sins…

467
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,213
Do you think Direct Kim was right?

468
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,049
-About?
-About his daughter and Siguk?

469
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,802
Maybe they kidnapped them.

470
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,389
What? You saw the crop circle
with your own eyes.

471
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,725
Yes. So they were also abducted by aliens.

472
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,810
What do you mean?

473
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,896
Just listen.

474
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,900
The thing that happened to Back Yoonsun
happened to them too.

475
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,528
She was abducted by aliens, came back,

476
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,697
but then kidnapped again by humans.

477
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,992
Then she was dragged away to… What is it?

478
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,161
The secret research institute.

479
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,247
The people who got kidnapped by aliens

480
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,999
are getting kidnapped again?

481
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,543
-Sella!
-Sella!

482
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,129
…and move forward on a path
of ascension and unity.

483
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,632
-Sella!
-Sella!

484
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,542
One, two, three!

485
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
Hey!

486
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,513
Do you see anything?

487
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,022
Dammit, what are you saying?

488
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,411
They're loading things into the truck,
but I can't tell what.

489
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,497
Why?
Because I can't see anything from here.

490
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,832
Dammit.

491
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,634
Bora.

492
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,221
Bora!

493
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,431
Bora!

494
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,767
Bora! Hey!

495
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,522
Hey!

496
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,399
Huh Bora!

497
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,901
Hey, what are you doing there?
Are you insane?

498
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,988
What are you doing? Come on!

499
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,621
Did you hear that
they'll be strengthening security?

500
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,374
Yeah, I heard
they're not recruiting more volunteers.

501
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,545
I know a lot of brothers
who wish to join the NPC.

502
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,007
-You're staying after this, right?
-Probably.

503
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,385
-Did you get any sleep?
-No.

504
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,971
Dammit!

505
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:34,267
Nowadays, the congregation is more helpful
with joining the corps than the leaders.

506
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,478
We should work hard.

507
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,732
These days, being a part of the NPC
is a sign of your faith.

508
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,984
Everyone around me is going crazy.

509
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,486
I get so many calls
from the brothers every day.

510
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,287
Hey. Huh Bora.

511
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,456
Yeah?

512
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,959
Go and film the inside.

513
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,836
-What?
-You go in.

514
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,171
I'll check the truck.

515
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,383
Let's meet at the car after we're done.

516
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,429
-Okay?
-Okay.

517
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,642
Wow! It's really out!

518
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,769
It's out!

519
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,148
Hey, thank you so much.

520
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,067
-Thanks to the two of you--
-Where is it?

521
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,195
-Where's your uncle's house?
-What?

522
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,322
You said you were going
to your uncle's house.

523
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,491
What's the name of the area?

524
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,995
Oh, it's somewhere near here…

525
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,746
Something "ri."

526
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,041
Ri?

527
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:22,959
Ri…

528
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,836
Ri?

529
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh, is it Hoedong-ri?

530
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
Yes, that's right. Hoedong-ri!

531
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,804
-Hoedong-ri?
-Yes!

532
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,100
I was trying to go there
but got totally lost.

533
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,853
The roads are rough around here.

534
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,312
There aren't many signs either.

535
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,565
For a first-timer, these country roads…

536
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,029
There's no place by that name here.

537
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,116
Why…

538
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,367
Why are you doing this?

539
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,660
Search the car.

540
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,578
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,248
Who are you?

542
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,916
I…

543
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,960
I already told you.

544
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,047
I was just passing… passing by…

545
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,131
Boss.

546
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,313
Where are your friends?

547
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,858
Where are they?

548
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,241
I'm sick and tired
of this parent-child relationship.

549
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,578
Why do all parents think
everything their child says is bullshit?

550
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,830
You do say a lot of bullshit.

551
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,334
I mean, I told her I'd be sleeping over
at a friend's place before I left.

552
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,337
So, why is she acting
like it's her first time hearing it?

553
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,588
Hey!

554
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,924
What were you all doing here?

555
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,383
Aren't you going to answer?

556
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,094
Answer me!

557
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,387
What were you doing?

558
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,723
-Where are your friends?
-What the heck?

559
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,101
-Where did they go?
-Phillip…

560
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,478
Aren't you going to tell me
where your friends went?

561
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,743
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

562
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,874
RESTRICTED AREA

563
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,960
CLOSED WARD

564
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,255
Oh, room 301 is emptied out now.

565
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,717
That's being taken care of in the lobby…

566
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,817
Hey, Jihyo.

567
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,945
-Can you hear me?
-Dammit, you scared me!

568
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,154
This place is strange.

569
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,907
Why isn't there a single patient
in this hospital?

570
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,661
There are so many rooms

571
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,538
but no nurses or doctors.

572
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,627
Hey, be quiet!
I'm not in a position to talk right now.

573
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,353
Shit!

574
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,105
Damn it!

575
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,648
Shit!

576
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,236
YOU CAME IN THE FLESH,
CLOTHED IN RIGHTEOUSNESS THROUGH THE LIGHT

577
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,464
Huh?

578
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,633
-Did you lock the door?
-No.

579
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,302
It must be stuck again.

580
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,886
Try to lift it up and pull.

581
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,891
Take better care of the facility, okay?

582
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,061
-Move out of the way.
-Why isn't it working?

583
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,190
-What's wrong with it?
-Lift it up.

584
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,525
Dammit!

585
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,284
We were really just passing by--

586
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,787
Hey, if you say you were passing by
one more time, I'll shoot you.

587
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,961
-Is he crying?
-Boss, you should see this.

588
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,486
Cap, go!

589
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,031
Dammit!

590
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,082
Whoa, he's fast!

591
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,752
Donghyuk!

592
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,962
Cap! Quick! Hurry!

593
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,760
What's that sound?

594
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,389
Donghyuk!

595
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,392
What was that sound?

596
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,274
-Cap, these bastards have guns!
-They shot at us?

597
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,609
-Cap, hurry!
-Don't rush me!

598
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,744
Phillip, can you see her?
She's on our back!

599
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,037
-Dajung!
-Be careful!

600
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,752
-What the--
-Phillip!

601
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,171
He's screaming! I'll move him to that car!

602
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,216
Where? Where did you get shot?

603
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,926
Don't die! Phillip was shot!

604
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,730
This is Security Team One. Code 17.

605
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,649
I repeat. Code 17.

606
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,152
-Gosh, what's wrong with this?
-I repeat. Code 17.

607
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,778
All members, stop what you're doing.

608
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,613
Vehicles and security to the front gate.

609
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,198
-What's going on? Get outside!
-Over.

610
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,616
Jeez.

611
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,535
Follow me!

612
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,270
NEW HOPE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

613
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,058
Hey, Jihyo.

614
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
Can you hear me?

615
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,231
You were right.

616
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,774
Huh?

617
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,068
About what?

618
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,447
They're all in here, the people.

619
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,367
The people?

620
00:42:58,909 --> 00:42:59,827
Who?

621
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,912
They're all unconscious.

622
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:05,916
They have those weird VR headsets on
and are just lying there!

623
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,586
What are you talking about?

624
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,004
People who were kidnapped!

625
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,506
The NPCs are moving people right now!

626
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,429
About his daughter and Siguk?

627
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,639
Maybe they kidnapped them.

628
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,766
Wait…

629
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,103
Shit, these crazy bastards!

630
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,938
How many people have they kidnapped?

631
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,357
Bora, what… what about Siguk?

632
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,985
Is Siguk in there?

633
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,240
There are only women here.

634
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,036
Did they already move all the men?

635
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,830
Have you checked the truck yet?

636
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,083
Aren't all the men in there?

637
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:57,444
I WILL SHOW YOU GREAT
AND HIDDEN THINGS YOU DO NOT KNOW

638
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,420
Back Yoonsun--

639
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:15,921
Beautiful, isn't she?

640
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:21,468
She was quite the looker
when she was young.

641
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,761
Who are you?

642
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,264
I'm the one who should be asking that.

643
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,015
This is my hospital.

644
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,732
Could you please put that down?

645
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,914
You must be an extremely curious person

646
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,000
to come all the way here.

647
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,963
You can call it a sickness.

648
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,676
Great sickness, that is.

649
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,306
That's how young people should be.

650
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,644
Would you like me to tell you
who that person is?

651
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,649
Back Yoonsun from the Seoul UFO Incident.

652
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:21,403
She encountered aliens
like the people lying out there.

653
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,363
Why?

654
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,450
Is there something else
you want to teach me?

655
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,914
You're very clever for your age.

656
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,416
Gosh, you surprised me.
Goodness, that's sobering!

657
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,174
All right.

658
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,676
Let's do this.

659
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,971
Let's take turns
asking each other questions, yes?

660
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,891
If I answer a question,
you have to answer mine too.

661
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,892
What do you think?

662
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,816
Sure. That seems fair.

663
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,323
What is this place exactly?

664
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,412
This is the place
where my wife and I first met.

665
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,122
Don't tell me Back is your--

666
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,792
My turn.

667
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,674
You're the one
who took my photo album, right?

668
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,469
That's right.

669
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,722
Would you return it to me?

670
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,269
My turn.

671
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,988
I think I have a good idea
of what you're doing here.

672
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:48,156
But that's not a question.

673
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,583
Why are you kidnapping them?
The people who encountered aliens.

674
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,087
What in the world do you want from them?

675
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,468
Salvation.

676
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,434
Salvation? What are you talking about?

677
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,147
Even if I tell you,
you wouldn't understand.

678
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,985
Whatever. Speak clearly.

679
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,739
This woman.

680
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,491
What is so special about her?

681
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,705
What on earth are you guys looking for?

682
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,167
I'd like to tell you everything,

683
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,921
but it's my turn to ask,

684
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,006
and there's not much time.

685
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,216
All right.

686
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,095
My last question.

687
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,267
Why am I confessing
all of these things to you?

688
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,185
Do you know?

689
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,314
Because you're going to kill me anyway.

690
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,109
How clever!

691
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,115
Hey, it's Dad.

692
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,868
There's a bug in my room.

693
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,286
Come get it for me.

694
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,210
I'm sorry to continue stating the obvious,

695
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,713
but personally, I think it's such a shame.

696
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,218
I think it'd be really fun
to have a drink with you

697
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,387
and chat about many things.

698
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,308
Don't you think so?

699
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,315
You're right.

700
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,115
You really do only state the obvious.

701
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,950
Can you put that out?

702
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,578
What's wrong? I'm going to die anyway.

703
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,999
Why? Is this a non-smoking area?

704
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Or is it because

705
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,261
of some fucking precious memory?

706
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,319
Oh no!

707
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,196
No!

708
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,282
Gosh!

709
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,706
Hey! She's getting away! Get her!

710
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,542
-Come here! We can't lose her!
-Get her!

711
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,626
Stop right there!

712
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,794
Stop!

713
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,672
-Hey, catch her!
-What's happening?

714
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,591
-Catch her!
-Stop right there!

715
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,176
-Dammit!
-Stop!

716
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,553
-Hurry!
-Where is she?

717
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,056
-That way?
-Yes!

718
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,474
Oh fuck!

719
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,309
Stay there.

720
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,856
Huh Bora! Here!

721
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,858
-Hey, you!
-Hey!

722
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,152
-Surround her!
-Get in! Quick!

723
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,533
Close the door!

724
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,623
Dammit! Go away!

725
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,999
Hey! Step on it!

726
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,375
Okay, wait.

727
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,211
I don't know what to press!

728
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,428
-Dammit!
-What do I do?

729
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,097
Move!

730
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,483
We're going!

731
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,276
Oh, hey!

732
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,197
We're going!

733
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,202
Just go!

734
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,495
-Go!
-Okay!

735
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,874
Hold on tight!

736
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,043
Go!

737
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,879
Go!

738
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,549
Go!

739
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,348
-Block the truck!
-Get them!

740
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,266
Dammit.

741
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,600
Huh?

742
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,354
Go this way!

743
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,856
Hey!

744
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,362
Get out!

745
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,613
Get out!

746
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,698
Get out of the car!

747
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:40,782
What do we do?

748
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,744
Dammit!

749
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,787
Bora?

750
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,164
Come out!

751
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,832
Hey!

752
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,294
-Let's get out!
-Huh?

753
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,551
-One.
-One!

754
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,386
-Two.
-Two!

755
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,096
-Three!
-Three!

756
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,058
Fuck! Hey!

757
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,437
Dammit!

758
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,980
You!

759
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,064
Hey!

760
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,694
Grab her!

761
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,612
Catch her!

762
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:20,780
Shit!

763
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,832
-Jihyo, what are you doing?
-Huh? Hey!

764
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,375
You go first!

765
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,377
-Hey! Open the door!
-What about you?

766
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,463
I'll figure it out!

767
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,506
Let's meet at the car later!

768
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,424
Got it?

769
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,302
Get the other girl! Go around!

770
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,387
-That way!
-Hey! Go now!

771
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,223
Go!

772
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,807
Go!

773
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,267
That way!

774
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,227
Go!

775
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,230
Hey!

776
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:58,944
Come out!

777
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,408
Get her!

778
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,204
Give me back

779
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,289
my ex-boyfriend!

780
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,208
You bastards!

781
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,145
Hey!

782
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,648
-Get her!
-Get her!

783
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,590
Dammit!

784
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,175
CONNECTED
TO UFO MINOR GALLERY CHANNEL

785
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,639
Hey, Cap!

786
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,141
Cap! Back Donghyuk!

787
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,248
Cap! Back Donghyuk!

788
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,166
Where are you?

789
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,376
Is it my liver?

790
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,670
Did it hit my liver?

791
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,588
No.

792
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,798
Everything…

793
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,052
Everything is so dark…

794
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,429
It's dark because it's night.
You're not dying. You're okay.

795
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,264
Don't lie to me.

796
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,058
What the heck is going on?

797
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,225
What are you guys doing?

798
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,644
Oh. It's the sound
of Phillip after getting shot.

799
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,937
What, shot?

800
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,608
It was a rubber bullet.

801
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,527
He won't be able to do planks for a while.

802
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,530
Wow, that's dope. Can I have that?

803
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,865
What are you talking about?

804
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,076
Explain to me what happened.

805
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,578
-Where are you? What are you doing?
-Hey, Moonhole.

806
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,414
These punks have guns,
and they're completely insane.

807
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,000
Where in the world did you bring us?

808
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,713
It's okay.

809
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,674
That's not what's important right now.
Those bastards got Jihyo!

810
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,135
Talk later. We're busy.

811
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,970
What? Hey, Cap!

812
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:31,888
Cap!

813
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,306
Cap…

814
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,066
Hey, Jihyo. Can you hear me?

815
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,943
Jihyo, what happened?

816
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,250
Don't move. Stay right there.

817
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,835
Stay still.

818
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,422
Fucking hell.

819
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,090
-Stop!
-Stop!

820
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,091
Get her already!

821
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,843
-This way!
-Come on!

822
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,010
Get her.

823
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,012
-Hurry!
-Stop!

824
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,347
I said, stop!

825
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,765
Hey, stop running!

826
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,267
Hey, follow me!

827
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,603
Security Team Two, where are you?
State your current location.

828
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,189
This is Security Team Two.
Our current location is…

829
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:28,111
Can you hear me?
Did you catch the intruder?

830
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,280
What is this?

831
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,574
Security Team Two,
report your current situation!

832
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,615
Direct Kim?

833
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,795
Captain Price!

834
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,464
Over here! Hurry!

835
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,716
Quickly! Yes! This way!

836
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,371
Run quickly!

837
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,458
Oh, it's a hit! We got her!

838
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,961
Quickly!

839
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,379
-Run to her!
-Run!

840
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,509
Go and get her!

841
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,470
Come get her, you idiots!

842
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,388
Yes, ma'am!

843
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,973
Run!

844
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,667
Wait!

845
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,753
Wait, stop!

846
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,355
Messiah, her Holiness!

847
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,776
Your Holiness!

848
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,154
-Your Holiness!
-Your Holiness!

849
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,574
-Your Holiness!
-Messiah, your holiness!

850
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,409
-Your Holiness!
-Messiah!

851
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,077
Your Holiness!

852
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,209
-Your Holiness!
-Your Holiness!

853
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,321
Are you all right?

854
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:05,203
It took a while for us to identify you
because you didn't have an ID.

855
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,706
Once you're fully recovered,
we'll help you get back to your country.

856
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,586
But why would you come all the way
to Bangkok for a suicide attempt?

857
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,756
Gosh.

858
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,176
Let me check something.

859
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,513
Your name is Lee Siguk, correct?

860
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,274
Where am I?

861
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,360
