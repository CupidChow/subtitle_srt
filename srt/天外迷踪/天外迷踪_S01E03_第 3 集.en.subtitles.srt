00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,765
Like a…

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,770
Like a wandering star

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,855
Last one.

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,109
Just like that star in the sky

6
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,446
My heart will become a star

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,991
And shine forever

8
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,659

Wow, you're all so good!

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,834
All right, who should lead us next?

12
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,006
Miss Junghwa!
Miss Junghwa, you're good at singing!

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,175
Oh, what are you talking about?

14
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,676
No, I can't sing well.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,139
Come on. If you start it off,
everyone will join you one by one.

16
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,975
-Just one song!
-Oh, I'm busy with this. I can't.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,644
I need to finish this by tonight. I can't.

18
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,897
-Come on. We can do that together.
-Just try it.

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
-Let's sing.
-You do it, then.

20
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,859
Miss Junghwa?

21
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,611
-Huh?
-Miss Junghwa.

22
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,154
Your granddaughter came to see you.

23
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,697
-It's Younggi.
-Younggi's here.

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
Welcome.

25
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,700
Look who's here?

26
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,744
Hi, Younggi.

27
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,623
How did you make it all the way here
with those little feet of yours?

28
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:22,874
By taxi.

29
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,751
-Oh my.
-Wow.

30
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,002
Gosh.

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,170
Oh my gosh.

32
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,507
-How sweet.
-Oh, sweetie, you're so smart!

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,800
Goodness!

34
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,968
All right.

35
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:39,224
Everyone, since we have a guest,
why don't we all say the Cleansing Prayer?

36
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,059
-Okay.
-We're praying now. Praying.

37
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,270
-Everyone remembers it, right?
-Yes.

38
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,314
Clean in flesh.

39
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,192
-And clean in spirit.
-And clean in spirit.

40
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,778
You are the Light in the darkness.

41
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,446
May your Light be used

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,534
for teaching, rebuking, correcting,
and training in righteousness.

43
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,868
-Sella.
-Sella.

44
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,341
Sweetheart?

45
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,594
What are you doing here?
Why haven't you gone home yet?

46
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
It's so late.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,057
Oh my.

48
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,851
Are you all right?

49
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,228
What's wrong?

50
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,187
What's…

51
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,215
There's no one on this earth
who hasn't felt the grace of your Light.

52
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,801
May you spread your true love on the paths

53
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,804
that lead to the road of truth,
which transcends all cleansing.

54
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,267
Give us the courage to take down
the tents of ignorant souls!

55
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,977
-Sella.
-Sella.

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,149
Please forgive the wickedness of those
who are not clean in flesh and spirit!

57
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,567
-Sella.
-Sella.

It's not the first time
this has been found in Korea.

59
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,043
At first glance,
this looks like the pattern of Cygnus…

60
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,463
-Do you know what it is?
-It's very familiar.

61
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,839
Within Cygnus,

62
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,468
it reminds me of Kepler-22 a little bit.

I've even reached out to professors
who are studying hieroglyphics,

65
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,060
but you're the first
to recognize what this is.

66
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,647
You've done well by coming here.

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,148
You can't trust those people.

68
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,901
The college professors
and government employees.

69
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,277
Do not ever trust them.

70
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,363
They all have the same agenda.

71
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,283
It's definitely something from Andromeda,
this circular structure…

72
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,620
Ma'am, if this is
some sort of writing system,

73
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,747
is there a meaning to it?

74
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,123
Of course.

75
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,001
This is a sort of message.

76
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,713
What kind?

77
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,385
It's likely a message related
to what they did at this location.

78
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,638
They never leave a trace without a reason.

Is it something about Siguk?

No, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,804
That's not why I called you.

110
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,306
Oh, I see.

111
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,851
Well, the reason that I called you is

112
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,981
I don't know if I should tell you this,
or how I should…

-Please don't be too shocked.
-Yes, go ahead.

114
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,446
Ms. Hong, well, someone reported you.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,281
What?

116
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,369
That person is here at the station,
and she's demanding to see you.

117
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,080
So you're saying what happened was

118
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,084
this person hit you with a motorcycle?

119
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,920
What are you talking about?
I told you it's my scooter.

120
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:04,257
What is it, then?
You're the one who hit her?

121
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,470
No.

122
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,014
I was riding on my scooter.

123
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,684
She came running at me. She ran into me.

124
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,270
She smashed it. Smashed my scooter.

125
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:19,981
Is that possible?

126
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,819
-Isn't it usually the other way around?
-I wrote it all down.

127
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,571
What's wrong with your reading ability?

128
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,868
I'm asking because what you wrote here
doesn't make any sense.

129
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,705
On foot.
She caught up to your scooter on foot?

130
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,665
Does this make sense to you?

131
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,749
Hey!

132
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,341
I guess this country's system
really does work well.

133
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,926
What, is this the person?

134
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,096
Did you really report me?

135
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,848
I was in the middle of it.

136
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,643
By the way, did you find your boyfriend?

137
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,354
You said he was kidnapped by aliens!

138

Hey. Miss?

140

-Follow me.
-Where?

141
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,006
You need to pay for that.
Do you want me to finish that report?

00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,057
Hello!

143
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,063
-Detective…
-Oh, hey.

144
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,857
Is it over with? That lady's report?

145
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,445
Yes, I'll drop it off at your house
on my way home, Ms. Hong. Yes.

146
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,447
No, no need to be sorry.

147
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,865
All right, I'll do that.

148
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,953
Were you able to reach a settlement?
How much compensation did she ask for?

149
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,371
The compensation?

150
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,374
I'm paying for it right now,

151
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,292
big time.

152
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,961
Another beer here!

153
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,630
Yes, coming right up!

154
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,133
Don't worry. She's agreed
to settle everything with this.

155
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,887
Yes, thank you, Detective. Yes, okay!

156
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,395
Uh…

157
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,565
How have you been?

00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,566
Uh…

00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,783
Is it going well?

163
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,742
No.

164
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,244
This is my first meal in two days.

165
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,662
Oh.

166
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,332
Are your parents doing well?

167
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,334
They cut ties with me. We don't speak.

168
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,965
Ah, right.

169
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,218
I heard you also went
to another school back then.

170
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,386
Yeah.

171
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,138
I was bullied like crazy

172
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,308
because of the rumor that you dumped me
after you and I dated.

173
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,563
Another otoro here, please!

174
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,315
Coming right up!

175
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,278
"Glue Girl."

176
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,946
I suddenly remembered.

177
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,824
Huh Bora's middle school nickname.

178
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,870
Huh Bora

179
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,247
is my dark past.

180
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,460
I don't remember things clearly.

181
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,212
I'm not sure when she offered me the glue

182
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,007
and why I decided to take it.

183
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,887
Do you want to try just a sip?

184
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,559
I was found unconscious
72 hours after I left home to see Bora.

185
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,202
-You need to go look for your boyfriend?
-Huh?

186
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,205
I read it. Your message in my guest book.

187
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,750
It was pretty funny.

188
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,669
Funny?

189
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,005
You just sounded so freaking desperate.

190
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,926
You were babbling nonsense
to a total stranger.

191
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,680
It seemed sincere, in a way.

192
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,890
In a way!

193
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,644
If you're done eating, I'll get going.

194
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,771
Why didn't you report it to the police?

195
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,566
I mean, fuck,
if your boyfriend disappeared,

196
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,236
you should have gone
straight to the police.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,406
Instead, you were asking
what this shit is.

198
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,490
So random.

199
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,325
I did go to the police, but--

200
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,952
They said it was a simple runaway?

201
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,080
Then they showed you
a bunch of evidence, right?

202
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,999
Witness statements,

203
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,001
call history, bank account details?

204
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,670
Blah, blah…

205
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,172
A bunch of random documents.

206
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,012
What are you talking about?

207
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,684
Do you know

208
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,895
how easy it is to fabricate things
in a bureaucratic society

209
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,189
that's run with pieces of paper?

210
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,317
It's easier than uploading
a YouTube video.

211
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,530
A few strokes on a keyboard
can turn bullshit into fact.

212
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,991
-But--
-What are you saying? Fabricate?

213
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,325
Who would do that to Siguk?

214
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,493
But!

215
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
You didn't believe them.

216
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,749
That's why you decided
to find him yourself.

217
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,916
Right?

218
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,213
Why didn't you believe them?

219
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,466
What bothered you so much?

220
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,434
You saw something, didn't you?

221
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,359
What did you see?

222
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,946
Even if…

223
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,825
Even if I tell you, you won't believe me.

224
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,123
-Pay the bill.
-Huh?

225
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,043
Come with me for a sec.
I have something to show you.

226
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,595
Oh Lord.

227
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,931
Oh my Lord!

228
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,434
How is she ever going to get married?

229
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,273
How many all-nighters did she pull?

230
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,694
Gosh, this little punk…

231
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,447
UFO ABNORMALITIES
TYPES OF ALIENS

232
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,660
TYPES OF ALIENS

233
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,995
March 6, 2018.

234
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,832
The story begins when someone
with the username "Direct Kim"

235
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,709
uploads a post on NatePann.

236
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,171
I'm looking for my 16-year-old daughter
who ran away from home.

237
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,967
It's already been two weeks,
and I haven't heard any news.

238
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,137
And what seemed to be a simple
juvenile runaway case at first glance

239
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:12,017
started to head in a completely
unexpected direction at some point…

240
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,647
Moonhole TV's Mystery Battery
is starting now.

241
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,149
All content on this channel is produced

242
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,069
purely with the support
of the subscribers.

243
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:26,657
Subscriptions, likes, and notifications
are always a great help to me.

244
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,369
The police think my child's disappearance
is a simple runaway case.

245
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,706
It seems like they're starting
to get tired of my calls.

246
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,625
I checked my daughter's Internet history.

247
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,879
She searched for pictures
of vacant lots and landscapes.

248
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,131
Traces of entering used goods websites…

249
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,008
-I'm getting too many prank calls.
-Hey.

250
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,885
-I'm going to hand out flyers.
-What is this?

251
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,136
What do you want me to see?

252
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,306
You said you wanted to show me something.
That was your YouTube channel?

253
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,725
Subscribe, like,
and turn on notifications.

254
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,226
…the family is growing weary.

255
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,105
What the heck does this have to do
with my boyfriend's situation?

256
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,107
And what is this person doing here?

257
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,609
I'm the owner here.

258
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,070
And one day…

259
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,990
Hey. Why did you bring me here?

260
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,159
After his last video was uploaded,

261
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,412
Direct Kim's blog posts suddenly stopped.

262
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,208
Captain Price,
can I get a grapefruit soda…

263
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,008
According to an earlier post,

264
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:31,096
he suspected that a church was involved
in his daughter's disappearance

265
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,934
and was making plans
to investigate this church.

266
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,881
MS. HONG, ARE YOU AT HOME?

267
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,720
Too much.

268
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,098
This is too much.

269
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,244
-Who are you?
-Who is it? Is it Jihyo?

270
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,084
Jihyo will be back soon.

271
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,628
My husband has plans with her.

272
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,596
Well, I just need to drop something off
for Ms. Hong.

273
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,931
You're a police officer?

274
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,435
-Yes, sir. I work at Geoan Police--
-No, stay there.

275
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,353
I'll come.

276
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,148
Make yourself at home. Sit.

277
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,027
What department?

278
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,864
The Department of PO.

279
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:12,865
What's PO?

280
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,949
Public Order.

281
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,242
Your phone.

282
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,246
-Sorry?
-Let me see your phone.

283
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,125
I can tell what sort of person you are
by looking at your phone.

284
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,506
Aha, a Korean phone.

285
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,842
You're a pragmatist.

286
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,345
And despite doing rough work,
you refuse to use a phone case?

287
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,347
No, it's not that rough--

288
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,558
You're quite the confident one.

289
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,769
Are you like that with women too?

290
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,854
How did you meet Jihyo?

291
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,899
Yes, well, I met her at the station.

292
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,233
She was on the rooftop…

293
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:49,860
What?

294
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
I mean, what am I saying?

295
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,745
Her boyfriend, Mr. Lee Siguk.

296
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,164
I've met her several times
because of his case.

297
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,165
Siguk?

298
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,459
What's wrong with Siguk?

299
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,295
Did something happen
between Jihyo and Siguk?

300
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,342
May 26, 2018.

301
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,886
Second infiltration attempt footage.

302
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,434
In this seemingly normal building,

303
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,813
the suspicious church
that Kim had been investigating

304
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:30,901
was secretly operating on the top floor,
without so much as a sign.

305
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,822
DIRECT KIM, WHO IS HE?
THE TRUTH BEHIND THE MISSING CASE

306
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,121
The case of Direct Kim's missing daughter?
Was that a thing?

307
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,332
The issue garnered a lot of attention
in UFO communities back then

308
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,918
because alien encounters
are so rare in this country.

309
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,336
I've never heard of it.

310
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,381
There are so many fake stories
on the Internet.

311
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,716
That just shows that you're not legit.

312
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,845
If you are really crazy about UFOs,
you must know about this story.

313
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,141
Oh, welcome, Donghyuk.

314
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,101
What's with her outside?
Why is she so upset?

315
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,186
Aliens took her boyfriend.

316
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,316
Tell me more.

317
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,820
There's a high possibility
that he was kidnapped by a cult

318
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,655
if what that newbie is saying is true.

319
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,657
Moonhole's making
a YouTube video about it.

320
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,785
But do you still have subscribers?

321
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,454
Honestly, I'm not sure about it.

322
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,081
You said you two are friends,

323
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,125
but she just seems
like an attention seeker.

324
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,960
Everything she says sounds like a lie.

325
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,546
She's not lying.

326
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,218
Bora! This is Seoul!

327
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,262
Seoul. I'm sure of it.

328
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,766
SEOUL

329
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,686
Did you get electromagnetic waves
from here? Like an EMP?

330
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,521
It looks fine though.

331
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,192
Lovely Jihyo,
you saw it with your own eyes?

332
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,776
Oh, yes.

333
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,487
But isn't this that…

334
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,406
You know, that…

335
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,450
-Crop circle.
-Crop circle, right!

336
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,535
The thing that appears
where there were UFOs.

337
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,455
But why did you draw this
instead of taking a picture?

338
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,707
Well, I tried to take a picture…

339
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,544
but the bugs ran off.

340
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,462
What bugs?

341
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:19,593
Well, the bugs gathered around
to make the pattern.

342
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,930
It was as if they were responding
to some substance

343
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,265
invisible to the naked eye.

344
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,060
It's aliens!

345
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,311
Come on, man!

346
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,021
Think about what's probable.

347
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,273
It was obviously
those guys from the church.

348
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,984
No, that's even less probable.

349
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,987
What sort of church
uses EMP and controls bugs?

350
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,449
Everyone!
Let's stop this pointless argument.

351
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,702
There's no evidence
for the EMP whatsoever.

352
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,038
We're just being stirred up
by her trolling.

353
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,083
Do you know what an EMP is?
You haven't even gone to the army.

354
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,126
You're actually bringing
the army into this?

355
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,671
-I'm stating facts, dude!
-It's in video games too!

356
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,089
What is it, then? Tell me.

357
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,799
-Do you know?
-What about you, Cap?

358
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,008
-What's an EMP?
-I don't know!

359
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,469
-How would you know?
-Please. Can you be quiet…

360
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,553
Do you even know?

361
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,554
Can you please…

362
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,348
-Stop.
-Sure, I know what an EMP is!

363
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,767
-Quiet!
-What the fuck?

364
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,354
Aliens or cults!

365
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,438
I don't know!

366
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,607
I don't care. That's none of my business!

367
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,485
My boyfriend disappeared.

368
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,488
He's disappeared,
and I saw this at that place!

369
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,117
And Direct or Indirect Kim
saw the same thing.

370
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,160
I need to find that church
or whatever it is.

371
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,121
I need to find it! Why?

372
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,873
Because I need to find
Lee Siguk, that bastard!

373
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
Bora.

374
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:46,305
Is there no way to contact Direct Kim?

375
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,597
There's no way.

376
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,683
It's been a while since he disappeared.

377
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,395
The blog that you saw
is from the data I had backed up.

378
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,898
Then let's try contacting the police
in charge of the case.

379
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,236
Do you think the police will just give out
a civilian's personal information?

380
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,573
Everything you can think of,
I've already tried it.

381
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,950
How long do you think
it took me to make that video?

382
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,205
Then what?

383
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,167
Why did you bring me here?

384
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,710
Why did you show this to me?

385
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
You said these don't even count as clues!

386
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,026
Sign it.

387
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,904
From now on, your boyfriend is my lead.

388
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,824
Direct Kim's bait is too old
for me to investigate,

389
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,410
but what you brought me is still fresh.

390
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,496
Now you guys will become my content.

391
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,497
Sign it.

392
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,293
Wait. What even…

393
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,419
Why should I?

394
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,671
Why? Aren't you going
to find your boyfriend?

395
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,760
No, that's not…

396
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,182
How are you going to investigate?

397
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:17,104
If we all put our noggins together,
something is bound to come up.

398
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,146
Look.

399
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,399
Look at how hard
they're trying to help you.

400
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,192
See?

401
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,880
-Jihyo! Here.
-Okay.

402
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,716
-Sorry I'm late.
-No.

403
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
I didn't wait long. Sit.

404
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,554
The study group went
much longer than I thought.

405
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,764
I thought I'd be able to make it on time.

406
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,307
Why are you coming to this side?

407
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,934
Are you okay with pork jowl?

408
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,103
-We ordered first.
-"We"?

409
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,523
Hong Jihyo.

410
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,067
You're good at being late, aren't you?

411
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,111
-Director.
-Sit.

412
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,030
Don't call me that. We aren't at work.

413
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,032
-Have you rested well?
-Yes.

414
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,703
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

415
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,706
Anyway, your daughter
is really something else, seriously.

416
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,459
-Here, let me.
-She made a client wait for 40 minutes.

417
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,712
There's nothing too hard about work life.

418
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,214
When you've done something wrong,

419
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,299
don't dwell on it.

420
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:31,303
Apologize first,
and quickly correct your mistakes, okay?

421
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,389
Don't do anything like this again.
Please, I'm begging you.

422
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,057
Don't do what?

423
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,478
How long are you going to keep
managing my work life?

424
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
It's not like that.

425
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,649
You were completely dejected for days
over one mistake.

426
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,985
I stepped up
so you guys could talk it out!

427
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,988
Then shouldn't you have
at least told me in advance?

428
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,450
Arguing like this with you
when I'm 30 is just ridiculous.

429
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,161
I'm doing this
because you're acting like a child!

430
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,914
Did you think I wouldn't know
about your study group excuse

431
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,417
and how you're really going
to those weird alien meetings again?

432
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,252
Are you in middle school?

433
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,505
-You went through my desk?
-Hey, you punk.

434
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,467
If your marriage is on the rocks,
you should at least do better at work!

435
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,636
What? Why are you saying that?

436
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,555
I heard you and Siguk broke up.

437
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,349
Where did you hear that?

438
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,101
That cop in Public Order or whatever,

439
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,354
your fling stopped by and told us.

440
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:27,734
How did you end things with him
that made him fly out to another country?

441
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,653
I can't understand you at all.

442
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,154
No, how could I understand?

443
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,658
In my day, the most we ever did
after a breakup was get wasted.

444
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,952
-That's not true.
-What's not true?

445
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,288
That person isn't my fling,
and Siguk didn't fly to another country.

446
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,083
Stop pestering me
if you don't even know anything!

447
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,876
What else could it be?

448
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,546
The cop told me about his bank record
and flight purchase!

449
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,549
That can be fabricated
with a few strokes on the keyboard.

450
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,468
Oh, there you go again
with the weird theories.

451
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,845
Did you learn that at your alien meetings?

452
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,223
I'm not going to alien meetings!

453
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,351
I heard Siguk moved out
all of his stuff in a day.

454
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,937
Did the aliens move that for him too?

455
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,272
No, that's…

456
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,316
Jeez.

457
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,235
Hello, Radioactive Underpants.

458
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,237
Thank you for the 1,000-won donation.

459
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:20,537
I have to use a laptop,
so excuse the bad quality, guys.

460
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,290
We can't play Dead by Daylight all night.

461
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,542
I'm preparing a YouTube video right now.

462
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,462
I'm trying to get the person on board.
You can look forward to this one.

463
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,465
Oh God! That was loud.

464
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,679
Who sent the fucking cat picture?

465
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,639
I told you I hate fucking cats!

466
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,932
Hey, Moonhole.

467
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,562
Hold on a second, guys.

468
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,147
Mom's calling me.

469
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,862
-What?
-Are you not going home?

470
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,114
I don't have a home. I was kicked out.

471
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,951
Then you should look for one.

472
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,829
-I'm streaming right now.
-Then do it during the day.

473
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,165
I can't synthesize my muscles
because you're keeping me up.

474
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,917
Fuck, stop synthesizing your muscles.

475
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,170
Does all the protein in the world
belong to you?

476
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,505
Whatever.

477
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,593
HONG JIHYO

478
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,304
Hey, Jihyo.

479
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,264
Who on earth cleared out the room?

480
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,351
What are you on about?

481
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:28,104
Siguk, I'm talking about Siguk's room.
It was completely cleared out.

482
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,650
Hypothetically speaking,
whether he was kidnapped or not,

483
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,611
if it wasn't Siguk
who cleared out his room,

484
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,739
then who could have done it?

485
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,200
Whoever it was that cleaned the room,

486
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:44,454
isn't that the most direct connection
to his disappearance?

487
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,375
Hello?

488
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,752
I told you, didn't I?

489
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,128
What?

490
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,839
If you use your noggin,
something is bound to come up.

491
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,928
Where is it?

492
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,263
The first scene of my video.

493
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,726
VALUE REAL ESTATE

494
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,103
You'll sign the contract?

495
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,188
Oh, thank you!

496
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,193
Oh, I'm sorry.
You waited long, didn't you?

497
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,739
Are you the person who called me?

498
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,075
REPRESENTATIVE SEO HWAJUNG

499
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,494
-No, I--
-I called you.

500
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,874
Your styles are
total opposites of each other.

501
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,961
You're so cute like a kitty,

502
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,297
and the other is so meek
like a Welsh Corgi.

503
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,718
Is that rude of me?

504
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,386
You're just so cute!

505
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:45,098
Well, we came to Seoul not too long ago,

506
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,100
and we're looking for a studio.

507
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,643
You are going to live together?

508
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,811
Yes.

509
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,814
We'll be living together,
away from our families.

510
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,567
Are you looking into
short-term or long-term?

511
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,819
Is there a studio
you've already looked into?

512
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,655
There is none?

513
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,241
This place is amazing. I'm telling you.

514
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,577
You'll be really surprised. Just wait.

515
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:07,912
I'm serious.

516
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,332
You cuties are really lucky, you know?

517
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,751
You'll be so surprised.

518
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,754
Wow!

519
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,130
See?

520
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
It's totally new.

521
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,258
Wow!

522
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,259
Also…

523
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,262
-It's totally vacant.
-Wow!

524
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,057
You could move in with your stuff today.

525
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,269
-Wow!
-And look at the sash on the window.

526
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,688
-It's brand new.
-Wow!

527
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,523
Take a look!

528
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,275
Hey, this place is really nice.

529
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,237
What do you think? Isn't it clean?

530
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,618
I'm telling you,
your timing coming here was crazy.

531
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,786
Isn't it great?

532
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,245
-Yes!
-You have great taste.

533
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,955
Why is this wallpaper new?

534
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,415
Sorry?

535
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,043
The lighting looks new too.

536
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,961
Why was the interior changed?

537
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,714
Probably because the landlord wanted
to sell the apartment?

538
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,674
What does the landlord do for a living?

539
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,759
Why do you ask?

540
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:09,057
They probably live off monthly rent,
I imagine.

541
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,184
Can you give me their contact information?

542
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,269
What? Why do you want it?

543
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,483
I also need to know the moving company
the past tenant used to move out.

544
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,651
Goodness!

545
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,320
I mean, I don't think I…

546
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,533
I'll look into it.

547
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,409
Thank you.

548
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,376
Your friend must be quite
a meticulous person, isn't she?

549
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,669
I know, right?

550
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,630
She always focuses on weird stuff.

551
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,843
When we hang out together,
people always think I'm the weird one,

552
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,761
but you'll see that I'm the normal one,

553
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,721
and she's the real crazy one

554
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,223
once you get to know us.

555
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,186
You shouldn't say stuff like that!

556
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,938
Oh, my stomach!

557
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,440
Sorry I couldn't show you the house
for too long.

558
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,150
I have other clients waiting.

559
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,569
Oh, that's fine.

560
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,904
Oh my, you're so sweet!

561
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,074
-Take care.
-Okay.

562
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,325
Call me!

563
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,994
I will. Goodbye!

564
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,082
Leave already.

565
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,042
Good.

566
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,588
How I see it,
we need to check with the landlord.

567
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,423
-The moving company--
-Follow me.

568
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,097
Fuck, that's loud.

569
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,348
Hey, what are you doing?

570
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,475
What was it?

571
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,061
I was watching
when she entered the passcode.

572
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,646
Gosh, isn't this illegal?

573
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,141
Hey, hold this.

574
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,810
What is all this?

575
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,966
Film me. What are you doing?

576
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,634
That's what I want to ask you.

577
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,552
What the heck are you looking for?

578
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,554
Narrowband microwave.

579
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,516
What?

580
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,768
Be quiet. I can't hear well.

581
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,563
What on earth are you looking for?

582
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,399
Alien waves.

583
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,567
The same waves
from your boyfriend's watch.

584
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,653
SETI standard
artificial electromagnetic bandwidth.

585
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,779
Don't you know?

586
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,617
Why do I need to know that?

587
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,248
Wow, you're a real idiot, aren't you?

588
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,293
You invented this. Don't you remember?

589
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,462
Everything I'm doing now

590
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,673
are things I learned
from you in middle school.

591
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,074
PHOTOMETER

592
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,043
Oh.

593
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,502
"Oh"?

594
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,880
Moron.

595
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,508
But why are you…

596
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,928
Why are you trying so hard to find them?

597
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,015
You were never interested in that stuff.

598
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:22,226
I was the otaku,
and you were just a delinquent.

599
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,605
Fuck. You and that mouth of yours.

600
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,690
-Hey!
-What?

601
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,359
-Don't you want to find your boyfriend?
-I want to.

602
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,029
But what does that have to do with this?

603
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,656
Why did you become such a fucking idiot?

604
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,742
Why can't you say what's in your head?

605
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
-What's in my head?
-Repeat after me.

606
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,372
Aliens abducted my boyfriend.

607
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,585
Say it.

608
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,046
Aliens abducted my boyfriend.

609
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,181
Google it.

610
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,267
-He said he met a girl.
-Oh my!

611
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,189
Google it.

612
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,170
-Wow, it looks so nice.
-I still can't find the lights.

613
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,965
Wow, it's nice and cozy, isn't it?

614
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,883
Welcome!

615
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,804
Sister Seo,
how much does the rent go for here?

616
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,348
Brother Han, are you planning
on investing in real estate?

617
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:46,644
Should I give you
all the housing information?

618
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:50,106
Come on.
Real estate's your thing, Sister Seo.

619
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,192
Once I get married,
I want to start out in a place like this.

620
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,863
Don't you feel a draft
coming in from somewhere?

621
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,240
-Is it from upstairs?
-What?

622
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,868
Well, I'm not so sure.

623
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,327
Is it?

624
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,831
Sister Seo. Can I go up?

625
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,583
-Of course.
-Hey!

626
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,751
Go that way.

627
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,128
Okay!

628
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,340
-Oh, this is the bathroom?
-Sister Back.

629
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,967
Mind the stairs.

630
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,845
Wow, the loft is nice.

631
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,080
-I can't!
-Go!

632
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,042
Wait!

633
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,505
Hurry!

634
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,979
Look at this space.

635
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,024
It's actually nice here.

636
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,653
Jeez.

637
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,488
-Sister Back.
-Yes?

638
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,531
Are you done looking around?

639
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:26,452
-Shall we start now?
-Yes, sure.

640
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,272
What is it?

641
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,743
Clean in flesh.

642
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,745
-And clean in spirit.
-And clean in spirit.

643
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:56,792
May you teach, rebuke, correct,
and train us in righteousness.

644
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,754
-Sella!
-Sella!

645
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,590
-You have shown us the truth…
-For the sins of our past lives…

646
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,926
Give us the courage to take down
the tents of ignorant souls.

647
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,971
May you spread your true love on the paths
that lead to the road of truth,

648
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,015
which transcends all cleansing.

649
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,433
-Sella.
-Sella.

650
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,435
Give us the courage
to take down the tents…

651
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,437
-…firm promise to you.
-…forever.

652
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,608
Please forgive the wickedness of those
who are not clean in flesh and spirit.

653
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,571
-Sella.
-Sella.

654
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,158
Clean in flesh.

655
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,285
-And clean in spirit.
-And clean in spirit.

656
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,373
You are the Light in the darkness.

657
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,376
May your Light be used

658
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:43,047
for teaching, rebuking, correcting,
and training in righteousness.

659
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,300
We lift up a firm promise to you.

660
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,638
May you come to us in our sleep,
lead us in our sleep…

661
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,391
-Dear Light!
-Dear Light!

662
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,061
We will escape this prison

663
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:02,233
and move forward on a path
of ascension and unity!

664
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:09,156
-Sella!
-Sella!

665
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,240
