00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,927
According to a 1992 poll
conducted in the United States,

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,096
about 2% of adult men and women

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,558
claimed to have had contact
with beings from other worlds.

MAY 2007

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,656
If we were to expand this study
to the global population,

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,951
more than 100 million people
have come into contact with aliens

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,119
over the past few decades.

8
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:41,875
J. Allen Hynek classified these contacts
into four "close encounters."

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,796
The fourth type occurs mainly
in a state of hypnagogia.

10
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,426
Hypnagogia is a kind of trance,
a so-called lucid dreaming state

11
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,929
that is described
as being paralyzed by sleep.

THE ALIEN KIDNAPPING
1961 KIDNAPPING OF THE HILLS

14
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,647
Simply put, if you fall into hypnagogia,
you can meet aliens.

MATH 1ST SEMESTER SAMPLE QUESTIONS

16
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,908
Anyone can achieve hypnagogia
through training.

17
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,417
In the state of lucid dreaming,

18
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:29,506
you will be able to meet
your unconscious mind.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,343
After lying down,

20
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:39,099
focus on my words
and feel them in your mind.

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,771
Relax your body in a comfortable position.

22
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,358
Take deep breaths,

23
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,529
and let go of all your worries.

It won't be easy.

26
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,122
The score is eight to two!

27
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,708
Yes, just before the game, I…

28
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,676
Commentator Park Seung-ho's…

29
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,846
A hit to left field! It's out of the park!

30
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,015
-A two-run blast from Hyundai!
-Yes.

31
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,808
The score is eight to two.

32
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,937
It's not over.

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,691
There are many issues
to overcome going forward.

34
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,194
Hyundai should finish the season well…

THE ATTEMPTED SHOOT DOWN OF A UFO IN SEOUL

37
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,256
You're in my class, right?

38
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,344
Hey!

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,812
What's that about?

40
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,734
-What do you mean?
-What is it?

41
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,986
Who went missing?

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,405
It's nothing.

43
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,074
It's just some weird stuff.

44
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,369
Something about a UFO in Seoul…

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,536
What's that?

46
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,122
I've never heard about that before.

47
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,958
Do they really exist?

48
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
Are UFOs real?

49
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:19,259
HONG JIHYO

51
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,645
want to read it?

52
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,667
Dad, I told you I don't need an air fryer.

53
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,586
We don't even cook at home.

54
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,006
Siguk…

55
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,174
Siguk can't cook either.

56
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,344
Anyway, Dad, don't order us one.

57
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,512
Don't, okay?

58
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,680
Yeah.

59
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,891
Yes. Okay, bye!

REAL WOMEN

61
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,190
What's everyone doing today?

62
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,861
If you're free after work,
do you want to meet?

63
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,079
Hello?

64
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,497
Yes, hello!

65
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,583
Am I speaking to Ms. Hong Jihyo?

66
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,669
I'm Seo Hwajung from Value Real Estate.

67
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,714
Sorry? Where did you say you're from?

68
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,674
The real estate office.

69
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,009
Sorry to bother you,

70
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:48,181
but you are an acquaintance
of Mr. Lee Siguk, right?

71
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,516
Yes, but why?

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,103
Mr. Lee hasn't paid his rent this month,

73
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,938
so I got a call from the landlord!

74
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,691
But I think he's very busy or something.

75
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,528
I haven't been able to get a hold of him,
so I called his emergency contact.

76
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,989
What are you saying?
Can you go a little slower?

77
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,326
Mr. Lee hasn't been answering my calls
for a few days now!

78
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,661
I'm not trying to rush him or anything,

79
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,081
but he usually pays right on time,

80
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,958
and he didn't do so this month.

81
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,546
Is he with you right now?

82
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,466
He has not answered your calls for days?

83
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,144
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

Thirty years old.

00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,346
Why do you believe he's missing?

106
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:22,348
You can't contact him?

107
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,850
No. It's been a whole week.

108
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,355
I called his work,
and they told me he hasn't come in.

109
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:33,109
Also, no one else has been able
to contact him either.

110
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,360
Anything else?

111
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,112
-Good evening.
-Is there anything else?

112
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,239
Evidence or something.

113
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,449
Oh!

114
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,454
Here.

115
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,539
Look at this.

116
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,306
Isn't it strange?

117
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,101
Ma'am, this side, please.

118
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,940
-Jeez…
-Oh?

119
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,401
The rooftop lady.

120
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,824
Reporting an adult as a missing person
is not that easy to do.

121
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,117
If you're not family,

122
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,328
you can't even submit
a missing person report.

123
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,581
We were basically engaged to each other.

124
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,249
But you said you broke up.

125
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,545
Damn it. This stupid thing.

126
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,838
Is it broken?

127
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,851
No, take it.

128
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,524
Hypothetically speaking,

129
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,152
what if he's in trouble?

130
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,446
Don't we need to move faster on this?

131
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,782
There's a possibility
something could've happened.

132
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,200
Trouble? Like what?

133
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,159
You know,

134
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,661
he could've gotten into a fight,
gotten injured,

135
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,747
died, and got buried.

136
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,166
Is there anything we can do
in this situation?

137
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,340
It gives me a headache too.

138
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,428
By our rules, adult males
aren't subject to investigation.

139
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,721
How can that be a rule?

140
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,142
Ms. Hong, please don't get too angry…

141
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,977
I'm not angry.

142
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,650
Ms. Hong.

143
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,570
You really can't know
what's going on in others' minds.

144
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,533
As a cop, I've seen several
missing person cases come through.

145
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,411
People you'd never expect to flip out

146
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,581
disappear for months
and then come back like nothing happened.

147
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,417
It's more common than you think.

148
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,838
You also went to some strange place
and ended up at the police station.

149
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,130
And you're perfectly normal.

150
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,847
Anyway,

151
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,017
I'll call if anything comes up.
Go home for now.

152
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,021
And don't be too worried
about it either, okay?

153
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,817
You want me to take a look at this?
I'm good at fixing things.

154
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:37,960
This is the moment where the ironclad skin
and scales of the sturgeon shine.

155
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,507
Above all… so that they can fully grow…

156
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,806
Their name is "Save the Copra."

157
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,562
What is threatening the sturgeons
that live at the bottom of their habitat

158
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,148
is not the other animals but old nets…

159
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:07,156
Their job is to save the sturgeons
that are dying in nets.

170
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,201
They testified that
electronic devices stopped working…"

171
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
"The devices emitted a pulsing noise.

172
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,961
These claims have not been
scientifically proven.

"You've already met an alien"?

Hello, Moonhole.

187
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,140
I can't think of another way to reach you,
so please excuse me for leaving a comment.

188
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,350
Not long ago, my boyfriend went missing.

189
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes, it's strange for me to ask you this
when we don't even know each other.

190
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,398
-I'm really sorry, but--
-Jihyo!

191
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,069
I heard you and Siguk broke up.

192
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,656
Um, yeah.

193
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,657
Gosh!

194
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,786
Why did you tell Miju but not me?

195
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,038
Shouldn't you be telling me
these things first?

196
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,876
We were just on the phone together,
and she kind of led me into it…

197
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:09,046
When did you break up?
Why did he want to break up?

198
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,047
Is he crazy?

199
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,509
-I broke up with him.
-Ms. Oh.

200
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,428
I'm coming, sir.

201
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,890
Pick up when I call you.

202
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,287
"Are the mods still meeting up?"

203
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,167

00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,880
"They do that shit every week.
Saturdays at 1:00 p.m."

205
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,552
Saturday, 1:00 p.m.?

206
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,140
Saturday, 1:00 p.m…

207
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,307
I'm not sure.

208
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,818
Try it again now.

209
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,486
Check.

210
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,283
It's working.

211
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,285
Great work, Donghyuk.

212
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,788
We can hear you fine.
Why do you need to use the mic every time?

213
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,457
It's about time,
so I'll start calling attendance.

214
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,377
Captain Price is here, of course.
Donghyuk is here.

215
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,297
What's with the roll call?
Only the regulars are here anyway.

216
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,465
There's a new name on the list.

217
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
So I'm trying to be formal.

218
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,220
They paid the fee,
but I don't think they came.

219
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,307
The anonymous users are talking
about how we're too close.

220
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,184
You must know how sensitive things are.

221
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,478
Let's not call each other by name
just because this is offline.

222
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,689
You literally called me Donghyuk earlier.

223
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,608
Why don't you call me by my nickname?

224
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,652
What kind of nickname
is Mission Lymphadenitis?

225
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,906
That's hate speech.

226
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,284
How is that hate speech?
Everything is hate speech to you!

227
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,496
How do you think people with lymphadenitis
would feel if they heard that?

228
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,833
Donghyuk, think a little deeper.

229
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,751
Yeah.

230
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,669
Donghyuk, think first.

00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,167
Thank you.

234
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,199

235
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,293
Do you live in this area?

236
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,378
Sorry?

237
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,799
Well, I live around here,
and I've never seen your face before.

238
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,551
Oh.

239
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,553
No.

240
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,390
Then what brings you here?

241
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,770
I just had a quick errand here.

242
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,980
What errand?

243
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,984
Oh, that?

246
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,371
People still do offline meetings nowadays.
How interesting.

247
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,248
Right.

248
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,543
This is my first time
seeing it in real life.

249
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,796
Do you like those sorts of things?

250
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,214
Sorry?

251
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,178
You know, aliens, UFOs, things like that?

252
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,387
No!

253
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,141
Then why did you come?

254
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,437
Touché.

255
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,689
Well,

256
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:44,613
I normally really hate those things.
I hate baseless things like that.

257
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,577
And I don't like ridiculous,
otaku-like stuff.

258
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,247
So I really don't know why I came here.

259
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,676
Oh, thank you

260
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,637
for the light.

261
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:24,194
Humankind lives on a planet called Earth
in the middle of a vast universe.

262
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,907
Could there be another higher life form
in the universe like mankind?

263
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:35,038
According to world-renowned scientists,
the existence of higher alien life groups,

264
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:40,877
such as human civilization, is natural
given the size and age of the universe.

265
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,380
Furthermore,

266
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,551
they believe that if aliens exist,
there would be pioneering civilizations

267
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:51,138
that existed
long before human civilizations did.

268
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:56,101
Scientists also believe
they may have already visited Earth.

269
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,982
We have always been curious
about the possibility of aliens.

270
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,529
We have sifted through many cases
to find proof of their existence.

271
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,614
Meanwhile,

272
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:14,286
it was also revealed
that the US Central Intelligence Agency

273
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,204
was questioning their existence as well.

274
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,914
So…

275
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,352
Lovely Jihyo?

276
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,563
-Yes.
-I've never seen you.

277
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,899
-When did you make your account?
-Yesterday.

278
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,525
What? A total newbie?

279
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,069
A newbie at our forum gathering?

280
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,572
Lovely Jihyo, did you read
the forum announcements?

281
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,199
Yeah, kind of.

282
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,451
It's a bit late,
but can I change my nickname?

283
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,288
You can't post about this on the forum.
And please use everyone's nicknames.

284
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,748
My name is Cho Phillip.

285
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,874
Captain Price.

286
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,335
And Donghyuk. And…

287
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,504
Skip the lame-ass introduction, dude.

288
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,589
Anyway,

289
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,509
welcome, Lovely Jihyo!

290
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,094
Welcome, Lovely Jihyo.

291
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,612
It's deep in the night.

292
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,157
Now, I will choose one person
to be the mafia.

293
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,454
All right. The mafia has been chosen.

294
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,290
It's morning now.
Participants, please raise your heads.

295
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:49,714
The citizens must try to deduce
who the mafia is through open discussion.

296
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,049
Good luck.

297
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,972
Hey, don't you think playing the game
with four people is wrong?

298
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,391
Is the game balanced?
There's only one mafia.

299
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,392
Oh?

300
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,520
-Captain Price is being suspicious, eh?
-What are you talking about?

301
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,772
You said something
only the mafia can relate to.

302
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,482
-So obvious, eh?
-I'm sorry to--

303
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,734
You run your mouth
every chance you get, huh?

304
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,319
Play a lot of Among Us lately?

305
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,737
I'm sorry to interrupt, but--

306
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,990
You mad, eh?
I hit the nail on the head, eh?

307
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,909
You're making me look like the mafia.
That's more suspicious.

308
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,620
Can I ask a question?
I really don't have much time--

309
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,455
Hey, everyone!

310
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,210
The mafia was picked randomly,
so don't get any wrong ideas.

311
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,962
Besides these two,

312
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,550
please point out
who you think the mafia is.

313
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,551
Her.

314
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,887
The reason for your decision is…

315
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,349
She looks like a damn good liar!

316
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,143
Huh? Me?

317
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,603
What…

318
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,648
What's your MBTI type?

319
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,487
Don't say it. Let me guess.

320
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,783
INFJ.

321
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,327
Right?

322
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,999
You're right, but…

323
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,002
INFJs are like that.
They're freakin' backstabbers.

324
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,587
How should I put it?

325
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,341
Two-faced, how about that?

326
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,093
You know what I mean?

327
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:21,264
You pretend to be a normal person
and considerate of others,

328
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,933
but on the inside, you judge them.

329
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,852
Always waiting to cut people out.

330
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,271
I hate those types!

331
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,108
Wait, I, what?

332
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,903
You were dissing us outside earlier.

333
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,531
Saying how we smell like fucking otakus.

334
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,826
Whoa…

335
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,330
No, I didn't say it like that--

336
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,374
You look like you have a boyfriend too.

337
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,250
I feel bad for him.

338
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,171
I'm sure you'll cut him out someday.

339
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,636
What are you trying to do?

340
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,598
I fucking hate you.

341
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,729
What's wrong with her?

342
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,065
-Where are you going?
-Damn it.

343
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,444
Wow.

344
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,030
Wow, what kind of…

345
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:19,989
What a jerk.

346
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,241
Hey!

347
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,256
Damn it!

348
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,173
Hey!

349
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,466
Hey, wait a second!

350
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,427
I need to ask you… Hey!

351
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,554
Hey!

352
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,807
So, who was the mafia?

353
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,854
Hey!

354
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,858
Excuse me!

355
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,360
What was that person's nickname?

356
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,611
-Who?
-That girl.

357
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,947
-You mean Moonhole?
-That was Moonhole?

358
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,783
We're going to play LOL.
Do you want to come? A team of four?

359
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,786
No need to force yourself
to play with smelly otakus.

360
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,704
Lovely…

361
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,622
Whatever, see you on the forum.

362
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,040
Socializing is not allowed.

363
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,043
The meeting starts in 15 minutes.
You're on your way, right?

364
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,837
-Don't be late.
-I'll get there first.

365
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,006
-Run, it will be crowded!
-Let's go!

366
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
Dibs on the top lane!

367
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,096
The green light is on. You may now cross.

368
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,487
What the hell?

369
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,722
Oh shit!

370
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,693
Shoot!

371
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,492
Darn it!

372
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:55,979
Shit!

373
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,727
MR. EOM

374
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,646
Hello, Mr. Eom.

375
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,983
The thing is…

376
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,988
I have an emergency right now.

377
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,781
I'm sorry.

378
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,161
I'll catch a taxi and get there in 20--
No, in ten minutes.

379
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm sorry.

380
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,764
Dang.

381
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,447
-Did you check your guest book?
-Oh fuck!

382
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,911
Did you see
the comment I left on your page?

383
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,665
I don't know.
I haven't been on the forums.

384
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,707
Let me go.

385
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,338
I'm sorry, but I can't.
I have no time, so I'll just ask you.

386
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,548
What are you doing?

387
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,342
What is this?

388
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,927
Where did you get this?

389
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,472
Where did you get it?

390
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,641
You didn't draw this yourself, did you?

391
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,643
Are you an idiot?

392
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,104
-What did you say--
-You're the one who drew it.

393
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,857
The attempted shoot down
of a UFO in Seoul, 1976.

394
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,319
Back Yoonsun, Korea's first alien contact.

395
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,738
You don't remember me?

396
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,873
I'm going to tell everyone!

397
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,551
Awesome.

398
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,430
Hey, this is crazy!

399
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,145
You can't tell anyone about this place.

400
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,773
It'd be awesome to hide alcohol
in here and drink, right?

401
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,818
This isn't the place for that.
It's an observatory.

402
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,278
-Whatever.
-You watch stars.

403
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,155
-And observe natural phenomena.
-Yeah.

404
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,740
It's perfect now.

405
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,787
So, did you draw it?

406
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,330
Yeah.

407
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,957
I sort of drew it.

408
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,299
Let me see.

409
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,223
What do you think?

410
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,808
'76 SEOUL UFO INCIDENT
GRAY REPRODUCTION

411
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,478
You're a shitty artist.

412
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
I'm looking at it.

413
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,778
Hey, Jihyo.

414
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,946
Do you have a green pen?

415
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,741
Pen?

416
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,928
This came from your stupid brain.

417
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,264
All I did was draw the helmet.

418
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,017
Do you not remember at all?

419
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,646
Hey!

420
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,194
Fucking hell.

421
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,871
Just when my insurance runs out,
this piece of shit breaks.

422
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,082
Huh Bora?

423
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,544
You.

424
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,631
You are the person in that forum…

425
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,883
That person is you?

426
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,302
And here I thought
you came looking for me.

427
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,221
What the hell are you talking about?

428
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,267
Huh Bora?
Is she the friend you mentioned before?

429
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,102
The one you hung out with in that van?

430
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,271
Yeah.

431
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,439
I did have a friend,

432
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,442
but she wasn't really a good friend.

433
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,029
She was… Anyway, that's what she was like.

434
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,364
A delinquent.

435
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,366
She drank too.

436
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,662
After that, I didn't hang out with her.
It was the first time in a long time.

437
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,165
But why the Unicorns?

438
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,375
The Unicorns Alien.

439
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,751
The Unicorns.

440
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,128
What?

441
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,090
The Unicorns.

442
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,091
All right.

443
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,051
So you gained something at least.

444
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,220
You solved one thing
you were so curious about.

445
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,388
The darn Unicorns.

446
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,183
I guess you're sort of amazing in a way.

447
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,852
You're the first that I've seen
in this line of work

448
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,938
to do something to find out
about symbols from delusions.

449
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,440
Unicorns!

450
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,027
-What the hell is she doing by herself?
-Unicorns.

451
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,739
Yes, Mr. Eom.

452
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,117
Yes, sir.

453
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,536
Yes.

454
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,748
-Ms. Hong.
-Yes.

455
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,750
Director.

456
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,962
You have some nerve
keeping the client waiting for 40 minutes.

457
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,132
I will take responsibility for this
however I can.

458
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,178
Take responsibility? How?

459
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,517
To take responsibility,

460
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,646
you must be in a position to do so!

461
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,148
Are you in such a position?

462
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,691
No!

463
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,318
Then who has to do it?

464
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,278
I have to! Me!

465
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,115
You know,

466
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,202
I really liked the way you worked.

467
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,787
You never missed work.

468
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,706
You took things head-on,
not like the kids these days.

469
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,542
I thought you wouldn't bring
your personal issues to work.

470
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,091
I heard you broke up
with your boyfriend recently.

471
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,596
Where in the world did he hear that from?

472
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,362
Was it bad?

473
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,489
It was definitely from Oh Sehee.

474
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,032
She's the one who told him.

475
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,617
She's the only one who would.

476
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,704
You don't know that.
It could have been your father.

477
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,621
Oh!

478
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,415
You know what?

479
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,836
I mean, where the hell is that bastard?
Why hasn't he contacted me yet?

480
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,671
That bastard? Which bastard?

481
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,465
Siguk, obviously.

482
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,014
Did I not tell you?

483
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,976
Hey, did you forget to tell me
something important again?

484
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,716
Oh my!

485
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,304
-Who are you?
-Did you come for the open house?

486
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,972
What?

487
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,891
Did you have an appointment with me?

488
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,642
I'm a little out of it right now.

489
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,186
What are you talking about?

490
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,729
What?

491
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,524
Hey, excuse me.

492
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,208
-Where is everything?
-What do you mean?

493
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,170
The guy who used to live here
and his things, where are they?

494
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,923
The tenant took all his stuff
before he left.

495
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,674
-When?
-Huh?

496
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,179
-Was it two days ago?
-Did you see him yourself?

497
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:53,015
Hey, who are you, and why are you asking?

498
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,767
Do you know the previous tenant?

499
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,145
-Is there a problem here?
-No. Nothing to worry about!

500
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,192
Hello?

501
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,694
Ms. Hong. This is Officer Kim Byungjo.

502
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,155
We have Mr. Lee's banking details.

503
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,659
Moving fee, house rental deposit return,
used car shop,

504
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,037
and the most recent transaction
was made at 4:20 a.m. to Sky Air.

505
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,498
That one's a payment for a flight.

506
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,085
It doesn't show the destination,
but based on the price,

507
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,088
I think he went somewhere overseas.

508
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:26,841
Hello?

509
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,260
Hello, Ms. Hong? Are you listening?

510
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,761
Ms. Hong.

511
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,138
Hello?

512
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,087
Rescued sturgeons are given a safe tag

513
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,506
before they return to the wild.

514
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,467
Maybe new life…

515
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,243
Ms. Hong, let's go for a cigarette.

516
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,956
Ms. Oh, did Ms. Hong leave?

517
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,376
Oh, Jihyo took a leave of absence.

518
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,004
That's not like her.

519
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,297
She must be very sick.

520
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,592
She's not sick. She's heartbroken.

521
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:55,804
-Heartbroken? What are you talking about?
-You didn't hear the news?

522
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,264
No, what is it?

523
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,017
It's about Jihyo's boyfriend.

524
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,644
Why, what happened?

525
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,301
I've been giving you space for four years.

526
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,264
How much longer do I need to do that?

527
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,714
What?

528
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,331
What in the world…

529
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,749
What is all this?

530
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,932
Wait…

531
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,100
Wait a minute.

532
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:27,576
