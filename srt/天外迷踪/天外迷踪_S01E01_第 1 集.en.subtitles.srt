MATH 1ST SEMESTER SAMPLE QUESTIONS
HONG JIHYO

3
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,058
This is Hong Jihyo.

4
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,310
Hong Jihyo is rational.

5
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,520
Hong Jihyo is sensible.

6
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,733
Hong Jihyo does not believe in anything
that has no scientific substance.

7
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,195
Just because I can see it
doesn't mean I should believe it.

8
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
The only thing
I need to believe in is myself.

9
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,033
When I open my eyes,

10
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,869
I'll be in a world
where lies and truths coexist.

11
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,818
Shall we begin learning
English expressions?

12
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,279
Listen to the sentences and repeat.

13
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,824
You have a long road ahead of you.

14
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,790
I am planning for a trip this weekend.

15
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,339
Your journey will take you very far.

16
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,515
How long are you planning to go away?

17
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,238
Let's go eat.

18
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,991
Let me work on this a little longer.

19
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,201
Come on. It's lunchtime now!

20
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,330
It isn't for another ten minutes though.

21
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,332
Let's just eat first!

22
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,833
We work to eat, not eat to--

23
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,751
Ms. Oh.

24
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,002
-Yes?
-Let's order food.

25
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,045
Okay!

26
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,713
See? I told you so.

27
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,548
What should we order, sir?

28
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,675
-Whatever you'd like!
-Okay!

29
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,634
What do you want?

30
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,846
-Healthy food.
-Yeah.

31
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,014
Healthy food…

32
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:54,312
I'm sorry to disturb you during lunch.
I couldn't find better timing.

33
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,397
-Here.
-What is it?

34
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,398
Some pocket money?

35
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,150
-What is this?
-No.

36
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,485
I'm getting married.

37
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,489
Congrats. No wonder you go home early
from company dinners.

38
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,948
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

39
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,869
But aren't you in your mid-twenties?
You're already getting married?

40
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,621
What do you mean "already"?

41
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,123
If it were the old days,
she'd already have a child.

42
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,126
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

43
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,961
-Thank you.
-So she's getting married.

44
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,217
She seems like an adult
now that she's getting married.

45
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,635
-Ms. Hong.
-Yes?

46
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,804
You're an adult too, you know?

47
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,640
Am I?

48
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,893
She must have gotten pregnant.

49
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,897
If not, why would they be getting married
after just three months?

50
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,690
No way.

51
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,568
Really? Then is she becoming
a mother right away?

52
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
You know Misun, right?

53
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,447
She transferred when we were sophomores.

54
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,367
-Her kid started school this year.
-Seriously?

55
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,661
Wow, I can't believe it.

56
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,164
You have Siguk though.
What's there to worry about?

57
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,749
What's he got to do with this?

58
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,585
-Aren't you going to marry him?
-Huh?

59
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,671
Yeah, well…

60
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,258
All settled, then!
You have nothing to worry about.

61
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,721
Everyone's living their best lives,
and all I'm doing is getting older.

62
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,393
I really need to get it together.

63
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,245
Gosh.

64
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,165
Damn it.

65
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,556
Oops.

66
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,440
Ah, that scared me.

67
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,734
How long has it been?

68
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,904
Three years? Four?

69
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,157
Wait, I think this is the first time
they've come so close.

70
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,910
Okay, let's stay calm, Hong Jihyo.

71
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,411
Stay calm.

72
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,041
-Do you have a discount or a loyalty card?
-No.

73
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,209
Would you like a bag?

74
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,460
Yes, please.

75
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,003
That'll be 13,200 won.

76
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,379
Ah, okay.

77
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,092
Thank you. Come again.

78
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,231
Not everything I see is important.

79
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,983
Don't believe anything, Hong Jihyo.

80
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,364
Not everything I see is important.

81
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,283
Just because I can see it
doesn't mean I should believe it.

82
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,410
The only thing
I need to believe in is myself.

83
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,956
That's how I get through another day.

84
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,753
Today's sentences. Listen and repeat.

85
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,964
How can I help you?

86
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,882
Is there something else
you're looking for?

87
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,302
Good morning, Mr. Park.

88
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,471
Ms. Oh. Hiya, good morning!

89
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,056
Hey, Sehee.

90
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,601
Good morning, my ass.

91
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,645
I'm exhausted already.

92
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,523
Are you wearing contacts?

93
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,943
Let's go for drinks later, Jihyo.

94
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,111
Tomorrow's Saturday.

95
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,613
Sure, I'll go with you. You can drink.

96
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,865
You won't even have one drink again?

97
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,952
What I hate about drinking is that…

98
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,204
It impairs your mind, I know.

99
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,290
I don't get you.

100
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,085
For me, I want my mind impaired
every second of the day.

101
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,714
I want to get off work already.

102
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,175
Ah, I don't want to go back to work!

103
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,802
Don't talk about work.

104
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,513
I'm in a good mood
since I got my ID checked today.

105
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,933
Why am I such a loser?

106
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,228
Miju, you never think that?

107
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,855
You're just a hair loss nurse.

108
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,899
Not a hair loss nurse.
I'm a hair follicle separator, girl.

109
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,943
What about you, Jihyo?

110
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,614
What are you doing, Jihyo?
I'm talking to you.

111
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,865
Who are you messaging?

112
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,617
Siguk?

113
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,368
No, I'm talking to Mr. Eom.

114
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,662
Mr. Eom? Why?

115
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,167
He's having trouble installing V-Ray.
I'm teaching him how.

116
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,210
All done. What were you saying?

117
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,047
Jihyo.

118
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,341
Why are you so cool?

119
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,217
Gosh, she's starting this again.

120
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,677
I'm sick and tired of it.

121
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,017
I wish I were born as Hong Jihyo.

122
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,102
She has a great body, a pretty face,

123
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,688
and a daddy who is friends
with the company director.

124
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,607
Cheers to nepotism!

125
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,610
And she has a boyfriend that she'll marry.

126
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,655
Her mom's business
is super successful, damn it.

127
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,323
Why are you so invincible?

128
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,409
My stepmom, not my mom.

129
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,416
Why is everything so easy for you, huh?

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,255
Ah, I wish my life
was all sorted like Jihyo's is.

131
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,052
Dad got me a job.

132
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,014
I have a successful stepmother
and a boyfriend I can marry.

133
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,559
Yeah. I do have an easy life.

134
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,944
Right, there's nothing wrong.

135
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,405
I can live like everyone else.

136
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,173
Swing!

137
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,883
Strikeout.

138
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,052
That's the end of the game.

139
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
Hyundai Unicorns win, two-nil.

140
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,890
And just like that,
a nine-inning game comes to a close.

141
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,642
Now, Suwon's Hyundai Unicorns

142
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:11,355
will be leaving the stage
of professional baseball

143
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,983
after 12 years of history. However…

144
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,335
Shall we throw it or not?
Shall we throw it or not?

145
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,006
Th, th, th, th… Throw! Throw!

146
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,342
Shall we throw it or not?
Shall we throw it or not?

147
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,929
Th, th, th, th… Throw! Throw!

148
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,931
You may have heard whispers in your heart.

149
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,893
-What's going on?
-It tells you to close your eyes.

150
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,564
To avoid reality
to preserve your peace of mind.

151
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,399
-Throw!
-Throw! Throw!

152
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,234
That's not a truthful life.

153
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,445
The truth is right in front of your eyes.

154
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,615
You can't turn a blind eye to it
and deny it forever.

155
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,950
It puts its head to the ground,
thinking it's hidden.

156
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,953
You have made a cowardly choice.

157
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,706
By taking advantage of the fact
that humans are creatures of oblivion,

158
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,666
you've chosen to avoid the situation.

159
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm watching you.

160
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:22,259
I'm watching you.

161
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,547
Well, this is something new.

162
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,382
That's all it is.

163
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,275
But there's just one thing
that's bothering me.

164
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,944
Swing! Strikeout.

165
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,655
That's the end of the game.

166
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,242
Hyundai Unicorns win, two-nil.
And like that, a nine-inning game…

167
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,452
Why?

168
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,163
Now, Suwon's Hyundai Unicorns
will be leaving the stage…

169
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,080
Why?

170
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,540
SIGUK

171
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,584
Why?

172
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,919
…after 12 years of history…

173
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,922
Why, of all things, was it the Unicorns?

174
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,842
…we will always remember
this glorious team.

175
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,971
Fans aren't leaving the stadium,
choosing to stay as the Hyundai players…

176
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,515
What?

177
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,559
Hey!

178
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,144
Oh dear!

179
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,563
Hope your teeth are still there. You okay?

180
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,859
Are you catching a cold?

181
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,445
Are you okay?

182
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,882
HYUNDAI UNICORNS

183
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,552
HYUNDAI UNICORNS
KBO LEAGUE - DISBANDED TEAM

184
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,888
Then I asked him.

185
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,184
"Why do you only have loft apartments?"

186
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,353
"Are there any two-room houses
in Hongdae?"

187
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,690
He answers, "You don't have
the sensibility of a young person."

188
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,858
"Just buy the loft. It's got a vibe."

189
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,403
He doesn't get the vibe
of the word "vibe," right?

190
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
Young people don't have sensibilities.

191
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,324
If I had the money,
I wouldn't be looking for a two-room--

192
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
Do you watch pro baseball?

193
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,912
-What?
-Do you like pro baseball?

194
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,497
Out of the blue?

195
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,833
Is there a team you like?

196
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,920
Do you know how many people die
in ball accidents each year?

197
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,840
Have you ever talked to me
about baseball before?

198
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,635
I mean, something that could have slipped
into my subconscious.

199
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,096
Like a team that got disbanded?

200
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,892
I've never slipped anything
into your subconscious.

201
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,398
Fine.

202
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,066
What is it this time?

203
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,194
It's nothing.

204
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,196
-Then I'll finish what I was saying.
-Okay.

205
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,450
A two-bedroom…

206
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,078
You killed the vibe.

207
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,080
Never mind. Hey, look.

208
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,833
You know what? Take a look at this.

209
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,757
What is this?

210
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,133
A house.

211
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,469
-What house?
-Our house.

212
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,345
Why do we have a house?

213
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,264
The rental house for young adults.

214
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,725
I got it!

215
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,312
Oh…

216
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,646
-What?
-A house.

217
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,316
I landed us a house in this economy!

218
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,031
Oh, yeah.

219
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,658
Oh, yeah?

220
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,576
Are you not happy?

221
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,828
I am.

222
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,915
That's great. Good job.

223
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,083
Great?

224
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,045
Then are we moving in together now?

225
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,965
Yeah.

226
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,679
Let's face them!

227
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,223
Who?

228
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,894
Sturgeon is a very ancient fish

229
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,980
that has existed on Earth
since the Cretaceous period.

230
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,526
Sturgeon, also known as living fossils,

231
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,445
are one of the few animals
that maintain an outward appearance

232
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,615
that is similar to their ancestors
from 170 million years ago.

233
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,161
Sturgeon are carnivorous
but have no teeth,

234
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,413
so they sweep the area underwater…

235
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,792
So,

236
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,003
do you two have time this weekend?

237
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,258
Siguk would like to treat us to a meal.

238
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,761
But why?

239
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
I guess he has something to say.

240
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,601
Did he propose to you?

241
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,775
Your father and I have time this weekend.

242
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,736
Tell us the time and place,
and we'll be there.

243
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,698
Okay.

244
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,833
Wow, it's finally done!

245
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,753
I worried she'd never be able
to live like a normal person.

246
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,590
-Thank goodness, really.
-All right, calm down.

247
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,383
Why are you making such a fuss?

248
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,428
As long as she can live
like everyone else,

249
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,346
I don't ask for much!

250
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,935
Is this how it should go?

251
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,022
Graduate, find a job,

252
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,940
get married, have a baby,

253
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,609
live like everyone else,

254
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,778
and ignore the weird things
I sometimes see?

255
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,363
Isn't that right, Jihyo?

256
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,531
Right?

257
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,284
What?

258
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,412
Back in middle school,
you used to like all that stuff.

259
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,997
UFOs and aliens.

260
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,167
She was quite a unique girl.

261
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,002
Why do you keep telling that story?

262
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,922
I didn't know she'd grow up
to be such a normal girl.

263
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,175
Back then, she was in
a seriously bad state.

264
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,262
She started hanging out
with a strange friend, and then--

265
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,263
Dad.

266
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,184
Do you want more ganjang gejang?

267
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,061
No.

268
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,813
No, it's fine.

269
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,736
How long have you been together?

270
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:42,282
We… Well, it's been about four years.

271
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,452
So, that's 1,482 days, right?

272
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,289
-And marriage?
-I certainly have it in mind.

273
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,668
It's about time you start living together.

274
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,048
Well…

275
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:05,055
Well, it's been a while now
that we've been seriously discussing this.

276
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,515
The truth is,

277
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,394
I was worried because my house
is a bit cramped for both of us…

278
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,192
And that issue was settled
not too long ago.

279
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,069
Then why aren't you living together?

280
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,238
I'm not telling you
to get married right away.

281
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,365
Try to live together before marriage.

282
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
You might think you know everything
about each other now,

283
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,662
but if you can,
try to live together for a while.

284
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,498
You may be able to save time that way.

285
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,377
Testing the waters before diving in
is not a bad thing to do.

286
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,295
Wow.

287
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,839
You're very wise, Mother!

288
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,059
Hey, Jihyo.

289
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,227
Where are you going?

290
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,980
To go get some ganjang gejang.

291
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,232
Excuse me.

292
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,821
Was it something I said?

293
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,453
Where are you?

294
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,788
Why aren't you coming back? Save me!

295
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,333
I'm coming back now.

296
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,132
-I'm watching you.
-I'm watching you.

297
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm watching you.

298
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,649
-I'm watching you.
-I'm watching you.

299
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,777
-I'm watching you.
-I'm watching you.

300
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,053
What the heck?

301
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,431
What is all this?

302
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,203
Hello?

303
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,540
I'm going to tell everyone!

304
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,292
No, don't!

305
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,210
What?

306
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,755
Hey, I know all about it.

307
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,257
That unresolved case
about the UFO downing in Seoul.

308
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,383
The Seoul UFO Incident.

309
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,761
Hey, you can't draw stuff like this!

310
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,137
What about it?

311
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,641
How should we draw the lady's face?
Back Yoonsun, the one abducted by a UFO.

312
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,976
Hey, wait. Don't do it to this person.

313
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,937
Why? We should do the same thing to her.

314
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,355
Why treat her differently?

315
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,775
No, what I'm saying is,
she said she met an alien.

316
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,153
You want to draw too? Forget it.

317
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,446
Just wait for a second.

318
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,249
Huh?

319
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,667
Huh?

320
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,710
Huh?

321
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,421
Huh?

322
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:56,972
Who's there?

323
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,267
What are you doing there?

324
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,483
All right, we have a few videos here.

325
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,237
In the first video,
you're enjoying a cigarette.

326
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,072
And here,

327
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,575
I'm not sure what you're doing.

328
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,618
Anyway, that's what you did.

329
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,496
Run.

330
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,125
To see where you went,
let's look at the next video.

331
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,543
Here.

332
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,087
This is the lobby of the building
where you were found.

333
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,631
You stood there for a while
thinking about something.

334
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,882
After that…

335
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,848
Yes. The end.

336
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,603
Why did you go up there?

337
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,814
What were you doing on that roof?

338
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,070
You're right.

339
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,699
Why was I up there?

340
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,410
I can't remember a thing.

341
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
Well, did you drink a lot?

342
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,336
I don't drink.

343
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,672
If you didn't drink,
then why did you black out?

344
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,300
Right, so then why…

345
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,885
How can that be?

346
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,350
Ma'am.

347
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,811
Do you know that
this is breaking and entering?

348
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,982
You might think you'll get off the hook
by beating around the bush like this,

349
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,651
but you got unlucky.

350
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,820
This guy

351
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:40,867
has been a play-by-the-book nutjob
since his Recon Marine days…

352
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,207
What?

353
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,794
What is this?

354
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,643
It's not so easy, is it?

355
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,811
Life, I mean.

356
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,315
It seems like I'm the only one suffering,
but that's not really true.

357
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,695
You know, I see all kinds of people
in this line of work.

358
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,280
Each of them has their own story.

359
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,574
And sometimes,

360
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:28,581
there are people that make me wonder,
"How can this world be so cruel to them?"

361
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,918
But even those people

362
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
keep living.

363
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,298
So what I'm saying is,

364
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,427
please don't do something like that.

365
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,512
It'd be such a waste.

366
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,683
You're so young, and also…

367
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,060
you know.

368
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,019
Sorry?

369
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,397
What did you say?

370
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,356
What?

371
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,317
You were saying something, right?

372
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,235
Jihyo!

373
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
Yes, sir.

374
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,492
Mr. Hong. I've just found her.

375
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,910
Yes. One moment.

376
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,251
I didn't tell your father
about you being at the police station.

377
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,754
But you have to tell me

378
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,214
where you went in the middle of dinner

379
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,592
and why you crawled out
of a police station.

380
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,638
Siguk.

381
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,891
Do you still talk to Doc Ma?

382
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,603
Doc Ma, you know? Hyungwoo. Huh?

383
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,730
I know who he is, but why?

384
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,983
I heard he opened a counseling office.
Do you know where it is?

385
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,652
He invited me, but I've never been there.

386
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,489
-Should I go visit him?
-Why are you bringing this up?

387
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,949
Does it fit in our conversation?

388
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,328
You bring up random stuff
like pro baseball and Doc Ma!

389
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,413
What is going on in your mind?

390
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,624
Let me know what's going on, please!

391
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,717
Why were you on that rooftop alone?

392
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,886
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

393
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,055
Then what was it?

394
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,567
Jihyo, are you going to live with me?

395
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,863
Siguk, I'm really sorry,
but can we just drop it for today?

396
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,286
I've been doing that
for the past four years.

397
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,165
I never asked. I gave you space.
I waited for you.

398
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,919
I've done that for four years.

399
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,131
How much longer do I need to do that?

400
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,427
What are you saying?

401
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,555
Do you still not know how I feel?

402
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,558
Of course I love you.
You're the only one for me.

403
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,227
I love you, yes. Okay?

404
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,396
Nayoung, I need to get to work.

405
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,814
Let's talk later.

406
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,483
Yes, love you too.

407
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,444
-Doc Ma.
-Oh my God!

408
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,906
You scared me, you punk.

409
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,993
Congratulations on opening your center.

410
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,038
You're giving this to me now?

411
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,457
It's only been seven months
since we opened.

412
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,294
But why did you come without Siguk?

413
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,795
Did you break up?

414
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,964
Hyungwoo, I see them.

415
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,303
I'm seeing them again.

416
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,306
The one wearing the baseball helmet.

417
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,645
This time, the problem is bigger.

418
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,814
It literally got bigger.

419
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,649
I mean, the size of it.

420
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,986
It was huge, like this huge!

421
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,823
It was so big I couldn't just ignore it.

422
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,658
And then?

423
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,535
How did you deal with it?

424
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,953
I ran.

425
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,540
I ran so fast but was suddenly surrounded
by a field of reeds,

426
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,292
and the van was there.

427
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,169
Reeds? A van?

428
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,421
What do you mean, a van?

429
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,383
It's just something I've seen in the past.

430
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,178
My friend and I used to hang out
in a weird, abandoned van

431
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,554
when I was in middle school.

432
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
Isn't that a hallucination?

433
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,767
Like all sorts of strange memories
mixed together and…

434
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,437
This isn't really important.

435
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,731
Who is the friend from middle school?

436
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,527
It's just a random memory.
It's nothing important.

437
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,615
I need to hear about what happened first
so I can see if it's important or not.

438
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,992
The most important part of counseling

439
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,496
is understanding
who you are and what you want.

440
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,582
To do that, you have to look back
on your ugly past.

441
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,043
What good does it do
to talk about who I am?

442
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,628
Then what did you come here for?

443
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,089
I want to stop seeing aliens!

444
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,800
I want to stop seeing them!

445
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,134
Why?

446
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,512
Why do I see these things?

447
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,598
What are those things?

448
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:56,933
And…

449
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,726
Why…

450
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,772
Why does it have to be the Unicorns?

451
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,192
All right.

452
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,403
Is anything else going on
around you these days?

453
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,909
Everything around me
is going perfectly well.

454
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,037
I'm the only one who's acting stupid.

455
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,581
How are your relationships with others?

456
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,959
They're fine, I guess,

457
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,754
but Sehee is more annoying than before.

458
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,797
Much more.

459
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,840
Oh Sehee?

460
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,885
Didn't Siguk and you two hang together
like the three musketeers in college?

461
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,970
We did.

462
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,349
But then I started dating Siguk.

463
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,894
That's when Sehee started acting
like an ex-girlfriend.

464
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,941
Not to Siguk, but to me.

465
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,777
If she's like this now,

466
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,613
it'll be much worse
when I start living with Siguk.

467
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,198
Wait, hold on.

468
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,533
Live together with Siguk?

469
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,161
Yeah.

470
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,830
Did I not tell you?

471
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,999
This is the stuff I was asking you about.

472
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,585
You should have told me that
from the beginning.

473
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,714
Hey, Jihyo.

474
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,468
Do you think you'll be okay
living with Siguk?

475
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,138
Is there something that's bothering you?

476
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:24,896
CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOLOGY CENTER
HAPPY CHILD - MA HYUNGWOO

477
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,907
Welcome home.

478
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,117
You haven't gone to bed yet?

479
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,412
I'm going to bed now.

480
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,415
Are you going to work tomorrow?

481
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,001
Yes.

482
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,378
Good night.

483
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,339
Hey, Jihyo.

484
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
Come have a seat.

485
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,391
How much longer are you going to act
like that towards your mother?

486
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,018
What do you mean--

487
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,022
When we were having dinner yesterday,
what made you so upset?

488
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,066
If something bothers you, say it.

489
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,276
You don't run out during dinner like that.

490
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,239
What is it that we did wrong?

491
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,117
What are you talking about?

492
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,578
It's not because of someone in particular.

493
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,205
Then why are you like that?

494
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,125
I don't know either.

495
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,546
How can you not know?

496
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,966
There's gotta be some sort of reason!

497
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
Huh?

498
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,343
Hey.

499
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,055
Are you planning to behave that way
in front of Siguk's parents too?

500
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,349
When you get married later,

501
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,184
your in-laws will call you crazy!

502
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,778
Hey, we're not done talking.

503
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,780
Come and sit down. Hey!

504
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,741
Hey, where are you going?

505
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,248
Welcome.

506
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,750
-Hi.
-Are you alone?

507
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,420
I'm meeting someone here. There she is.

508
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,131
Give me a break.

509
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,970
So, you were drinking?

510
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,138
Jihyo.

511
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,390
You get knocked out after one drink.

512
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,975
Hey. Jihyo.

513
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,406
Doc Ma called me.

514
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,034
And? So what?

515
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,204
He made small talk for a while.
Then, out of the blue,

516
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,997
he asked me how you and I were doing.

517
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,750
Damn it. That idiot.

518
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,418
Did you go for counseling?

519
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,839
What did you two talk about?

520
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,093
Is it something you can't tell me?

521
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,771
Why is it that, no matter what you ask,

522
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,608
you always ask such useless questions?

523
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,820
You want me to tell you?

524
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,572
You want to know?

525
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,170
I…

526
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,964
I…

527
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,967
I like loft apartments.

528
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,093
Huh?

529
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,346
I like loft apartments
with low heating efficiency.

530
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,099
I did get my job through connections.

531
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,476
The Unicorns were dissolved.

532
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,313
I'm not the same girl
that was in that van.

533
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,982
-What are you--
-So…

534
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:04,156
if I was a crazy person,
would you be able to live with me?

535
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,454
Can you do that?

536
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,373
You're not crazy though.

537
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,253
I mean, hypothetically.

538
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,423
Hypothetically, if I was crazy,

539
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,426
do you think you could?

540
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,055
You're not crazy though.

541
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,602
No, you bastard!

542
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,564
I mean, you're not crazy,
so that doesn't make any sense.

543
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,154
Let's break up.

544
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,077
I wondered how far you'd go.

545
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,084
Let's break up.

546
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,904
DAILY STEP GOAL ACCOMPLISHED
10.0 KM

547
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,795
Huh?

548
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,260
Do you believe in aliens?

549
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,972
Whether you believe in them or not,

550
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,558
aliens are much closer to us
than you think.

551
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,227
They even come to Korea quite often.

552
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,521
Are you interested in learning more?

553
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,064
