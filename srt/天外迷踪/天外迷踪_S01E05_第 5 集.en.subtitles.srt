1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,342
"It was 1976.

2
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:13,430
Twelve lights flashed
and moved slowly in the sky of Seoul.

3
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:18,935
According to witnesses, it looked like
the lights were headed exactly to Namsan.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:24,482
After the incident, many people claimed
to have experienced mysterious events,

5
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,110
which led to suspicions
that the lights were from UFOs.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,363
One of the people was Ms. Back,
an art major college student,

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:34,743
who was allegedly kidnapped by aliens
on her way home from her art class.

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,122
Ms. Back claimed
that aliens inserted a chip in her head

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,293
and that she occasionally communicates
with them using the chip."

10
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,298
So, what does she do now?

11
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:53,136
"It is unknown where she is right now
and whether she is alive or not."

12
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,804
I mean,

13
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,849
why are you so obsessed with something
that happened 30 years ago?

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,101
What are you going to do
if you find a UFO?

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,186
It's just

16
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,354
so frustrating.

17
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,690
There's definitely something out there.

18
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,942
That's why these stories keep coming out.

19
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,780
I just wish I could witness it
with my own eyes.

20
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:12,947
Satisfy my curiosity.

21
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,203
Then witness it with your own eyes.

22
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,499
This is what you're looking for, right?
A UFO formation.

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,049
It looks just like one!

24
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,217
Amazing.

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,302
How did you come up with this idea?

26
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,014
-Bora.
-Yeah?

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,391
Do you think aliens really came to Korea?

28
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,813
Breathe.

29
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:45,772
One.

30
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,190
Two.

31
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,650
Three.

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,110
Four.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,528
Five.

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,072
Next pose, Garudasana.

35
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,952
As you breathe in, lift your right leg
and cross it over the left.

36
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,463
Help me, please!

37
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,716
-Oh my God!
-What is it?

38
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,011
Call the police! The police!

39
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,346
Come out!

40
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,431
Let go!

41
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,600
-Dammit!
-I'm so scared!

42
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,146
Excuse me?

43
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,738
-Who is he?
-What are you doing here?

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
-What are you doing?
-Shoes!

45
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,248
-You can't come in here. Get out.
-I'm sorry.

46
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,333
Sorry.

47
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,340
Let's just get out of here, okay?
Just come out!

48
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:55,341
Huh? We…

49
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,676
Hey! Wait!

50
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,055
I'm not a weird person.

51
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,975
Well, first of all,
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

52
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,811
But there's a slight misunderstanding,

53
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,439
so I'll try to solve this
as quickly as possible.

54
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,065
You're not fooling anyone!

55
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,692
That bastard is a weirdo!

56
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,444
He's a cultist bastard!

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,738
-I'm not a cultist bastard.
-What?

58
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,698
Yeah, that's what all the cultists say.

59
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,699
Ladies!

60
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,202
You didn't know there's a strange church
on the floor above?

61
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,620
I don't believe in that church!

62
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,079
-A church upstairs?
-I'm actually…

63
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,248
-There's a strange church?
-What kind of church?

64
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm actually Catholic.

65
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,544
Bullshit!
Then what is your baptismal name?

66
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,463
Thomas.

67
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,466
Why are you going to that church
and not a Catholic church?

68
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,434
I'm trying to find my daughter, okay?

69
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,438
-Yeah, right.
-You came to film me, didn't you?

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,609
I saw the title of your broadcast.

71
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,653
Your content

72
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,988
is about me.

73
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,409
Then make a post.

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,870
-Why isn't he leaving?
-What?

75
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,915
Open the Direct Kim blog right now
and post something.

76
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,417
If it's really you,
you need to verify yourself.

77
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,047
What, did you forget the password
or something?

78
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,495
BLOG - DIRECT KIM
POSTING

79
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
What kind of house…

80
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,094
Wow, there's nothing in here.

81
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,018
I thought there were gonna be
pictures and maps

82
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,312
spread out all over the walls

83
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,356
like some psychotic detective
or something.

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,570
-Ask away.
-What?

85
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,157
You asked to meet me.
You said you had things to ask, so ask.

86
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,455
Your wife and son.

87
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,831
Where are they?

88
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,207
New Zealand.

89
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,127
Oh, you live apart from your family?

90
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,754
You must be busy.

91
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,256
Sending money abroad
and living a religious life.

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,176
So how long have you been doing
this cultist cosplay?

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,635
Four years.

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,308
Have you found out anything
about your daughter's whereabouts?

95
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,934
-I haven't.
-What?

96
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,645
I still don't know anything.

97
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,689
Where she went or what happened to her.

98
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,360
Well, then…

99
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,697
What have you learned about that cult?
What is their true identity?

100
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,242
What do you mean, identity?
They're just a cultist church.

101
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,788
You should know. You saw it yourself.
Why are you asking me?

102
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,331
You really think I don't know--

103
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,542
Why did you want to meet me?
What do you really want to know?

104
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm not even fully awake yet.

105
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,214
Sir.

106
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,427
How does a person levitate?

107
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,345
What?

108
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,984
I saw this at the place
my boyfriend last visited.

109
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,279
But I don't think a human can do this.

110
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,160
Mr. Direct Kim.

111
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,080
Do aliens really exist?

112
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,665
And if they do,

113
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,918
how are they connected to that church?

114
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,839
Gosh, it's too early for this.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,008
How can you ask such nonsense
so seriously?

116
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,923
SERGEANT KIM BYUNGJO
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ORDER

117
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,884
"Department of Public Order"?

118
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,247
The door's open.

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,211
Who are you?

120
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,837
Hello, ma'am!

121
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,631
I'm Sergeant Kim Byungjo.

122
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,798
Okay.

123
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,844
I won't cooperate.

124
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,930
What? But why…

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,306
Ma'am!

126
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,475
Ma'am!

127
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,645
Do you remember
the Hope & Light Assisted Living Facility?

128
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,190
It's a case you were in charge of
when you were an officer.

129
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,608
The mass suicide case.

130
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,237
Ma'am, I'm not asking for cooperation.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,114
I just want to ask you
a few simple questions about that case.

132
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,032
Hey.

133
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,370
I don't talk to the police.

134
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,371
Leave.

135
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,413
But why…

136
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,791
Where are you going?
I can give you a ride.

137
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,376
Can we talk on the way there, please?

138
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,710
Wait.

139
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,629
Ma'am, just three minutes! Two!

140
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,673
One minute! May I pay for the taxi?

141
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,853
-Yes, Kim Byungjo--
-This is Kim Byungjo's phone, right?

142
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,565
-Yes, but who--
-I was hoping we could meet to talk.

143
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,067
-Are you good for lunch?
-Hold on. Who's calling?

144
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,361
You know Jihyo, right? Hong Jihyo.

145
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,445
What?

146
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,906
The Newbeginnings Peace Corps?

147
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,950
Yes, or for short, NPC.

148
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,577
-NPC?
-NPC.

149
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,078
So, who are they?

150
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,708
A group of young adult volunteers
from Divine Light Church.

151
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,752
My plan is to join that group.

152
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,588
Why do you want to do that?

153
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,717
To find my daughter.

154
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,886
Okay, but what does finding your daughter

155
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,265
have to do with this NPC,
NBC, or whatever it is?

156
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,184
Explain the connection between the two.

157
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,186
I think

158
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,648
they possibly kidnapped my daughter.

159
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,816
"Possibly"?

160
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,861
Your daughter was kidnapped by the NPCs?

161
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,780
Why?

162
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,366
-Do you have any proof they did?
-No.

163
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,535
-Any reasons behind the theory?
-Not enough.

164
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,746
Then how do you call that a plan?

165
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,292
Fuck, so frustrating!

166
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,295
Fuck! How can you be
more frustrating than Jihyo?

167
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,380
I mean…

168
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,883
Do you usually talk like that?

169
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,384
Are you bad at Korean?

170
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,889
Come on! Try to clearly explain it!

171
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,060
What exactly do these NPCs do,
and why are you suspicious of them?

172
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,853
Did they really kidnap some--

173
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,730
I really don't know either!

174
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,732
That's why I'm stuck here like this!

175
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,948
As for what they do,
it's kept secret within that church.

176
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,743
There's no way to find out

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,163
unless you're accepted
as a member of the group.

178
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,334
Anyway, at the moment,
the NPCs are the most suspicious.

179
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,002
That's all.

180
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,879
That's all?

181
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,922
I mean…

182
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:18,844
Mister.

183
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
What did you even do
during those four years?

184
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,184
Your daughter's life is on the line.
Why are you so laid-back?

185
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,479
Shouldn't you kidnap that real estate lady
and torture her or something?

186
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,232
Stop talking nonsense!
You don't know anything!

187
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,567
If four years have passed,
she's probably already…

188
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,320
She's probably already what?

189
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,280
Dead?

190
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:40,825
Miss.

191
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,703
I'm her father.

192
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,250
For some reason, I don't trust him.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,920
I can't tell how much
of what he's saying is true or not.

194
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:59,343
It's always the most innocent-looking ones
that are the most insidious on the inside.

195
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,477
Hey.

196
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,939
-Huh?
-Your boyfriend isn't dead.

197
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,401
It was just a slip of the tongue.

198
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,070
He's not dead. I know that for sure.

199
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,239
Thank you.

200
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,579
But that's not why I'm like this.

201
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,081
Then why?

202
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,377
Bora…

203
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,880
I must really be crazy.

204
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,674
What's with you? You're freaking me out.

205
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,592
What is it?

206
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,198
Jihyo, are you out of your mind?

207
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,283
I know, that's what I'm saying.

208
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,327
What was I thinking? Why did I do that?

209
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,328
Hey!

210
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,500
Stay right there, dammit!

211
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,919
-Hey!
-Quickly!

212
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,796
Stop!

213
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,591
Hey!

214
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,261
We'll make sure to bring it back
when we're done with it!

215
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,971
Sorry!

216
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,232
You crazy, frustrating bastard!

217
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,494
This is Direct Kim's hard drive?

218
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,207
He collected every photo
the cult members posted

219
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,501
on KakaoTalk and social media.

220
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,418
Why?

221
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,753
Fuck, I have no clue.

222
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,297
Maybe he thought these could be evidence.

223
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,013
Doing useless stuff like this,
no wonder he hasn't found his daughter.

224
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,935
All right, next folder.

225
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,437
"Sister Seo Hwajung's KakaoTalk."

226
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,314
Pork belly?

227
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,153
I'm really sorry. I'll be there
for our next counseling appointment.

228
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,949
What are you doing
that's making you miss our sessions?

229
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,201
I'm doing something really important.

230
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,371
Yeah, but what are you doing
that's so important?

231
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,164
I'll tell you next time.

232
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,042
Hyungwoo, didn't you say
you could do that thing?

233
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,919
-What? Hypnosis?
-Hypnosis therapy.

234
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,883
You said you learned it in college.
You went to some seminar.

235
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,468
I went to flirt with girls.

236
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,804
Why are you randomly bringing it up now?

237
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:54,143
Can it perhaps bring back
forgotten memories and stuff?

238
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,190
Jihyo, what are you doing?

239
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,859
Are you not off the phone yet?

240
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,611
Yeah, sorry. I'm coming.

241
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,738
-Hyungwoo.
-Hurry up and switch with me.

242
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,157
I'll call you back later, okay?
I'm hanging up.

243
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,241
Hey, Hong Jihyo.

244
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,912
That punk always says
whatever she wants and hangs up.

245
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,747
Did you find anything?

246
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,084
I found out that the real estate lady
loves pork belly.

247
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,422
Cap, refill, please.

248
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,054
Hey.

249
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,514
I still can't believe it.

250
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,768
To think that the uptight church guy
was actually Direct Kim.

251
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,562
Exactly. It'd be better if it wasn't.

252
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,563
Why?

253
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,982
You said you've been
looking for him for years.

254
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,233
Shouldn't you be happy?

255
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,070
I've been searching all those years
just to find such a frustrating man

256
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,488
that drives me nuts.

257
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,158
-Frustrating…
-Dammit.

258
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,664
Fuck, my head hurts.

259
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
Dammit.

260
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:08,926
What is it?

261
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,888
What is this?

262
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,733
That's the place.

263
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,901
The place?

264
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,294
Wait.

265
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,629
Wait a minute.

266
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,146
Are you sure?

267
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,568
-I'm sure. This is the place.
-You're not confused with somewhere else?

268
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,028
I'm not confused!

269
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,488
I'm not confused.

270
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,699
I would never be.

271
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,790
Direct Kim, that little prick.

272
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,294
I knew there was something fishy
about that real estate lady.

273
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,302
Look.

274
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,139
The top of my head is so hot!

275
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:42,853
If you raise me this high,
I'm too close to the lights!

276
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,689
I feel like an ant
under a magnifying glass!

277
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,192
Should I lower you a bit?

278
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
Lower me a little bit!

279
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,444
Yes, of course.

280
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,279
DOWN

281
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,574
There we go. Yes.

282
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,658
More.

283
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,994
Great. More.

284
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,120
Stop!

285
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,875
-Thank God. I think this is good.
-Okay, then I'll lift you up this high.

286
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,835
Don't relax your back.

287
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,337
Okay!

288
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,841
Oh, good job.

289
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,094
Great.

290
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:17,846
Safe landing.

291
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,847
OFF

292
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,849
Great work.

293
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,601
You did well!

294
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,311
Phew! Gosh, my back.

295
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,522
Jeez, my back hurts.

296
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,111
I'm sorry I put you through
so much trouble each time, Chanwoo.

297
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,278
It's no problem.

298
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,281
It's the least I can do to receive grace.

299
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,912
COME IN

300
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,956
Go!

301
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,626
-We're really doing this?
-Fuck, why are you hesitating?

302
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,461
What if we really get caught?

303
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,631
She's at the church service right now!
We need to do it now.

304
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,675
What if she forgot something
and comes back?

305
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,927
Dammit! Are you going to do this or not?

306
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,179
We need to know who made that drawing.

307
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,163
I'm in.

308
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,332
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

309
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,625
Oops.

310
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,044
Chanwoo, are you busy today?

311
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,004
No.

312
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,757
Do you think you can pick up
Brother Han for me?

313
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,426
Sure. Do you have other plans?

314
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,595
I have something important
I need to attend to.

315
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
Ah, okay.

316
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,431
-I'll leave it to you, then.
-You got it.

317
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,895
Dammit, why isn't this working?

318
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,855
Hey. Do you really know how to do that?

319
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,649
I just saw it on YouTube. Don't rush me.

320
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,443
Hurry up!

321
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,531
Shit. Why isn't it inflating?

322
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,076
-Hurry up!
-Oh, don't rush me!

323
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,712
What is it?

324
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,467
Fuck.

325
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,595
Hey, give it here. Move.

326
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,805
Ah, seriously!

327
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,149
Oh, hey, it's working.

328
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Hey!

329
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,027
Just a little more!

330
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,862
Yes!

331
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,406
It's gonna work!

332
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,494
Hey, it worked! It worked!

333
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,496
-Put it in.
-There, go in.

334
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,337
We're in.

335
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,463
Get in!

336
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,760
Dammit.

337
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,595
Hey.

338
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,430
Why is this so complicated?

339
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,808
-How do you turn this thing on?
-What did you say?

340
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,559
Turn the GPS on already.

341
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,228
Why are there so many switches?

342
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,522
I don't know how to turn it on either.

343
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
What? I thought you had a license.

344
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,112
I don't use it.

345
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,364
God!

346
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,285
HOW TO TURN ON A GPS

347
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,953
We have the search engine for this.

348
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,747
Fuck, you're really killing me.

349
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,170
It looks like you have to start the car
to see the GPS.

350
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,965
-Shit, how?
-Try and start the car.

351
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,882
How do I do that?

352
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,136
What the heck?

353
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,305
-Chanwoo.
-Yes.

354
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,932
If you join the NPC,
you'll have to double your work.

355
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,642
-You know that, right?
-Hey, hide!

356
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:55,939
I don't share the content
of our group chat with anyone.

357
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,482
But you're a great prospect.

358
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,985
-This way!
-Hey!

359
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,238
-Go over. Hide!
-Why, thank you.

360
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:08,452
You are erasing what I share with you
in the chat room, right?

361
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,581
-From the group chat.
-Of course.

362
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,417
I take a look
and then erase them immediately.

363
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,418
Attaboy.

364
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,380
-Confidentiality is?
-The pillar of faith!

365
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,049
That's right! Good!

366
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,383
Excellent!

367
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,053
-Not yet!
-I'll get going.

368
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,473
Oh, wait, Sister Seo!

369
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,390
Oh my!

370
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,273
And…

371
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,153
I mean, you don't look so well lately.

372
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,946
Frankly,

373
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,619
I feel like you've been
overworking yourself lately.

374
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,537
I'm worried about you.

375
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,748
What do I do?

376
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,710
Chanwoo, you are so cute!

377
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,006
Gosh!

378
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,341
Okay.

379
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,677
You pretend to not care,
but you're quite considerate.

380
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,012
Right.

381
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,932
Huh?

382
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,309
Anyway, what are those types called again?

383
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,727
There's a word for it.

384
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,813
What the kids say nowadays.

385
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,398
-Oh.
-Hmm? It's…

386
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,239
Is that Brother Han?

387
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,157
Answer it.

388
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,659
-Go ahead.
-Ah, yes.

389
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,952
Answer it, quick.

390
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,204
-I'm leaving. Thank you!
-All right. Yes.

391
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,063
Hello, Brother Han.

392
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,281
That's my relationship with Jihyo. Got it?

393
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,700
Uh, but…

394
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,828
How long has it been
since you two started dating?

395
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,288
I'm not dating Ms. Hong.

396
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,585
You're not dating,
so you're just friends with benefits?

397
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,505
Friends with benefits?
There's nothing going on between us yet.

398
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,590
"Yet"?

399
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,217
So, you're planning to?

400
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,720
I'm not planning to do anything, okay?

401
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,724
We just keep in contact with each other.

402
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,435
Yes. So, what is it
that you guys talk about?

403
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,817
What I'm saying is… hmm?

404
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,570
How deeply in love are you guys

405
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,948
that you keep a straight-laced person
like Jihyo from going home?

406
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,912
Ms. Hong doesn't go home?

407
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,829
No.

408
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,707
She doesn't even come to work as much.

409
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,294
So much so that
her dad was so worried that he called me.

410
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,087
What?

411
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,257
Aren't the two of you living together?

412
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,182
What?

413
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,100
What is it?

414
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,693
I want to see the Light's face

415
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,197
I want to praise you forever

416
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,200
We shall leave together

417
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,204
And follow the…

418
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,874
DEACON KIM CHANWOO

419
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,793
Hello?

420
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,879
Hello, Sister Seo. This is Kim Chanwoo.

421
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,299
Yes, Chanwoo.
Did you drop off Brother Han?

422
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,300
Yes.

423
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,303
By the way, where are you now?

424
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,680
I'm driving.

425
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,014
Why?

426
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,267
-Oh, Sister Seo.
-Yes?

427
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,686
Nothing unusual happened, right?

428
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,481
Huh, what?

429
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,359
-Why would there be anything unusual?
-What do we do?

430
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,111
-Right.
-I'm driving right now.

431
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,821
What are you talking about?

432
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,407
What's up with this man today, seriously?

433
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,993
-Right.
-Oh no. I need to turn left here.

434
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,245
-Chanwoo, I'm driving right now.
-Oh goodness!

435
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,330
-Yes!
-I'll talk to you back at church.

436
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
-Okay.
-I'm hanging up.

437
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,166
-Bye.
-Okay, goodbye. Yes.

438
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,543
What's with him?

439
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,717
Hm, hm, Light, Light.

440
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,885
Light, hm, hm, Light.

441
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,556
I want to see the Light's face

442
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,435
I want to praise you forever

443
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,563
We shall leave together

444
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,732
And follow

445
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,900
The

446
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,862
Light

447
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,821
Jihyo.

448
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,615
Hey, Jihyo.

449
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,752
Hey, you can't draw stuff like this!

450
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,337
Let me see.

451
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,219
You're not going home today, right? Jihyo!

452
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Hey, Jihyo!

453
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:25,977
Quick, get up.

454
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,062
Hey!

455
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,229
Hey, wake up!

456
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:29,856
Jihyo!

457
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,316
Wake up quickly!

458
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,485
Jihyo. Huh?

459
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,948
How can you fall asleep in this situation?

460
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,826
Get up quickly.
That lady just got out of the car.

461
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,934
ALLOW MAPS TO ACCESS YOUR LOCATION?

462
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,187
Dammit.

463
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,522
Where are we?

464
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,524
I don't think we'll catch a taxi out here.

465
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,652
Let's try going in there.

466
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,155
Hey, are you crazy?

467
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,908
The lady said she would be
going back to the church later.

468
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,744
Let's wait until then and go inside
since we're already here.

469
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,830
Hey, why would we go in there?

470
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,581
It's just a house.

471
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,375
The house she lives in.

472
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,794
Do you really think so?

473
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:34,921
Think about it.

474
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,464
That lady's job is in Seoul.

475
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,925
Her church is in Seoul.
Her license plates are from Seoul.

476
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,803
Why would she have a house
so far out here?

477
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,097
Especially since
she's a real estate agent.

478
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,098
Isn't it strange?

479
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,860
THE MARCH OF BLESSING

480
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,533
Sister, it's Chanwoo.

481
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,412
Are you all right?

482
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,502
My gosh.

483
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,548
Yes, I see her.

484
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,093
Yes.

485
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,013
He's so unbelievable. Jeez.

486
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,396
Hey.

487
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,857
You. Stand guard.

488
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,150
Stand guard?

489
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,614
Where are you going? Stop! Hey!

490
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,531
Dammit!

491
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,700
Hey! Huh Bora!

492
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,702
Huh Bora!

493
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,914
Huh Bora!

494
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:51,915
Hey!

495
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,416
Jeez.

496
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,293
Hey!

497
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,444
Mom!

498
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Mom!

499
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,533
It's time to eat!

500
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,331
I made soybean stew for you!

501
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,254
Mom.

502
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,673
Mom.

503
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,716
Lunch.

504
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,677
Do you want to watch TV while you eat?

505
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,011
Yeah, all right.

506
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,138
I can't let you do that!

507
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,682
I'll help you.

508
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,934
Careful.

509
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,103
-Goodness.
-All right!

510
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,938
Here it comes!

511
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,898
We succeeded!

512
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,485
-Wow, Kinder, you're amazing!
-Yay! It's good that we listened to Tayo!

513
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,654
Mom. Say, "ah."

514
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,407
Ugh, isn't it too dangerous?

515
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,242
-It's always you doing it alone.
-"Ah."

516
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,454
Mom, I'll peel an apple for you,
so eat that.

517
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,582
I'm going to the church.
I'll come back tomorrow.

518
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,128
You can be home alone, right?

519
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,046
I'll come back in just a bit, all right?

520
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,890
-This is so fun!
-Careful.

521
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,266
-"Ah."
-I'm not sure.

522
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,979
A cult?

523
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,524
Wait, so you're saying

524
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,402
that Lee Siguk's gotten into a cult?

525
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,653
Excuse me.

526
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,781
You can't say anything for sure just yet.

527
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,576
If we bring it up in front of Ms. Hong,
she might get upset.

528
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,287
That's why I was keeping my mouth shut.

529
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,164
That's weirdly convincing.

530
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:01,586
A person like Siguk might
really get pulled into stuff like that.

531
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,759
So, then,

532
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,845
are you investigating it now?

533
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,349
It's not even an investigation.

534
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,560
It's just something
I'm looking into on my own time.

535
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,645
And?

536
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,188
How are you looking into it?

537
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,024
Are you going around
asking people questions?

538
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,276
Yeah, I have to run around for now.

539
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,487
Staring at the computer
doesn't get me anywhere.

540
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:29,989
I got it.

541
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,909
I'll help you.

542
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,204
-With what?
-You said you're working alone, right?

543
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,540
Who's going to help you?
Two heads are better than one, you know.

544
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,459
Like a dual-core.

545
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,585
No, thanks.

546
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,010
Yippee! It's good that
we listened to Tayo!

547
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,138
-Ugh, isn't it too dangerous?
-Hey.

548
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,975
-It's always you doing it alone.
-Pew, pew.

549
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:57,892
Hey!

550
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,728
This is so fun!
What should we do after the exams?

551
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,230
-I'm not sure!
-Hey!

552
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,856
Don't!

553
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,443
Hey!

554
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,195
-Stop it!
-Okay.

555
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,947
She's completely lost her mind.

556
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,659
-Jihyo, let's begin.
-What?

557
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,995
What do you mean, "what?"
Let's start the search.

558
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,621
Search for what in this house?

559
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,207
I don't know!

560
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,167
Your boyfriend's finger or something.

561
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,295
Don't run so fast! It's dangerous!

562
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,841
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

563
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,092
I didn't know.

564
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,096
Thank you, Tayo.

565
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,523
You shouldn't hesitate to give
stern advice, even to your friends.

566
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,775
All right, I'll remember that.

567
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,988
The school classes are over.

568
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,449
What was that sound?

569
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,284
Don't come near me!

570
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,957
-Stop right there!
-No!

571
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,879
You shouldn't hesitate to give
stern advice, even to your friends.

572
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,722
Have this.

573
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,223
Heart doesn't like it!

574
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,477
Be careful.

575
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,734
What did I do wrong?

576
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,573
I can't believe I yelled at a friend.

577
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,784
Tayo.

578
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,333
Sorry?

579
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,919
Tayo.

580
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,047
-Tayo the Little Bus!
-Oh.

581
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,007
Yes.

582
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,094
You're right. That's Tayo.

583
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,637
Tayo.

584
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,138
Jihyo, what are you doing?

585
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,307
-Does the granny love you?
-Tayo.

586
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,767
Come here and look at this.

587
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,727
Tayo.

588
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:10,274
Tayo…

589
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,661
Wow.

590
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,330
Fuck, getting old is terrible.

591
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,041
Nobody can defeat the passage of time.

592
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
Damn it.

593
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,475
But why do all of these photos
have the same background?

594
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,312
They were taken at the same place.

595
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,647
BAEK-IL NATIONAL WELFARE CENTER

596
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,859
Wait.

597
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,988
This is a familiar face.

598
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,128
Shit!

599
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,591
That scared me.

600
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:27,185
Bora, I will go and search another room.

601
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,811
Yeah.

602
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,322
Bora! Come here!

603
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,069
What is all of this?

604
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,710
Huh? Hey!

605
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,712
-Hey, hide!
-Shit!

606
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,193
Who is it?

607
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:21,882
Ah, hell…

608
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,592
Give it back!

609
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,637
Give it to me!

610
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,515
My God, the NPCs?

611
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,226
That was all nonsense, right?
You made it up, huh?

612
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,645
Why did you tell us such a flimsy lie?

613
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,189
Look. You got busted right away!

614
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,319
It's because I knew you would go around
searching places and causing a mess.

615
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,571
Do you know how much
of a nuisance you guys are?

616
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,240
I nearly had a dozen heart attacks today.

617
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,076
Those drawings are the locations
where UFOs appeared, right?

618
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,082
We've come this far,
so just tell us everything you know.

619
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,751
-What was that we saw?
-Yeah.

620
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,919
Who drew all those pictures?

621
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,007
What is this church, really?
What is your relationship with aliens?

622
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,635
Yeah, and did that real estate lady
draw all of those?

623
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,306
Don't try to fool us again!
We saw everything in here!

624
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,891
Okay, all right!

625
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,226
Just please be quiet. Please!

626
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,522
The Holy Mother drew them.

627
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,523
-Huh?
-What?

628
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,609
The Holy Mother of Divine Light Church.

629
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,444
You mean like the Virgin Mary?

630
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,695
So who is that?

631
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,616
What do you mean?
You must have seen her inside!

632
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,159
Inside?

633
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,079
What?

634
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,414
Did you see her?

635
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,510
That granny with dementia?

636
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,595
How could that grandma be…

637
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,891
How can she know my boyfriend disappeared
and draw the picture of the location?

638
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,101
Huh?

639
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,148
Huh? Please stop keeping silent about this

640
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,942
and give us an explanation!

641
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:05,986
Please?

642
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,240
Sir!

643
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,283
Sir!

644
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,786
Dammit.

645
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,121
Oh!

646
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,622
Huh?

647
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:20,376
I just remembered where I saw this woman.

648
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,378
What?

649
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,592
Jihyo, you know about her too.

650
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,010
What?

651
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,472
Back Yoonsun.

652
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,807
What?

653
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,975
The Back Yoonsun?

654
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,060
Yes, the Back Yoonsun
from the Seoul UFO Incident.

655
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,562
What's the Seoul UFO Incident?

656
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,564
The attempted shoot-down
of a UFO in Seoul.

657
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:46,193
In 1976, in the sky of Seoul,
the UFOs appeared in a formation.

658
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,280
Back Yoonsun is the woman
who claimed she met aliens that day.

659
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,865
Something like that happened in Korea?

660
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:55,536
This woman claimed in an interview
that she could communicate with aliens.

661
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,165
She said that they planted
some sort of chip in her head.

662
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,082
Wow.

663
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,000
Hey, Jihyo.

664
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,544
Do you not remember anything?

665
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,547
You had this all memorized
in middle school.

666
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,844
Anyway, so what happened
to Back whatever-her-name-is?

667
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,764
She disappeared after the interview,
so there were a bunch of rumors.

668
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,268
Some said a secret institute
took her to do research or whatnot.

669
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,103
Hey, wait a second.

670
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:26,025
You're saying that you found Direct Kim
and Back Yoonsun?

671
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,486
The first person in Korea
to encounter aliens?

672
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,238
How did a missing person like her
become the Holy Mother of a cult?

673
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,699
Yeah. Where has she been this whole time?

674
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,409
I think she was here.

675
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:37,870
Look at the date.

676
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,873
All of these photos were taken
after the interview date.

677
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,836
"Baek-il National Welfare Center."

678
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,296
What sort of place is that?

679
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,923
I don't know.

680
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,092
It says "National,"
so it seems to be a public facility.

681
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,971
It's a private psychiatric hospital now.
New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

682
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,265
They changed their name twice.

683
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,975
It used to be
Hope and Light Assisted Living Facility.

684
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,143
Where is it located?

685
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,563
Here.

686
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,274
Jeonju. It's 4 hours and 31 minutes away.

687
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,526
Cap.

688
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,443
Yeah?

689
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,528
Drive us there.

690
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,279
-What?
-What?

691
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,281
-You're going there now?
-Cap.

692
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,742
No, I can't.

693
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,786
If I don't sleep at night,
I'll lose muscle.

694
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,539
Jeonju raw beef bibimbap.
Perfect in carbs, protein, and fat ratio.

695
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,000
Yes!

696
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,877
What do you mean, "yes"?

697
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,128
Nice travel!

698
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,505
I'll go pack.

699
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,048
What travel?

700
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,927
Wow! How are you guys in sync
all of a sudden?

701
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,262
Hey, Moonhole.

702
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,348
Why in the world are you going there?
And why now?

703
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,517
Of course it's now.
Should I wait until Christmas?

704
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,604
If you're curious,
you can go to Back Yoonsun and ask--

705
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,690
Why would I talk to a crazy old grandma?

706
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,025
Then you can ask Direct Kim--

707
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,112
Forget about him.
I'd rather go and choke myself.

708
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,406
Dammit! I'm scared of places like that!

709
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,407
Then don't go!

710
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,160
Hey, Jihyo. We're going right away, okay?

711
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,251
Give me an hour.
I need to go home for a second.

712
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,045
We'll meet here in an hour.
If you're late, we're leaving you behind.

713
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,297
-Okay!
-Okay!

714
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,299
Ugh, please!

715
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,883
None of this is even confirmed.

716
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,386
You don't even know what's there!
Give me a reason for this!

717
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,471
Damn it! Stop looking for a reason!

718
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,474
Not everything in this world
has a fucking reason.

719
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,119
MATH 1ST SEMESTER SAMPLE QUESTIONS

720
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,705
THE ATTEMPTED SHOOT-DOWN
OF A UFO IN SEOUL

721
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,673
The calm before the storm.

722
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:59,428
Those who laughed at me in the comments
and are laughing at me even now,

723
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,139
I never responded to them.

724
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:06,560
Tonight, I'll be stepping
into the heart of a mystery.

725
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,562
Do you all suck?

726
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,314
Or do I suck?

727
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,608
The result will determine that.

728
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,920
Are the others not here yet?

729
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,923
They never come on time.

730
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,885
-What about Cap?
-He's lifting weights outside.

731
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,053
-At this hour?
-Twenty-three…

732
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,805
He's doing it now
in case he can't tomorrow.

733
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,931
Twenty-five.

734
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,766
-Twenty-six. Twenty-seven.
-Bora, here.

735
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,114
Hey, look.

736
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,198
My work of art.

737
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,701
Hey.

738
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,748
Of course you don't remember it,
you airhead.

739
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,964
Damn, this is incredible.

740
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,966
Even the notes are still here.

741
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,220
I didn't know
highlighters lasted for this long.

742
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,060
Bora.

743
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,729
I can see aliens.

744
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,444
It started in high school.

745
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,904
I just see them sometimes.

746
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,241
When I'm minding my own business,

747
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,535
I see one standing there.

748
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,038
Just looking at me.

749
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,917
No, wait.

750
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
Aliens? What kind of aliens?

751
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,344
You know the one.

752
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,431
The one we drew in middle school.

753
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,102
This?

754
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,940
Lately, I don't see the alien so often.

755
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,401
Since when?

756
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,113
I'm not sure.

757
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,115
Ever since I met you?

758
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,538
You saw this?

759
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,294
Why do you take my nonsense so seriously?

760
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,882
When you left a message in my guest book,
was it because of that?

761
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,428
Well, that and Siguk too.

762
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:53,143
But I don't know why I'm here telling you
about my hallucinations.

763
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,146
I've never mentioned it
outside of my therapy sessions.

764
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,482
Do you remember the phrase "screen image"?

765
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,658
If you witness something so shocking
that it's incomprehensible,

766
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,993
the human mind covers up that image

767
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:15,040
with a different image,
something familiar and digestible.

768
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,461
You know, something like this.

769
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,131
Something so shocking
that it's incomprehensible?

770
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:24,883
Like what?

771
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,678
Well, for example,

772
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,514
seeing a real alien.

773
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,766
A real alien?

774
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,567
What if, you know,

775
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,694
they aren't hallucinations?

776
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,281
What if aliens really exist?

777
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,283
And if I can see them,

778
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,535
what does that make me?

779
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,210
What does that make you?

780
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,129
An airhead who sees aliens.

781
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,769
A hundred and twenty.

782
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,106
A hundred and twenty-one.

783
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,526
A hundred and twenty-two.

784
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:37,664
Mom.

785
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,667
Are you awake?

786
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,504
Gosh!

787
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,760
Did you fall asleep here
watching television again?

788
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,179
I told you to sleep in your room!

789
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,847
I can't believe you.

790
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,931
Dad.

791
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,600
She has finally shown herself!

792
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,146
She has come!

793
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,359
She has finally

794
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,569
come!

795
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,242
The Messiah!

796
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,577
The Messiah

797
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,998
is finally here!

798
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:24,748
