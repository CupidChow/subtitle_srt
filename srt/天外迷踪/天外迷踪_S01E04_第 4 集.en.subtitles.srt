1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,013
Jihyo.

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,432
Do you really not remember anything?

3
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,526
Is there anything that comes to mind?
You can tell me, okay?

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,035
Why did you go there in the first place?

5
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,749
Just…

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,044
to meet a friend.

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,962
A friend?

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,505
A friend? Who is this friend?

9
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,638
You know that junk car you played in
with your friend, right?

10
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,225
I found a few empty alcohol bottles
in there.

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,650
Did you drink anything other than that
with your friend?

12
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,321
What?

13
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,532
Your friend's name is Bora, right?
Huh Bora.

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,122
Huh Bora.

15
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,499
Hey, what are you doing?

16
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,416
Hey!

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,752
…for teaching, rebuking, correcting…

18
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,504
Fuck off. I'm going to record this.

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,255
Hey, what did you just say?

20
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,341
I'm going to get it
before the battery dies.

21
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,634
What are you doing?

22
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,677
Hey! Don't open it!

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,679
Give us the courage
to take down the tents…

24
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,972
Ah, dammit…

25
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,516
Let go.

26
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,934
Let go!

27
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,019
…who are not clean in flesh and spirit.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,188
-Sella.
-Wait!

29
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,147
Shit!

30
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,315
Hey!

31
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,192
Tell it to get away!

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,527
Get it away from me!

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,779
-Get it away!
-Be quiet!

34
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,197
Jiyong!

35
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,033
Jiyong! Come here!

36
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,201
Jiyong!

37
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,037
Huh Bora. Be quiet!

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,998
You called me this early in the morning
to watch this?

39
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,167
Do you think
I could make a teaser out of this?

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,919
About a minute long?

41
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,089
But you didn't get anything.
And everything is a bunch of murmurs.

42
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,591
How long were you stuck
in that air-conditioning plant room?

43
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,509
Eleven hours.

44
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,386
Wow, shit!

45
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,513
What are you, Prince Sad?

46
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,523
-Let's tail the realty lady.
-Let's go to the cops.

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,234
-Are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

48
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,445
Why do you always go to the police?
They won't help you at all.

49
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,031
Why do you always say
the police won't help?

50
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,741
What's the reason?

51
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,413
First of all, I don't trust them.

52
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,414
Second,

53
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,208
they can't do anything for us right now.

54
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,501
But why not?

55
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,130
Look.

56
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,340
That's 67.7V/m.

57
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,302
The outer space electromagnetic bandwidth
from your boyfriend's room.

58
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,348
You spent your nights looking for this
like a maniac in middle school!

59
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,853
Bora, look.

60
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,022
Those guys we saw earlier,

61
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,523
they were people.

62
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,151
They weren't aliens, okay?

63
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,320
Those suspicious people were right there,

64
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,489
so why is this important right now?

65
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,407
You're right.

66
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,118
Those people are
the decisive piece of evidence.

67
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,953
You saw it too.

68
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,831
You saw it with your own eyes,
where your boyfriend disappeared.

69
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,459
Do you really think that's something
human beings could do?

70
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,462
Those freaks definitely know something.

71
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,048
That's why I'm saying
we should follow her.

72
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,681
DAD

73
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,481
-That's not important right now.
-Where are you going?

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,482
The police station.

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,984
Dammit! How many times
do I have to tell you?

76
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,445
What?

77
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,325
This is the only thing
we can do right now!

78
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
You're chickening out, aren't you?

79
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,082
Fine.

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,504
So your boyfriend's life is at stake,
but you're too scared to solve it.

81
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,006
And you feel too guilty to just give up.

82
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,175
"Fuck it. Let's file a report,
and forget all this."

83
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,844
"All of this is annoying. I can't do it."

84
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,680
Isn't that what you're thinking?

85
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,891
Hey!

86
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,519
I don't know about you, but I can do it!

87
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,438
So I'm asking you
to trust me just this once.

88
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,524
Huh?

89
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,363
How can I ever trust you?

90
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,617
I've already gotten burned once
for trusting you.

91
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,122
Because of you,
I was passed out for three days.

92
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,043
You don't even remember, right?

93
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,088
You…

94
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,257
You just left me there.

95
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,971
Did you even try to look for me?

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,558
Hey, kid.

97
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,518
Kid!

98
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,146
Do you even remember what happened?

99
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
Hey, Jihyo!

100
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,525
Hey, Jihyo!

101
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,193
Hey, Jihyo!

102
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,988
Jihyo!

103
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,073
Please answer me!

104
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
Do you clearly remember

105
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,578
if I made you sniff the glue or not?

106
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,499
Hey, I was unconscious then.

107
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,753
So you cut someone off
over something you don't even remember?

108
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,838
It was you who cut me off!

109
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,548
It was you, you fucking bitch!

110
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,632
Jihyo!

111
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,263
What's going on?
Is it okay for you to be out here?

112
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,765
When did you wake up?

113
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,517
Didn't you see my texts?
Why didn't you answer…

114
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,734
Hello?

115
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,613
Would you like to come
and have a chat with the police officers?

116
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,614
All right, let's go.

117
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,076
What's going on? What are you doing?

118
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,327
Hey, Jihyo.

119
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,745
Jihyo!

120
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,636
With this, you'll just be making a video
for Loser TV, not Moonhole TV.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,721
"Shocking news."

122
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,015
"A church lady breaks
into someone else's house?"

123
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,932
Pew, pew.

124
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,851
"A YouTuber uploads
a video without a video."

125
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,810
Pew, pew.

126
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,940
-Pew, pew…
-Pew, pew…

127
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,276
-Hey, Cap.
-Huh?

128
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,613
What were you in the military?
Special forces? Special--

129
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,282
Special Forces NCO. Why?

130
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,285
Is that sort of like The Iron Squad
or something like that?

131
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,043
Rather than using
the "pew, pew" sound here, I think…

132
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,224
Try to get out.

133
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,808
Try and escape, okay?

134
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,237
Great!

135
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,821
What is?

136
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,785
Cap, what are you doing later today?

137
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,915
SEOUL GEOAN POLICE STATION

138
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:01,916
A prayer?

139
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,877
It wasn't just any regular prayer.

140
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
At all.

141
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,130
The prayer was suspicious?

142
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
How so?

143
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,885
Like they were speaking in tongues.

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,053
Like…

145
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,771
Sella!

146
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,737
I'm sorry. Gosh!

147
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,282
So, anyway…

148
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,078
you think those people
might have kidnapped Mr. Lee Siguk?

149
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,374
I'm not certain, but those people
are connected somehow.

150
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,085
If not, why would they go
into a missing man's house and…

151
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,803
Wait, if you saw that yourself,

152
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,472
doesn't that mean you were in the house?

153
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,352
You…

154
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,689
You didn't break into that house, did you?

155
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,652
No.

156
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,864
Seriously, Ms. Hong!

157
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,657
Detective, why are you scolding me?

158
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,368
They're the ones
who broke into the house as a group!

159
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,747
I get that you're suspicious--
You're driving me crazy!

160
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,749
How far are you going to go?

161
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,668
This is the police's work. The police!

162
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,380
I provided you with Mr. Lee's bank records
and everything!

163
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,134
Gosh.

164
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,321
Gawa Competition Team, this is Oh Sehee.

165
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,115
Oh!

166
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,367
Mr. Hong!

167
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,368
What?

168
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,495
Another man?

169
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,498
Jihyo did?

170
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,168
She didn't come home yesterday.
She was probably with him.

171
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
He even came to our house before.

172
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,424
I think she's seeing some police officer

173
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,259
from the Department of Public Order.

174
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,260
A police officer?

175
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,971
You know, I'm only saying this
because it's you,

176
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,973
but she's not doing so well these days.

177
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,059
And she's super into weird things.

178
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,811
Weird things?

179
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,481
When she was little,
she had a huge obsession with something.

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,692
I'm sorry to ask,

181
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,236
but has Jihyo been having problems
at the company?

182
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,571
Is she doing well at work?

183
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,574
Hey, Sehee.

184
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,996
I know it's shameless of me
to ask you to do,

185
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,419
but do you think you could meet with Jihyo
and have a serious conversation with her?

186
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,504
I mean, Sehee,

187
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,549
you're Jihyo's soul mate, aren't you?

188
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,385
Before we get started,
let's look into some companies.

189
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,803
Understood.

190
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,139
You can count on me, Mr. Hong.

191
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,396
Did you look at the sash? It's brand-new.

192
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,066
Your timing coming here was crazy.

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,737
You know how expensive
leasing is these days, right?

194
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,654
Yes.

195
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,657
The landlord doesn't know much
about the market these days.

196
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,785
So, that lady is the leader of the cult?

197
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,580
Not the leader,
but they called her "sister" or something.

198
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,168
Why are you filming
that perfectly normal woman?

199
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,128
She has spent all morning showing houses.

200
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,797
We're too far to pick up any audio.

201
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,340
Cap, let's get a little closer.

202
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,383
Don't get close!

203
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,634
Let's just go.

204
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,803
Aside from the fact that it's illegal,

205
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,931
this is totally inefficient and creepy.

206
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,433
You didn't have to come.

207
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,811
Why did you have to come
and annoy us with your grumbling? Moron!

208
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,563
I get lonely by myself at the café.

209
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:53,564
Oh? She's leaving.

210
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,648
Let me see.

211
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,360
Cap, let's roll!

212
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,863
Where is this lady going this time?

213
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,365
Probably to another neighborhood
filled with studios.

214
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,493
Yes, I'm telling you. You should invest.

215
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,038
When the area gets redeveloped,
the value will go up by millions!

216
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,122
Yes!

217
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,792
Oh dear. I'm here to see another property.

218
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,960
The call will get dropped
when I get on the elevator.

219
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,713
I'll call you back later. Bye!

220
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,089
Hey! Wait a moment!

221
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,418
Going up to the 12th floor.

222
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,176
Hey, why am I here?
What do you want me to do?

223
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,761
-Bodyguard.
-Why?

224
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,222
Are we gonna fight or something?

225
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,391
If we get caught, we'll probably have to.

226
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,727
Also, you will be fighting, not we.

227
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,187
While I'm running away.

228
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,481
Jeez. I'll lose muscle if I fight.

229
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,943
Hey, Cap.

230
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,863
Have you ever wanted
to go back to the military?

231
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,072
No, I haven't.

232
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,825
Don't you get tired of selling coffee
ever since being discharged?

233
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,203
Maybe you don't feel as alive
as you once did?

234
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,413
Or perhaps…

235
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,666
Do you ever miss the danger of death
on the battlefield?

236
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,751
Or feel addicted to that feeling?

237
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,461
You don't feel anything like that?

238
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,046
No!

239
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,174
I don't experience that.
I'm satisfied with my life.

240
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,096
Stop shaking that!
How much more of it do you need?

241
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,559
You have arrived on the 12th floor.
Going down.

242
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,479
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

243
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,148
Light be with you.

244
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,816
This is the message of Light.

245
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,152
Chapter 2, verse 17.

246
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,490
"Therefore, according to the Light,
do not be hindered.

247
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,952
The path you are walking down
is the right path.

248
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,581
May the path you are walking down
be the right path."

249
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,498
Sella,

250
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,500
Sella.

251
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,882
Thank you for coming, Brother and Sister!

252
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,301
Sister, is this your first time here?

253
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,011
-What?
-Who invited you here?

254
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,515
What is that there?

255
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,319
What were you filming?

256
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,955
Is this all there is?

257
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,167
Hey, Donghyuk. What are you doing?

258
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,127
Donghyuk, look here.

259
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,712
Come on. Just once!

260
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,424
Donghyuk, you moron!

261
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,969
You didn't film anything else?

262
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,056
What is this, then?

263
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,401
It's true. We are a cult.

264
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,987
We know it.

265
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,532
We know how we might look
to the outsiders.

266
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,493
In the eyes of the mainstream churches,
we're just a cult.

267
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,996
Nothing more, nothing less.

268
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
We're all sick of it,

269
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,084
of being the laughingstock.

270
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,754
That's why we're a bit sensitive
to being recorded.

271
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
We'd appreciate your cooperation on this.

272
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,467
But what sort of--

273
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,137
I'd like to ask you to leave quietly now.

274
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,807
Yes. Let's go.

275
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,018
Let's go.

276
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,686
Let's go.

277
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,898
I came here to kill myself.

278
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,400
What?

279
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,949
I was headed to the rooftop,

280
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,495
but I saw you people
getting off the elevator.

281
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,580
Laughing.

282
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh fuck.

283
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,794
I came here to die,
and you were all laughing!

284
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,797
So, what is it that you want from us?

285
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,383
Well…

286
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,472
Can you fill me in, too,

287
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,349
on what's so funny?

288
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,852
Why does everyone look so happy here?

289
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,979
What is it that you do here?

290
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,990
Brother Kim, I heard there were guests?

291
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,867
Oh, yes, Sister.

292
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,203
-I was talking to them, yes.
-So this is them.

293
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,205
Okay, so these are our guests.

294
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,331
Wow!

295
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,167
His body is…

296
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,627
Oh wow!

297
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,047
I mean, how do you build a body like this?

298
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,381
Oh my goodness.

299
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,176
Yes, through progressive overload
and training…

300
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,349
What's the matter?

301
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,477
She's gone through
a lot of hardships lately.

302
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,104
You did good by coming here.

303
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,605
-Don't cry, okay?
-Don't cry.

304
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,024
Oh my goodness.

305
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,109
Oh dear.

306
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:38,200
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH
A DEDICATED SERVICE

307
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,201
Uh…

308
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,372
My name is Kwak Dajung.

309
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,374
-Light be with you!
-Light be with you!

310
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,502
Welcome, Brother Kwak Dajung.

311
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,212
Please continue, yes.

312
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,463
Oh, right.

313
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,382
I'm 35 years old.

314
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,509
I own my own café,

315
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,220
and my hobby is weight training.

316
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,931
Personally, I focus on bodybuilding
rather than powerlifting--

317
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,350
Have you experienced that moment?

318
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,477
-Sorry?
-Oh.

319
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,939
She's asking
if you've ever met the Light. Right?

320
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,524
-Sister?
-Oh, yes!

321
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,362
There are a few that come here
who have met the Light.

322
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,159
I am confused about which light
you are talking about.

323
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,077
A light that is not of this earth.

324
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,496
Not a light from the stars or planes.

325
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,791
Light is not bound by the laws of physics.

326
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,627
If you've seen it,
you would've recognized it immediately.

327
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,380
You mean a UFO?

328
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,049
Well…

329
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,509
Brother, I'm sorry.

330
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,678
We don't use that word here.

331
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,724
The meaning of that word
is too human-centered.

332
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,559
Oh, I see.

333
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,563
I saw it when I was in the military.

334
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,108
Could you tell us about it in detail?

335
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,319
Well…

336
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,946
So, I…

337
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,991
Your glory comes

338
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,411
That bright and profound Light

339
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,539
Shrouded by the cloud

340
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,335
That bright Light in the sky…

341
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,341
-Sella.
-Sella!

342
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,592
Louder now, Sella!

343
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,093
-Sella!
-Sella!

344
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,514
After washing all my tears
I shout out loud…

345
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,432
What's that?

346
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,226
It's the March of Blessing.

347
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,897
Before we hold our Light calling service,
we march around the church like that.

348
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,732
Can't we go there too?

349
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,485
Oh, the thing is…

350
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,153
I'm sorry, Sister.

351
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,864
Newcomers have to go through
a period of adjustment

352
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,574
before their first service.

353
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,076
I'm sorry, Sister.

354
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,494
Oh, okay.

355
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,841

NEW EMAIL

358
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,522
Hello, Mr. Direct Kim.

359
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,692
My name is Hong Jihyo.

360
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,780
I know we haven't met,
but I have to ask you something.

361
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:25,117
My boyfriend also disappeared…

362
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,415
BOYFRIEND ALSO DISAPPEARED

363
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,929
You're chickening out, aren't you?

364
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,111
You saw it with your own eyes
where your boyfriend disappeared.

365
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,685
Fuck.

366
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,396
I thought it would be something amazing.

367
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,482
Why do they use this junk for service?

368
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,194
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

369
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,698
Fuck.

370

372
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,647
ANSWER PLEASE. WHAT'S THIS VIDEO?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

373
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,940
MOONHOLE TV
CULT INFILTRATION!

374
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,154
This lovely…

375
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,916
Wrapped around…

376
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,420
Wrapped around…

377
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,922
The glory shall come

378
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,757
THE CULPRITS BEHIND DIRECT KIM'S CASE!

379
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,093
Wow, LOL, is she crazy?

380
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,928
Hello, Mystery Lover!

381
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,680
Hi!

382
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
This is insane…

383
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,477
That bright Light in the sky…

384
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,856
This is a secret camera, so please excuse
the bad video and the lack of commentary.

385
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,108
If I get caught now, I'm fucked!

386
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,192
-Sella!
-Sella!

387
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,444
-Sella!
-Sella!

388
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,280
-Sella!
-Sella!

389
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,658
What, is this for real?

390
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,620
She comes back with next-level content
after a long break.

391
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,622
You see my level, huh?

392
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,291
This isn't fake.

393
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,711
I fuckin' told you.
I only stream it if it's legit.

394
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,338
We will find it

395
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,842
Oh, we will find it

396
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,052
Are you not taking missions?

397
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,763
What? Missions?
Always welcome if the price is right.

398
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,266
Dammit.

399
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,517
HUH BORA
CALLING…

400
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:44,024
We shall leave together
And follow the Light

401
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,154
The grace that awaits me…

402
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,950
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE? ARE YOU CRAZY?

403
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,331
Mission. Watch the cultists' service
for 50,000 won.

404
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,583
Only from the Light

405
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,337
DONATE TO MOONHOLE TV

406
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,381
We shall leave together…

407
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,550
Donate?

408
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:15,430
And follow the Light

409
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,768
-Sella.
-Sella!

410
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,604
-We are happy.
-Sella!

411
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,066
All right, Brothers and Sisters.
We will now move into the service hall.

412
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,567
-Sella!
-Sella!

413
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,402
Sella, yes!

414
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,532
550 VIEWERS
FUCK, WHO'S THAT?

415
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,867
Where were you?

416
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,452
Shit, I almost pissed myself!

417
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,497
Let's go home now.
It's two hours past my mealtime.

418
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,291
Forget your meals.
You're supposed to be distracting them.

419
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,460
If I don't eat, I lose muscle.
If that happens--

420
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,003
-Brother Kwak Dajung!
-Yes!

421
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,633
Did you find the sister
who came here with you?

422
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,302
No?

423
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,348
-She must have gone home first.
-Is that so?

424
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,349
Let's go back in.

425
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,767
-Yes, go ahead.
-Yes.

426
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,737
It is pitch-black.

427
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,326
Nothing can be seen.

428
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,164
The darkness is surrounding us.

429
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,210
Look around you.

430
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,008
You can't see what's in front of you
in this dark world.

431
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,512
This is what the Holy Mother prophesied

432
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,348
the end to look like!

433
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,268
-Sella!
-Sella!

434
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,231
Brothers and Sisters, don't be afraid.

435
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,277
To save this dark world,

436
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,280
the Light is coming down.

437
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,867
The Messiah is coming down!

438
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,245
-Sella!
-Sella!

439
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,165
Break away from your carbon bodies!

440
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,167
-Sella!
-Sella!

441
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,295
Gain new bodies of photons!

442
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,382
-Sella!
-The Messiah is coming!

443
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,384
Light be with you!

444
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
-Sella!
-Sella!

445
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,763
Oh, 100,000 won.

446
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,349
Thank you for the 100,000 won donation,
Lovely Jihyo.

447
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,977
Huh?

448
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,147
What if you get caught,
and something happens to you?

449
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,565
Get out of there now.

450
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,776
It must be your first time
watching my broadcast.

451
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,028
Nothing's going to happen.

452
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,071
-Sella!
-Sella!

453
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,322
Just relax.

454
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,618
If you can't keep up,
just sit back and watch.

455
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,746
Why you…

456
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,626
Get out now. Right now. Get out.

457
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,212
-Get out.
-Sorry, I'll close donations for a moment.

458
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,797
-I'm a little busy.
-Light be with you!

459
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,049
-Sella!
-Sella!

460
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,802
-Light be with you!
-Sella!

461
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,845
Break away from your carbon bodies!

462
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,074
MOONHOLE TV IS LOGGED IN ON ANOTHER DEVICE

463

Almighty Light, may your light
make the souls of the sinners truthful.

471
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,518
Cleanse this body of sins
and lift me up to the sky!

472
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,447
O Light, come to me!

473
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,201
Messiah!

474
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,746
O Light!

00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
O Light!

476
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,544
-Come to me!
-Sella!

477
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,131
Sella!

478
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,135
O Light!

479
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,099
Please save us!

480
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,185
Come to me!

481
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,355
Almighty Light!

482
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,940
Messiah!

483
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,625
There it is.

484
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,370
Fuck, this will get me views
on YouTube, right?

485
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,920
O Light!

486
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:47,131
KNOCK PLEASE

487
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,928
MOONHOLE TV IS BROADCASTING

488
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,467
Shit, this is real.

489
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,137
So these are the guys
who kidnapped Direct Kim's daughter.

490
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,307
This is the reason
why I'm still a Moonhole viewer.

491
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,559
Today's stream is legendary.

492
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,811
Whoa, insane. Wow.

493
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,147
Oh fuck!

494
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,860
Hey, are you okay?

495
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,737
Amazing.

496
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,532
Moonhole, where do you find these cults?

497
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,743
This is art.

498
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,578
Please don't get caught.

499
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,581
If you tell me where that is,
I'll give you 30,000 won.

500
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,666
What even is that group?

501
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,376
Where is that?

502
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,378
Did you see it, everybody?

503
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,507
I told you I'd do it.

504
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,927
I said I would find those punks
from the Direct Kim case, didn't I?

505
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,054
Holy…

506
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,811
What a crazy bitch.

507
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,729
Fuck!

508
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,533
-Jihyo.
-Huh?

509
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,452
What have you been watching all day?

510
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,037
Can we talk for a minute?

511
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,705
Yeah.

512
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,375
Shit!

513
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,428
You haven't been answering my messages.

514
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,682
I was worried.
I thought something happened.

515
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,308
And you were late today too.

516
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,768
I…

517
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,104
I had something to take care of.

518
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,984
-Let go.
-Let go, dammit!

519
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:05,163

MOONHOLE TV'S BROADCAST HAS ENDED

525
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,392
Phillip! This is Lovely Jihyo!

526
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,978
Oh, yes. I saw the broadcast!

527
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,564
Please send me the location
of that building right away!

528
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,900
-I'm in a rush, so I'll hang up!
-What are you going to do?

529
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,984
Troll!

530
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,736
Taxi!

531
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,863
Hello!

532
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,532
Yes, Detective Kim. I need your help!

533
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,451
What? Ms. Hong, what's the matter?

534
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,620
I think something bad happened
to my friend!

535
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,704
Please come quickly!

536
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,540
I believe!

537
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,045
Hallelujah! Great work today.

538
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,464
Excuse me.

539
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,640
Hey…

540
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,269
You…

541
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,897
Hey! You…

542
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,954
What's wrong with you!

543
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,389
Get out!

544
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,686
Hey, where is she?

545
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,687
Huh?

546
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,356
The police are on their way,
so don't try anything funny!

547
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,817
Huh? Where is my friend?

548
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,652
Where did you take her?

549
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,787
Sir! He's right here!

550
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,705
Sir!

551
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
Right here!

552
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,792
-Sir! It's this man!
-Grab her.

553
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,461
-Get her!
-Huh?

554
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,588
-Come here.
-No, it's not me!

555
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,465
It's him, not me!

556
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,175
Why are you taking me?

557
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,926
That person is the cultist!

558
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,180
No, Bora!

559
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,599
LETTER OF APOLOGY

560
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,017
I won't ask for much.

561
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,437
A sincere letter of apology will do.

562
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,189
Okay.

563
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,443
Things like this are inevitable
for a religious man like me.

564
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,113
More so because our doctrine
is somewhat exceptional.

565
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,784
Some people don't like us.

566
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,540
Anyway, if possible,
I'd like to let this incident slide.

567
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,708
Okay.

568
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,129
Ms. Hong, you heard him, right?

569
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,801
Sir, well,

570
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,387
with all due respect,

571
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,474
what sort of religion
do you follow, specifically?

572
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,477
In terms of our ties,
we are a Christian denomination.

573
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,730
-We aren't an official order--
-Christian, my ass.

574
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,065
Hey, now!

575
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,984
Stop interrupting, please.

576
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,654
Please continue.

577
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,949
Aside from our doctrine,

578
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:14,078
the business is properly registered
and all taxes are paid.

579
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,831
Oh, you must be paying taxes
to the aliens, huh?

580
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,332
Hey! Seriously.

581
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,709
But why do you ask?

582
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,961
Oh, well…

583
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,090
Actually, there are
some things we need to confirm.

584
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,594
The thing is, we dispatched our officers
because we got a call claiming

585
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,516
that you and your church are involved

586
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,226
in a kidnapping--

587
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,895
Hang on! Kidnapping?

588
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,064
Are you speaking about these two here?

589
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,117
That's not true, as you can see.

590
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,995
You're right.

591
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,539
That's not all though.

592
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,626
There should be at least two more people.

593
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,296
My boyfriend
and another person's daughter.

594
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,380
Hey!

595
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,888
You know what this is, right?

596
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,557
I told you to write a letter of apology.
What have you been doing?

597
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,564
This symbol was at the place
where my boyfriend disappeared.

598
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,941
The same symbol was at your church.

599
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,485
What are you talking about?

600
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,528
How are you going to explain?

601
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,200
See? Look at him keeping his mouth shut.

602
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,619
Bora. You saw this earlier, didn't you?

603
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,786
Tell them.

604
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,247
Huh? What?

605
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,001
What do you mean, "what"?

606
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,753
The thing you saw at the church.

607
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,673
They shot lasers at the walls
and made this symbol.

608
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,468
Cap, did you see something?

609
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,095
See what?

610
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,681
We don't know what you're talking about.

611
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,727
Hey, what's wrong with you?

612
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:06,315
You were jumping up and down
because you filmed all of it!

613
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,234
What in the world are you talking about?

614
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,151
Hey!

615
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,029
Why are you doing that?
Do you know how much I donated to you?

616
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,365
All right! That's enough! Okay!

617
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,201
Ms. Hong. Enough!

618
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,788
Why are you only targeting me?

619
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,291
All right, everyone else can go home now.
We're basically done here.

620
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,043
Okay. Let's go.

621
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,588
Yes. All right.

622
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,969
-I'll get going too.
-Yes.

623
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,971
Sir, I'll call you.

624
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,305
See you, then.

625
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,307
-Where do you think you're--
-Ms. Hong.

626
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,185
You can leave
after finishing the letter of apology.

627
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,896
Do you want to get sued? Huh?

628
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,151
Oh gosh.

629
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:04,039
Hey! Ho! Café! Come on! Hey!

Wow.

Hey, troll!

Our newest member, Lovely Aunt.

636
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:33,902
Come in. Let's get wasted.

637
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,827
You look like you're having fun.

638
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,122
Why are you so upset?

639
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,465
You stabbed me in the back.

640
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,217
What are you doing right now?

641
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,223
God, that hurt my ears.

642
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,100
Hey, don't yell.

643
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,102
You'll make me sober up.

644
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,524
What happened to you earlier?

645
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,027
And why did you act like that
at the station?

646
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,780
Does it make you happy
to make someone look foolish?

647
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,239
Are you some sort of pervert?

648
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,117
I told you I don't trust the police.

649
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,703
I didn't want to give them
any information.

650
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,205
What else was I supposed to do?

651
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,414
Even if that's…

Wait. Did you do all this with my money?

654
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,554
No.

655
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,182
It's my money now.

656
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,101
You gave it to me, after all.

657
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,689
Huh Bora!

658

Why do you keep yelling?

660
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,654
What do you want me to say?
What am I supposed to do?

661
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,700
-Ouch!
-Apologize.

662
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,201
Apologize to me.

663
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,994
I got handcuffed because of you.

664
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,788
I deserve to hear your apology.

665
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,335
No, you don't.
You're the one who should apologize to me.

666
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
I should apologize to you?

667
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,927
Yeah.

668
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,180
You made me look foolish,
not the other way around.

669
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,766
-When did I do that?
-You said you couldn't trust me.

670
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,185
You said you'd rather trust the police.

671
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,021
So, did I fail to get anything?

672
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,941
Hey!

673
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:41,447
I almost thought for a second
that you were a pretty cool person!

674
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,448
The… What is it?

675
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,909
When I saw you fearlessly waltzing
inside the crazy cult like an idiot,

676
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,204
it was just for a moment,
but I even admired you.

677
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,666
But now, look at you guys.
How could you screw me like this?

678
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,084
Who are you calling an idiot?

679
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:58,088
Hey, I used my head to get in there,
but you busted in alone without a plan.

680
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,841
Wow, you're so fucking cool!
Who do you think you are?

681
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,259
-Hey.
-Are you Liam Neeson?

682
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,511
Are they hating or loving each other?

683
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,513
Love and hate are inseparable.

684
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,098
Do you know how scared I was?

685
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,767
You could've just stayed put!

686
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,060
Why did you come running
to freaking save me?

687
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:14,563
It's my choice!

688
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,816
It's my choice!

689
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,152
What is it?

690
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:24,156
You've been making it obvious all day
that there's something you want to say.

691
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,240
So what is it?

692
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,453
Did Park Sunyoung say something to you?

693
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,376
She said I shouldn't hang out with you.
That you're a delinquent.

694
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,380
She said…

695
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,425
She saw you sniffing glue yesterday

696
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,220
with the boys from Kyungin Middle School.

697
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,139
I don't believe her

698
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,643
because you promised me
you wouldn't do it again.

699
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:57,231
Either way, she doesn't have
any proof of what she said.

700
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,735
Then why do you trust me?

701
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,905
I don't have any proof either.

702
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,827
Well, it's my choice.

703
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,332
It's my choice
to believe something or not.

704
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,419
It's my choice!

705
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,803
For God's sake.

706
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,430
Gosh!

707
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,439
They're supposed to be grown-ups? Sheesh.

708
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,905
Hey!

709
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,658
What is this?

710
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,744
Is this alcohol?

711
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,425
Dammit.

712
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,176
I can't drink alcohol.

713
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,563
Hey, Jihyo.

714
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,322
You want to go somewhere with me tomorrow?

715
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,788
Sure. Yeah, let's go.

716
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,377
Let's go.

717
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,006
Go…

718
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:24,962
Jeez.

719
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,020
"Another person's daughter."

720
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,693
CASE SEARCH

721
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,237
2014 - ELDERLY MASS SUICIDE
HOPE & LIGHT ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY

722
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,050
How are you still not sobered up?

723
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,053
Well, how are you totally fine?

724
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,394
About the church yesterday…

725
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,732
you know
how the real estate lady levitated?

726
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,900
She did.

727
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,320
An image popped into my head
at that moment.

728
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,073
An image?

729
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,120
A weird image.

730
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,663
What kind of image?

731
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,754
Why did you stop talking?

732
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,639
Hurry up.

733
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,698
Where is this, anyway?

734
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,451
Just wait. You'll soon find out.

735
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,495
Whose house is this?

736
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,292
Hey. I rang the doorbell, right?

737
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,044
Someone will come out, right?

738
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,421
So you'll find out whose house this is.

739
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,976
No one's coming out though.

740
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,019
Fuck, wait. This is the right place.

741
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:34,025
Is it really that hard to just tell me
whose house this is?

742
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,195
What the hell? Where did he go?

743
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,280
Is he asleep?

744
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,284
Give me a hint.

745
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,661
It's a man.

746
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,122
-A man that I know?
-Yeah.

747
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,374
-Phillip.
-No.

748
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,792
-Donghyuk.
-No.

749
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,460
-Captain Price.
-No.

750
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,255
The person you're calling is--

751
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,549
Wait, is it Detective Kim's house?

752
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,676
Are you crazy?
Why would I come to a cop's house?

753
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,639
Then who else could it be?
We don't know any other men.

754
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,224
Why isn't he answering the door?

755
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,526
There.

756
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,528
Say hello.

757
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,946
This is Direct Kim.

758
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,656
What?

759
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,034
I heard your boyfriend went missing.

760
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,369
What?

761
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,881
Are you coming in or not?

762
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,258
Whoa, why is your house so empty?

763
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,344
It's like a storage closet.

764
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:17,605
