1
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,770
Huh?

2
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,709
Do you have someone you trust?

3
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,544
Bora! Over here!

4
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,591
Someone you can
open up to about everything.

5
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,884
Jihyo, what are you doing?

6
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,470
Someone you can reveal
your deepest secrets to.

7
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,807
Do you have someone like that?

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,269
I thought I'd get captured
and killed for sure.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,649
Or get dragged away by them.

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,610
Like Siguk.

11
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,737
So what happened afterward?

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,534
I don't know.

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,288
I don't really remember
what happened after that.

14
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,418
How did I come back unharmed?

15
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,340
Well, it's great that you came back safe.

16
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,344
No, it's not.
I came out without achieving anything.

17
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,012
But is that really it?

18
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,057
What?

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,518
The reason you went all the way there.

20
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,646
Was it really just to save your boyfriend?
No other reason?

21
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,898
I mean, why else would I?

22
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,733
Didn't you go there to find something?

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,528
For example,
some sort of evidence or an answer.

24
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,488
If that's not it, maybe a memory.

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
What kind of memory is it?

26
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,744
When is the memory from?

27
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,412
When I was in middle school.

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,997
Middle school?

29
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,167
The location?

30
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,549
A field of reeds.

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,717
-A field of reeds.
-Yeah.

32
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,345
It's where I would meet Bora.

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,430
Field of reeds. Bora.

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,696
What's wrong?

35
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,662
Nothing. It's nothing.

36
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,164
Okay.

37
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,751
Now, try to remember
what happened then. Okay?

38
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,337
In middle school.
In a field of reeds. And?

39
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,968
What happened there?

40
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,930
What happened there?

41
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,976
Quickly. Tell me.

42
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,605
What happened there?

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,982
In middle school…

44
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,359
In middle school…

45
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
In a field of reeds…

46
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,697
In a field of reeds…

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,825
What happened there?

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,327
Middle school, field of reeds…

49
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,912
In middle school… There…

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,250
Do you think you can remember?

51
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,295
Huh?

52
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,047
What?

53
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,216
No, it's…

54
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,552
What happened? Why are you stopping?

55
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,138
I'm sorry. The screen suddenly…

56
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,641
What about the screen?

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,286
Abigail!

58
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,415
-Grab her!
-What's happening?

59
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,667
-Grab her!
-What's this?

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,335
Hey! Who are you guys?

61
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,003
-Who are you?
-Abigail!

62
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,046
Let go!

63
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,757
Hey! Let me go!

64
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,758
Let me go!

65
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,718
Let go!

66
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,388
Let me go!

67
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,515
Let go! Fuck!

68
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,641
I'm sorry, Your Holiness!

69
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,725
Let go!

70
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,910
So it was three nights before
when you last spoke to her?

71
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,079
Did she say anything in particular?

72
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,582
Like about what she might be doing
or where she's going?

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,835
She said she was going
on a business trip, I told you.

74
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,878
A business trip? Where to?

75
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,381
It doesn't matter what she said.

76
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,716
It's all a lie.

77
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,135
I checked everything.

78
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,762
Gosh, I thought she was going to see you.

79
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,930
That's really not the case.

80
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,598
No.

81
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,977
Then do you know
of any place she might be?

82
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,812
That punk went to find Siguk.

83
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,356
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,025
What's ridiculous about it?

85
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,361
They had been in love for over four years.

86
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,990
Would she have packed so little
if she had left the country?

87
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,160
She's not acting like her usual self.

88
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,537
-There's definitely something wrong.
-Goodness…

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,539
Are you that clueless
about your own daughter?

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,708
Ow!

91
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,627
Just a moment. Excuse me.

92
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,088
Yes, Detective Kim. This is Kim Byungjo.

93
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,051
Really?
They've got her credit card details.

94
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,552
Yes, when was it used?

95
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,722
That was two days ago. Where was it used?

96
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,850
Which tollgate?

97
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,685
Jeonju?

98
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,312
-Jeonju?
-Sorry?

99
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,566
Did you say "jot"?

100
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,526
No! Not jot.

101
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,987
Job! Like Job from the Bible!

102
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,365
What's with his name? Who is he?

103
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,618
You know, the pastor of that cult.
The man named Moon Hyungtae.

104
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,913
I think those people call him
Job among themselves.

105
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,914
You know,

106
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,541
the more I thought about the church,
the more suspicious it seemed.

107
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,001
So I did some research.

108
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,962
And do you know
where I found this man's name?

109
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,130
Where?

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,216
-The register.
-The register?

111
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,219
The register of the hospital
where the suicide case took place.

112
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,888
The current owner of that building
is this person.

113
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,976
But the transfer of ownership happened
after that cop lady got fired.

114
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,479
That's why she had no idea

115
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,815
about this obvious connection!

116
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,277
Wait, that psychiatric hospital,

117
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,780
isn't it in Jeonju?

118
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,917
COME IN

119
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,548
SISTER JUNG:
THIS IS THE WORD OF THE MESSIAH

120
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,632
SISTER KIM: SENT A PICTURE

121
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,342
SISTER YANG:
THE MESSIAH IS TRULY THE LIGHT

122
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,479
SISTER JUNG: SELLA…

123
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,369
The person you have called is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

124
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,875
Hello, Chanwoo.

125
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,252
This is Seo Hwajung.

126
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,671
You must be busy
now that you're a team leader.

127
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,840
Why aren't you taking my calls like usual?

128
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,550
I was just wondering

129
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,388
if you have some time,
we could chat over a meal together.

130
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,681
It's been a while.

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,602
I've been so down lately.

132
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,399
Anyway, if you get this,
call me back, please.

133
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
Bye.

134
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,261
Fuck!

135
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,641
Bora.

136
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,892
Calm down.

137
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:21,852
Give me that.

138
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,813
Give it.

139
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,023
Give me that.

140
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,441
Give it…

141
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,288
Ah, fuck!

142
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,042
Fucking piece of shit!

143
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,669
What are you doing right now?

144
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,754
Are you crazy?

145
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,633
What were you gonna do?
Kill her with this?

146
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,135
Will this even kill her?

147
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,763
Where are you going? Hello?

148
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,433
Dammit, what are you going to do now?

149
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,060
Are you really planning on capturing
and torturing Sister Seo?

150
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,229
That won't solve anything!

151
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,859
For now,
we just need to sit back and watch.

152
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,361
Do you think I'm like you?

153
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,032
Your friend won't die.

154
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,534
How would you fucking know that?

155
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,785
I just do. Okay?

156
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,039
They can't ever kill Jihyo.

157
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,543
Why not?

158
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,128
Why can't they kill her?

159
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,798
Because she's the Messiah.

160
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:33,883
What?

161
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,802
Hong Jihyo is the Messiah.

162
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,068
Stay there a while longer.

163
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,654
You're probably still dizzy.

164
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,629
I'm truly sorry for binding your wrists.

165
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,173
It couldn't be avoided.

166
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,884
You were being so threatening.

167
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,302
Why are you doing this to me?

168
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,055
Who are you?

169
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,933
Ms. Hong.

170
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,520
I know you're surprised,

171
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,564
but please try to calm down

172
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,152
because I'd like to explain
this whole situation to you.

173
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,530
Where is Siguk?

174
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,783
Are you talking about your boyfriend?

175
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,702
Where is he?

176
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,495
I know you guys took him.

177
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,498
Would you believe me
if I said it wasn't us?

178
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,375
Tell me where Siguk is right now!

179
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,919
This isn't good.

180
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,464
If you keep acting like this,
we won't be able to have a conversation.

181
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,258
I'm not interested in a conversation.

182
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,053
Then could you just answer my questions?

183
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,848
-They're simple questions.
-No, I don't think I can.

184
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,933
-Bring Siguk here right--
-It's not a hallucination.

185
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,150
That strange figure you see sometimes.

186
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,568
Strictly speaking,

187
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,528
it's not a hallucination.

188
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,447
What?

189
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,411
To put it simply, they're like a GPS.

190
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,664
And they led you here to us.

191
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,751
They work sort of like a pager.

192
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,254
Wait, so that, that's--

193
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,548
Ms. Hong, you have multiple experiences

194
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,926
of electronic devices
malfunctioning around you

195
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,887
for no reason, right?

196
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,976
Aren't you curious?

197
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,773
About why these strange things
keep happening to you?

198
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,360
Yes.

199
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,742
-Wait, hold on!
-Yes, okay.

200
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,869
Hang on. What you were saying--

201
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,455
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

202
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,373
No, tell me what you mean!

203
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,043
What do you mean it's not a hallucination?

204
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,462
What…

205
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,216
What is it if it's not a hallucination?

206
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,889
A messiah?

207
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,017
-What, Jihyo is?
-That's what they say.

208
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,062
I have no clue either.
This is giving me a headache.

209
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,481
So then, what will happen to Jihyo?

210
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,399
Well, I don't know,

211
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,110
but they probably won't harm her
since she's their Messiah.

212
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,153
"Probably"?

213
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,404
Are you sure?

214
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,324
How am I supposed to know
what those lunatics are really thinking?

215
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,495
That's all I've heard from Sister Seo.

216
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,414
And only a few people
from the church know, for now.

217
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,838
Anyway, what I'm saying is
that you should be more careful.

218
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,549
You push too fast,
and it'll just get more dangerous.

219
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,343
Fortunately, she's not in imminent danger.

220
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,979
Now I get it.

221
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,566
You wasted four years
with that kind of attitude

222
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,026
because it wasn't urgent.

223
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,778
Because you needed to be careful.

224
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,657
But I don't have time to waste like you.

225
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,658
Hey, miss!

226
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,994
Since this is all my fault.

227
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,206
It's my fault…

228
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,419
that this happened to Jihyo.

229
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,756
Go back home for now.

230
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,552
There's nothing
either one of us can do right now.

231
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,184
How am I supposed to know
what those lunatics are really thinking?

232
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,064
That's all I've heard from Sister Seo.

233
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,484
And only a few people
from the church know, for now.

234
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,075
Don't try so hard.
It's already been uploaded to the cloud.

235
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,454
You should have been more careful.

236
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:19,001
Now do as I say, or your church buddies
will be very disappointed in you.

237
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,545
We are saving Jihyo together.

238
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
DON'T DRIVE STRAIGHT

239
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,050
Clean in flesh and spirit.

240
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,719
You are the Light in the darkness.

241
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,721
May your Light be used…

242
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,058
Ms. Hong.
Do you want me to tell you an old story?

243
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,186
There was once a woman just like you.

244
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,148
Everyone pointed their fingers
and called her crazy.

245
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,403
She also saw things that others could not.

246
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,864
Eventually, she could even hear things.

247
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,659
But one day,

248
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,956
she began to write down
all the things she saw and heard.

249
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,291
Word by word.

250
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,961
She never gave up.

251
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,397
She didn't doubt herself

252
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,483
or the things she heard and saw.

253
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,986
Even until the very end.

254
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,405
And everyone came to know

255
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,906
that the woman

256
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,450
was not crazy.

257
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,829
We will escape from this prison…

258
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,083
This is all of her writings organized.

259
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,713
While we were at it, we fixed it slightly
to make it easier to understand,

260
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,383
and it became a religion.

261
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,094
Who is that person?

262
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,639
I'm sure you've met her before.

263
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,891
You came into our house before, right?

264
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
You saw everything there.

265
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,854
The prophecies made by my wife.

266
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,022
Back Yoonsun?

267
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,023
Yes.

268
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,486
She was a special case among those
who came in contact with them.

269
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,488
Just like you.

270
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,866
What do you mean by "contact"?

271
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,621
In middle school, in the field of reeds.

272
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
You don't remember, right?

273
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,793
You don't remember
what exactly happened back then.

274
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,339
It was probably then.

275
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,426
That's when you came in contact with them.

276
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
"Them"?

277
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,434
Photon-based
information aggregation system.

278
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,480
But people

279
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,649
just call them aliens.

280
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,068
What?

281
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,572
You don't need to be so surprised.
It's actually pretty common.

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,993
It's just that no one remembers
their encounter with aliens.

283
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,455
Wait a second…

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,000
Aliens?

285
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,585
What do you mean?

286
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,254
That never happened to me. I just…

287
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,299
Yeah, back then, I just sniffed glue and…

288
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,467
I just sniffed glue…

289
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:18,889
CHAMISUL

290
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,850
I just

291
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
sniffed glue…

292
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,646
What is it?

293
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,606
Is your memory faint?

294
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,983
Just that moment?

295
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,777
Ms. Hong.

296
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,654
You

297
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,699
came here so you could find that memory.

298
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:42,079
Those aliens want you to do just that.

299
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,831
What are you talking about?

300
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,500
I just came here to find Siguk!

301
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,668
No, you didn't!

302
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,879
You know that's not true.

303
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,881
What?

304
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,803
Did you really come
and risk your life to find a man?

305
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,972
A man you don't even love?

306
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,474
What was your plan?

307
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,145
Marry him, have a baby,
and live happily ever after?

308
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,773
Do you really think that's your mission?

309
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,525
To live such a petty life?

310
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,158
What mission?

311
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,828
What in the world do you want me to do?

312
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,456
You must retrieve your memory.

313
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,210
What you saw and heard in the field
back in middle school.

314
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,589
Every single thing!

315
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,591
I'll help you.

316
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,845
Only then can you also help others.

317
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,518
So,

318
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,606
what does this have to do with you?

319
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,858
It has to do with all of us.

320
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,571
Whatever's in your memory…

321
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,369
will bring salvation to us all.

322
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,622
What?

323
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,085
Salvation?

324
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,005
-Chanwoo.
-Yes.

325
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,965
You know Longinus, right?

326
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,468
Longinus, the centurion.

327
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,845
The one from Mom's book.

328
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,263
Ah, yes, of course.

329
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
I know about him.

330
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,766
You know,

331
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,268
out of all the prophecies in her book,

332
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,354
I liked his story the most.

333
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,941
When the Messiah
is wandering in the wilderness,

334
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:38,070
Longinus sends an army
to bring back the Messiah.

335
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,074
It's the last part of the book, yes?
The highlight of the book.

336
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,575
That's right.

337
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,620
Isn't it just so wonderful?

338
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
Sella.

339
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,083
Sella.

340
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,253
But why did you bring that up?

341
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,421
The thing is,

342
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,134
I once thought I could be Longinus.

343
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,679
-What do you mean…
-Funny, right?

344
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,848
Gosh, it's just…

345
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,894
I was under that undeserved delusion
for a while. Jeez…

346
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,065
Gosh. Why do I feel like this? Seriously.

347
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,654
Such a great thing has happened.
I should be happy about it.

348
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,241
She came and found me first
at my real estate agency.

349
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,119
But I didn't recognize her.

350
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,498
I bet she probably wouldn't even care
about someone as insignificant as me.

351
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,709
All Seo Hwajung will ever be is

352
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,044
a girl who cuts apples for Mom, right?

353
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,929
-Why don't you try meeting her?
-Who?

354
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,389
Her.

355
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,560
Meet her?

356
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,979
Me?

357
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,649
Go and see her, talk to her.

358
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,736
In other words, you could get to know her.

359
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,199
I'll go with you if it's too difficult.

360
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,120
You're crazy!

361
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,789
If Dad finds out, he'll be furious!

362
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,166
Then we just won't get caught.

363
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,501
You think so?

364
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,838
Dad can't be there all hours of the day.

365
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,841
That's true.

366
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,762
And the people who work there
are all loyal to you.

367
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,223
You're right.

368
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,060
"The events of the future
will not be recorded further.

369
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,980
For the one who comes after
will show you firsthand."

370
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,274
History after the Messiah's arrival

371
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,735
will be made by our own hands
from here on.

372
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,822
Whether you catch her attention or not
will be up to you.

373
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,116
Chanwoo, if it wasn't for you,

374
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,619
how would I have kept going to church?

375
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,922
Do you actually remember what happened?

376
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,050
Do you clearly remember?

377
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,177
Hey, I was unconscious then.

378
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,850
Ms. Hong?

379
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,811
Ms. Hong.

380
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,480
You should sleep lying down.
Why are you sitting up?

381
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:25,070
Well, did you think about what I said?

382
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,118
Try it.

383
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
Pardon?

384
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,748
Try it.

385
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,333
I don't know what it is,

386
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,836
but try retrieving my memory.

387
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,298
You made a wise decision.

388
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:50,011
There's no need to think of it
as something too complicated.

389
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,931
It's basically the same
as regular hypnotherapy.

390
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,601
This VR is just to help you
immerse yourself.

391
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,228
Here you go.

392
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,027
There.

393
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:15,370
I know that I am nothing compared to him.

394
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:20,459
But please think of it
as a session with Ma Hyungwoo.

395
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,004
It's important to build trust
between the two of us.

396
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,945
We can't continue like this.

397
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,738
She's resisting too much.

398
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,828
Should I take out the chip?

399
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
Do it.

400
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,542
It can result in nerve damage.

401
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,460
Discard her after the surgery.

402
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,003
We don't need the body.

403
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,380
Is that really okay?

404
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,131
The believers might disagree.

405
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,635
Don't mind them.

406
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,804
Messiahs are messiahs

407
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,306
because

408
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,684
they are martyred.

409
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,020
Then I'll get ready.

410
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,991
You've been through a lot.

411
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,577
It's all over now.

412
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,886
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

413
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,687
Why did you open the trunk? Are we there?

414
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,481
Come out.

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,318
Where are we?

416
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,570
Downtown Jeonju. Get out and wait here.

417
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,615
I'm supposed to meet Sister Seo
and go in with her.

418
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,284
I told you I'm going too.
I can just stay hidden in here.

419
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,745
Stop this nonsense. Just come out, please!

420
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,122
Everyone there already knows your face.

421
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,543
We're not rescuing her today.
I'll only be collecting information.

422
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,129
Fuck. There you go again,
frustrating as hell.

423
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,547
Then what do I do here?

424
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,299
You want me to twiddle my thumbs and wait?

425
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,968
Please stop trying to do anything.

426
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,722
I get scared to death
every time you do something.

427
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,354
Huh?

428
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,666
MOTORCYCLE RENTALS

429
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,463
Are we in the right place?

430
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,756
I'm wondering that myself.

431
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,343
Seriously, is there even a hospital here?
Where are we?

432
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,428
Come on.

433
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:45,515
Why do men hate the GPS lady so much?
Why don't you ever listen to her?

434
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,685
Oh, would you please stop nagging me?
I'm begging you!

435
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,646
Why did you come with me?
I told you to go to work.

436
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,066
Do you think I can go to work
in this situation?

437
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
What's your relationship
with Jihyo anyway?

438
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,409
What? I already told you. We're soul ma--

439
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,287
Soul mates. Yes, I get that.

440
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,914
But do friends usually go this far
for each other?

441
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,583
You even took off work.

442
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,753
You must have never heard
of the word "loyal."

443
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,588
In a moment, turn left.

444
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,674
No, it's not an issue of loyalty.
I'm loyal too, but…

445
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,594
-Look over there. There.
-What?

446
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,220
Isn't that it?

447
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,388
What is that?

448
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,639
Is that a hospital?

449
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,391
It looks more like a prison.

450
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,022
What's the problem?

451
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,107
We are currently
restricting entry for visitors.

452
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,358
Please turn back and leave.

453
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,194
Yes, thank you. I'm a police officer.

454
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,278
Yes.

455
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,116
I'd like to ask a few things
regarding a case I am investigating.

456
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,327
I can go in for a bit, right?

457
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,706
I'm sorry, but what case
are you talking about?

458
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,295
Oh, well…

459
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,590
Well…

460
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,342
An assault case.

461
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:03,927
-What?
-Pardon?

462
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,890
Do you know about the mugging
that happened in the neighboring town?

463
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,643
One of the witnesses claimed
a patient here was the assailant.

464
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,354
Someone escaped from here, and bam!

465
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,647
Mugged the victim and ran.

466
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,817
Mugging…

467
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,610
An escapee?

468
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,029
-No one escapes from this hospital--
-Gosh, we know.

469
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,907
We know it's not true.
You all are probably doing a great job.

470
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,160
But we still need to follow
the procedures and check.

471
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,662
We'll be quick.

472
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,252
PUBLIC OFFICIAL
KIM BYUNGJO

473
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,045
This is Security Team Two.

474
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,506
The police are here.

475
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,550
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

476
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,054
-Joseph!
-Huh?

477
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,138
Sister Seo?

478
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,641
You've been working so hard!

479
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,810
Gosh. How long has it been?

480
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,647
But Sister Seo, what brings you here?

481
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,278
Work and faith are all powered by food.

482
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,864
What is all of this…

483
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,492
Kimchi, seasoned vegetables…

484
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,329
Ah, right.
I should introduce you guys. Chanwoo.

485
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,415
Oh, no. Mr. Kim.

486
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,666
Yes.

487
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,086
This is the team leader Kim Chanwoo.
He just recently joined.

488
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,338
This is Brother Joseph.

489
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,969
Light be with you.

490
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,804
Ah, yes.

491
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,222
Light be with you.

492
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,896
But Sister, why are you here again?

493
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,733
I just came to see her face.

494
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,904
The one in there.

495
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,821
I see.

496
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,949
But did the elders give their approval?

497
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,867
Hey!

498
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,745
-Are you serious?
-But if I get caught…

499
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,914
Dad isn't even here anyway.

500
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,083
I'll just stay in there quietly
and leave quietly!

501
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,170
Please let me see her face just once.

502
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,672
We want to experience her grace too.

503
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,468
My shift ends at quarter to,

504
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,553
so I'll give you five minutes.

505
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,514
Come on. Just a little longer.

506
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,184
Fine, I'll give you ten minutes.

507
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:17,644
Gosh.

508
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,271
You can't tell anyone about this, Sister.

509
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,870
Sorry, but only one person may visit.

510
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,415
What kind of rule is that?

511
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,541
Only one person…

512
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,670
But we traveled all the way here.

513
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
No, it's fine, Sister.

514
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,090
You go in.

515
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,633
Really?

516
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,053
I'll wait here for you.

517
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:52,971
Oh!

518
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:54,639
Good luck!

519
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,391
Thank you.

520
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,561
I can do it.

521
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,988
Compared to the outside,
the inside is pretty normal.

522
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,241
I thought there would be people
smashing their heads

523
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,993
against the walls and screaming.

524
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,453
Ms. Oh.

525
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,581
Don't ever do that again.

526
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,167
What? What did I do?

527
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,004
You lied to the security guard earlier.

528
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,633
You could end up ruining your life
for posing as a public official and all.

529
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,885
But we got inside because of it.

530
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,262
So?

531
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,848
It's good that you came with me, right?

532
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,934
Excuse me.

533
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,769
-Are you the police officers?
-Yes.

534
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,064
We got the call from the front gate.
May I ask what brought you here?

535
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,649
Yes, thank you so much.

536
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,735
Is there a person here
by the name of Moon Hyungtae?

537
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,528
I heard he was the chairman.

538
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,657
He's not here at the moment.
Is there a reason you're looking for him?

539
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:59,203
I have a few questions to ask him,
but I don't have his contact information.

540
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,873
If you could give me his phone number…

541
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,084
I can't give you
the chairman's personal phone number.

542
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,127
I'm so sorry.

543
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,171
Come on. It's just a phone num--

544
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,673
-Ma'am. Do you know Hong Jihyo?
-Hey!

545
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,719
Hong Jihyo. A woman about my age.

546
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,262
Did she happen to come here?

547
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,722
-Hello?
-Hold on.

548
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,224
-Ms. Oh.
-I'll show you a photo.

549
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,184
What are you doing?

550
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,478
This is her.

551
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,938
What is that creature?

552
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,358
-Is it too much?
-"Is it too much"?

553
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,778
Wait a moment,
I'll show you a different photo.

554
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,821
Where is it?

555
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,169
Oh my!

556
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,296
You're going through so much.

557
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,215
Your Holiness!

558
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,594
Bringing salvation to the world
is not an easy task.

559
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,762
Right?

560
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,474
Goodness me.

561
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,483
-Brother.
-Yes, Mr. Kim.

562
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,276
I'm sorry, but where's the bathroom?

563
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,237
Oh, it's this way.

564
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,114
Okay. Thank you.

565
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,991
Now I get it.

566
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,620
You wasted four years
with that kind of attitude

567
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,664
because it wasn't urgent.

568
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,415
Because you needed to be careful.

569
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,719
What did you do, Dad?

570
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,431
You didn't do anything.

571
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,059
Where were you?

572
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,062
When Grandma died,

573
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,398
what did you do?

574
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,569
What did you do?

575
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,494
I made this all myself
with the ingredients

576
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,705
provided by the church.

577
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:10,334
Try to come to your senses
and have some, please.

578
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,502
Won't you?

579
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,465
How did such a young person

580
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,302
come to carry such a heavy burden?

581
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,682
You scared me!

582
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,768
Please excuse me.

583
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,689
What, why?

584
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,524
I have to leave already?

585
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,195
It's well past ten minutes.
I'll be in big trouble if I get caught.

586
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,988
I just laid out all the food!

587
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,825
We should let Her Holiness
enjoy some meat.

588
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,370
She'll get sick
by only eating hospital food!

589
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,582
Huh?

590
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,968
-Your--
-Shut up!

591
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,387
-Oh, Light!
-Be quiet!

592
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,474
-Your--
-Don't say a word!

593
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,725
Don't say a word!

594
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,811
Your…

595
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,979
Don't say a word!

596
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,153
Ms. Oh.

597
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,490
Please just be quiet when I'm talking.

598
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,034
Why do you keep butting in,
for God's sake?

599
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,037
Because it's frustrating to watch you!

600
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,206
"I'm sorry,
but could you give me his number?"

601
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,625
I thought you were trying to hit on her.

602
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,294
Wow! Do you have any experience
in investigating?

603
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,337
You don't!

604
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,172
When did I hit on her? When?

605
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,299
-Do you have proof?
-Why are you stuttering?

606
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,471
RESTRICTED AREA

607
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,356
What the--

608
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,860
Radio…

609
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,417
Come out.

610
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,097
Listen carefully.
There are volunteers everywhere.

611
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,436
What are you doing?

612
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,021
Mr. Kim?

613
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,107
Get it together! We have no time!

614
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,150
Yes!

615
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,527
All right, listen carefully.

616
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,655
If you want to leave this place,
you must follow my instructions.

617
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,282
Can you do that?

618
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,840
This is the security office.
All personnel report to the front desk.

619
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,676
I repeat.
All personnel report to the front desk.

620
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,272
She has a knife to his throat.

621
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,611
Knife. A knife to his throat.

622
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,737
Move out of the way!

623
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,823
Brothers and Sisters!

624
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,450
Move out of the way!

625
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,993
Her Holiness?

626
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,538
Her Holiness is enraged!

627
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,792
I don't know the reason either.

628
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,131
Please don't kill me!

629
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,300
No! Chanwoo!

630
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,764
Chanwoo! Gosh!
Why are you doing this, Your Holiness?

631
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,266
Hey! Don't do anything!

632
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,936
Don't do anything ridiculous.
Don't move. Don't do it!

633
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,231
If there's even a single scratch
on Chanwoo's body,

634
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,649
you're dead!

635
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,529
-Car. My car.
-What?

636
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,696
Car. My car.

637
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,573
-What?
-Car.

638
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,409
My car! My…

639
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:16,330
Her Holiness says she wants my car!

640
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,624
Give it to her!

641
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,459
Give it to her, quickly!

642
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,461
Yeah! That's right!

643
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,547
Bring it to the hospital entrance!

644
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,173
It's an i40, 3991.

645
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,009
-An i40, 3991.
-Three-nine-one-one!

646
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,345
-An i40!
-Three-nine-nine-one, i40!

647
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,097
Three-nine-nine-one, i40!

648
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,598
Three-nine-nine-one!

649
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,934
Three-nine-nine-one, i40!

650
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,019
Yeah! 3991!

651
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,354
Hey, hurry!

652
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,689
What are you doing?

653
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,399
You, run!

654
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
Do it quickly!

655
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,780
Move!

656
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,073
You wanna get hurt?

657
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,283
Hey!

658
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,242
Your Holiness!

659
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,873
O Light, lead us away
from the traps of quarrels and hatred

660
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,624
and direct us toward your Light.

661
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,209
Chanwoo!

662
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,296
I'm the experienced one
in this field. Got it?

663
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,922
-Yes.
-If you don't listen…

664
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,382
I'll kill him!

665
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,676
-Ah, please--
-I'm going to kill him! Move!

666
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:12,928
Huh?

667
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,474
Jihyo?

668
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,058
Drive!

669
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,605
Hey!

670
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:27,985
-Get them! Quickly!
-Stop!

671
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,445
Get them!

672
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,988
Catch them! Let's go!

673
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,239
Get them!

674
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,660
Oh no! No!

675
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,037
Hold on tight!

676
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,464
Jihyo!

677
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,760
DO NOT ENTER

678
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,600
Duck!

679
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,269
Your Holiness.

680
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,229
Why are you doing this?

681
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,071
-Get them!
-Get them!

682
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,953
Where did she go?

683
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,330
-Where did she go?
-Where did they go?

684
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,540
Go up! Go!

685
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,875
-Stop!
-Some should go down.

686
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,169
Stop right there!

687
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,298
Don't move!

688
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,300
Police! I'm a police officer!

689
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,135
Police!

690
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,303
Police.

691
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,721
I'm from the police.

692
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,601
Dammit.

693
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,610
This is Sergeant Kim Byungjo
from Seoul Geoan Station.

694
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,527
A…

695
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,823
An abductee has escaped
from New Hope Psychiatric Hospital,

696
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,701
located in Jeonwon-gu, Jeonju.
Please send backup fast.

697
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,702
Yes.

698
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,206
What?

699
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,438
Hey.

700
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,106
-Yes, ma'am.
-Split into two groups.

701
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,441
You go this way. You, that way.

702
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,734
-Yes, ma'am.
-Understood.

703
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,950
Security Team One.

704
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,863
It's me.

705
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,577
Bora.

706
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:07,996
Bora.

707
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,552

708
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,159
Dad?

709
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,863
Dammit, again with this guy?

710
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,035
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

711
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,580
Bora, hit me.

712
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,165
Huh?

713
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,584
Just hit me once. Quickly. Now.

714
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,003
-What the hell are you--
-Now!

715
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,715
-No! Why would I hit you?
-Why not?

716
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,467
I've hit you before. Why can't you hit me?

717
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,177
I've beaten you. Why won't you hit me?

718
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,845
Just hit me!

719
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,936
Did it hurt?

720
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,245
Bora…

721
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,998
Bora…

722
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,585
I thought I was going to die.

723
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,838
Jeez, you crazy girl.

724
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,258
Bora…

725
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:54,997
How is it? Does it fit?

726
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,623
Yeah.

727
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,458
It's not bad.

728
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,095
Does that hurt?

729
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,222
Huh?

730
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,516
No, not really.

731
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,060
So, what is that?

732
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,563
What on earth did they do to you there?

733
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,359
Bora.

734
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,405
There's somewhere I have to go right now.

735
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,594
Oh God!

736
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,720
What's with you?

737
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,388
Sorry it's so late.

738
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,015
Is that the dude?

739
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,518
Who are you?

740
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,853
Jihyo's friend.

741
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,106
Doc, can you do me a favor?

742
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,196
Hypnotize me so I can retrieve a memory.

743
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,282
It's a really important memory.

744
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,034
I need to find it.

745
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:28,006
You're now floating through outer space.

746
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,636
You're sleepy

747
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,721
and comfortable

748
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,808
in your own personal space.

749
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,605
How am I breathing?

750
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,650
You just are.

751
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,821
Am I wearing some kind of space suit?

752
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,573
Just use your imagination. Okay?

753
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,616
You can imagine.

754
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,410
Do you really know how to do this?

755
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,414
Now, on the count of three,

756
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,915
you will see

757
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,501
a door appear in front of you.

758
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,836
All right, focus.

759
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,254
One.

760
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,340
Two.

761
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:11,967
Three.

762
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:15,554
Do you

763
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,055
see the door?

764
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,725
Yes.

765
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:41,246
Beyond that door
is a memory waiting for you.

766
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,789
One that you had long forgotten.

767
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,208
The memory of that day.

768
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,461
On the count of three,

769
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,714
you will open that door.

770
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,132
One.

771
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,134
Two.

772
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,095
Three.

773
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,350
Did the door open?

774
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,067
It won't open.

775
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,818
Look at the door again and put your hand--

776
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,487
-No…
-Open…

777
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,406
It won't open at all.

778
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,077
Take a deep breath.

779
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,787
Take a slow, deep breath.

780
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:24,873
Look at the door again and put your hand…

781
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:29,586
No, it just

782
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,756
won't budge at all.

783
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,469
And…

784
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,264
I don't really want to open it.

785
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,191
Jihyo. It's okay.

786
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,985
I'll be watching you here.

787
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,381
Ah, it tickles.

788
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,550
-Why?
-Stop it!

789
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,386
-Stop what?
-Where is your hand going?

790
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,554
You like it.

791
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,472
Ah, it tickles.

792
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,307
Gosh, I can't with you.

793
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,642
Ah, beautiful.

794
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:36,903
Were you…

795
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,865
at home?

796
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,285
Jihyo.

797
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,499
Who do you hate more?

798
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:50,917
What?

799
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,171
Between your dad and that woman,
who do you hate more?

800
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,714
I…

801
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,384
I hate myself the most.

802
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,679
Because I didn't ask any questions,

803
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,681
and I didn't say anything.

804
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,520
Hey.

805
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,772
You're not going home tonight, right?

806
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,737
Do you want to try just a sip?

807
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,907
Just a little.

808
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,284
Hey!

809
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,786
Where are you?

810
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,998
Come out right now!

811
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,416
Hey, cut it out!

812
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,754
Just come out now, you sons of bitches!

813
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,963
You aliens!

814
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,089
Gosh, stop it!

815
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,424
That's enough. Stop.

816
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,592
Ow, that hurts.

817
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,886
Let's go sleep. Good girl.

818
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,765
-One more sip.
-No! Stop drinking that.

819
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,516
-Why?
-Seriously!

820
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,809
Just a little bit!

821
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,650
-Hey!
-No, you stop drinking.

822
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,735
Ouch, my hair!

A light?

827
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,374
You see a light in the sky?

828
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,001
Yes.

829
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,045
What kind of light?

830
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,130
Starlight? Moonlight?

831
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,632
I don't think so.

832
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,260
Then what is it?

What kind of light is it?

00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,685
It's a bit strange.

835
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,520
Strange?

836
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,856
Okay, and how is it strange?

837
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,402
The light

838
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,281
is coming down to me.

839
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,283
It's so dazzling.

840
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,620
What's the situation?

841
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,996
Huh?

842
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,583
Who are you?

843
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,382
Jihyo!

844
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,550
Hey! Jihyo! Hong Jihyo!

845
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,551
Hey! Jihyo!

846
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,261
All right.

847
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,555
On the count of three,
you'll return to reality.

848
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,349
One, two, three!

849
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,226
What happened?

850
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,479
What are you doing? Wake her up!

851
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,731
Jihyo! Pull yourself together!

852
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,691
I can't move my body!

853
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,074
Huh? Wait!

854
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,201
Stop! Please stop!

855
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,664
They're… In my head!

856
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,500
They're putting something in my head!

857
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,580
