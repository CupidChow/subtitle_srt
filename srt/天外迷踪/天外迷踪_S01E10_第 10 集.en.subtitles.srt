1
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:23,732
O Light

2
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:28,528
Please take us

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,866
When this world

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,701
BLUELIGHT TRAINING CENTER

5
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,288
Turns its back on me

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,793
Your worthy Light

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,881
Is what surrounds me

8
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:53,428
The red dusk falls

9
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:58,099
On the whole world

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:03,021
My soul and body

11
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:07,484
Are trapped inside the Light

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,877
We shall be with the Light

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,592
Let us lift up

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:37,097
The cross together

15
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,101
Come to us

16
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:46,898
The Light of life

17
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:54,531
Sella

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,288
Excuse me.

19
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,206
Yes.

20
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,625
When are you going to give me the gospel?

21
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,293
He should be here soon.

22
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,506
Your Holiness!

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,175
Your Holiness! Your…

24
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,970
Your Holiness!

25
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,890
Your dress is here!

26
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,393
Dress?

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,811
This dress.

28
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,982
We had this ready

29
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,442
but no one to wear it. Goodness.

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,153
This day has finally come.

31
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,656
When you call the Light,

32
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:37,991
you gotta be, bam!

33
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,243
Dressed like this, bam!

34
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,370
-Turn on the light.
-Oh, wait.

35
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,414
I don't know about that dress.

36
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,331
What?

37
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,503
But you're going to be standing
in front of the believers.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,839
-You'll want to look--
-Forget that for now.

39
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,507
I need the ch-- Oh.

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,592
No, I mean,

41
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,927
I need to get the gospel first.

42
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,222
Please ask Father to hurry.

43
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,766
Oh, yeah.

44
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,269
Get out.

45
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,396
Get out.

46
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,440
Okay, then.

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,566
We'll do this later.

48
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,157
Your Holiness!

49
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,161
Don't you worry.

50
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,913
I'll keep your secret.

51
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,331
Secret?

52
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,208
Come on. You know what I mean.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,046
You weren't resurrected.

54
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,506
In fact,

55
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,384
you never even passed away.

56
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,054
Come on!

57
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,308
I know because we were together
on that day!

58
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,227
Oh, anyway,

59
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,147
you don't ever have to worry, okay?

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,108
This will be a secret between

61
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,736
Your Holiness and me.

62
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,171
Sella!

63
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,440
Sehee, don't you need
to go to work tomorrow?

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,693
I can just tell them
I'm going to a funeral.

65
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,113
What do you want to eat? We have coffee.

66
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,197
Dried fish snack?

67
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,074
That's mine. The dried fish.

68
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,575
It's good with coffee.

69
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,493
Say "ah."

70
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:51,749
Thank you.

71
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,211
What? You're on DC?

72
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,464
Oh, this is something Jihyo looked up.

73
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,300
Jihyo is on DC?

74
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,927
It's some sort of UFO forum.

75
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,470
A forum?

76
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,390
She's only been looking up
this kind of stuff.

77
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,853
Is this related
to what that guy said earlier?

78
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,189
About the lady
who can communicate with aliens?

79
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,649
Give me that.

80
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,109
But I'm looking at it.

81
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,487
Jihyo…

82
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,782
What in the world is on your mind?

83
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,121
-What?
-Isn't this kind of cute?

84
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,707
I didn't know
she liked this kind of stuff.

85
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,042
Unicorns?

86
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,359
Where did it go?

87
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,902
Dammit.

88
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,904
Dammit.

89
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,414
What are you up to?

90
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,249
What are you doing?

91
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,512
Hey.

92
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,765
Talk with me for a second. Hey!

93
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,185
Do you not hear me?

94
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,279
Hey. Stop for a second.

95
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,948
I said, let's talk.

96
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,825
Hey.

97
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,992
Hey!

98
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,910
Dammit.

99
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,331
You can't go in there!

100
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,251
Darn it!

101
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,168
Hey!

102
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,089
What are you doing right now?

103
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,177
It's all over.

104
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,028
Where is it?

105
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,906
It's on its way.

106
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,037
It's on its way? Huh?

107
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,040
Why is it taking so long?

108
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,631
Father.

109
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,635
Do you not want to receive salvation?

110
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,015
Everyone is waiting.

111
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,478
Ms. Hong.

112
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,481
Do you know

113
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,983
who the scariest person in the world is?

114
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,986
A person who believes in you.

115
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,070
Okay, Father.

116
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,782
Well, I appreciate your words of wisdom
and whatnot, but

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,952
when are you going to give me my chip?

118
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,750
I understand
you have a lot to say since earlier,

119
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,378
but you have to give it to me quickly
so I can bring you salvation or whatever.

120
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,599
Open it.

121
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,935
Open it.

122
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,021
It's the reason you came so far.

123
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,944
You met Her Holiness in there, right?

124
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,445
What did she say to you?

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,614
What in the world is she thinking?

126
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,865
She was resurrected?

127
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,951
She never even passed away.

128
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,912
-Why did she lie to the believers?
-You're so annoying.

129
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,455
Hey!

130
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,377
I'm confused about
what I should believe right now.

131
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,420
What is…

132
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,048
What is right?

133
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,384
Who should I believe?

134
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,970
You're close to Her Holiness.

135
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,388
Have you heard anything?

136
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,931
Hey, kid. Kid?

137
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,600
Whatever you believe
is none of my business.

138
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,687
Carry on your soul-searching by yourself
and leave me alone.

139
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,522
I'm fucking busy enough as it is.

140
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,662
UFO?

141
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,580
Father?

142
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,185
What? Where is it?

143
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,025
Where did you hide it?

144
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,861
Wow, you're still messing with me.

145
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,614
Where is my chip?

146
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,953
You really believed it, huh?

147
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,748
That you are the Messiah?

148
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,250
What?

149
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,252
Ms. Hong.

150
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:16,008
There was nothing in your head
in the first place.

151
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,013
What?

152
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,501
Hold on.

153
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,169
There's no chip?

154
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,011
You people operated on me.

155
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,055
You even made a hole in my head.

156
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,182
We did.

157
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,434
We opened you up,

158
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,436
but there was nothing there.

159
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,983
Wow, I don't get what you're saying.

160
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,028
What is that?

161
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,159
What is that?

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,454
We were not able to find

163
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:30,666
any evidence that you encountered aliens.

164
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,751
Evidence?

165
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,794
What evidence?

166
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,713
I'm telling you, I remember everything.

167
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,923
After the hypnosis,
it all came back to me!

168
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
Back in middle school,
in the field of reeds, I…

169
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,304
You were hypnotized

170
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,015
after you had met me, right?

171
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,269
If so, it's highly possible

172
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,272
that you made up those memories

173
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,774
because you were hypnotized

174
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,195
after you'd been fed
all sorts of ideas by me.

175
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,782
All of it was your imagination.

176
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,078
I fucking knew it.

177
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,664
Hey.

178
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,749
Look closely.

179
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,667
That's your god.

180
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,253
Your Father is here
to bring you salvation.

181
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,300
No.

182
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,635
Then…

183
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,514
Then, what about the hallucinations
I've been seeing all this time?

184
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,350
The devices malfunctioning.
How can you explain that?

185
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,434
Ms. Hong.

186
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,019
Do you hear that?

187
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:36,732
Out of all the people out there,

188
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,153
do you know how many have said
the same thing as you?

189
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,905
No!

190
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,491
But those things really happened to me!

191
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,159
They say the same thing.

192
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,327
At least,

193
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,955
they firmly believe it's true.

194
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,415
Ms. Hong.

195
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:59,672
If you really encountered a UFO

196
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,758
and were truly chosen by aliens,

197
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:07,596
then you would know how to call them.

198
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,932
So, can you do it?

199
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,393
Can you call them?

200
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,646
The aliens you're talking about.

201
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,192
I don't know.

202
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,694
How should I know that?

203
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,364
It's because you're not the Messiah.

204
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,203
I'm disappointed too.

205
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,165
I truly believed that, at least this time,

206
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
you were the real thing!

207
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,751
No!

208
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,837
I wanted to believe you were!

209
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
Oh, the damn Messiah.

210
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,722
Just how many years I have looked for it.

211
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,640
Huh?

212
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,249
Get her!

213
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,084
Shit!

214
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,128
Gosh, dammit!

215
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,172
Quickly!

216
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,382
-We have an intruder.
-Dammit!

217
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,344
That means it doesn't exist.

218
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,601
That means none of it exists.

219
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,104
Messiah, aliens, all of it.

220
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,858
You're saying it's all nonsense.

221
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,526
It can't be nonsense!

222
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,237
What if I come to such a conclusion?

223
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,198
If I say, after all this time,

224
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,866
that all of this is nonsense!

225
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,326
Those people out there,

226
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,162
what happens to their lives?

227
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,664
Do you have any idea

228
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,459
how long they have been waiting
for the Messiah?

229
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,003
So they can achieve the damned ascension.

230
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,005
So they can receive the damned salvation!

231
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,093
Do you know how long
they've believed and followed me?

232
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,471
You be it.

233
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,182
Please

234
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,434
be the Messiah.

235
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,688
Bring salvation to those poor people.

236
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,357
Do it perfectly, just like the prophecy!

237
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,442
Why should I?

238
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,111
You said I'm nothing.

239
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,529
Fake it, then.

240
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,280
Act it out. Put on a show!

241
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,366
Give them fake salvation.

242
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,952
We have to let them

243
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,537
at least

244
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,832
die happily!

245
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,876
No.

246
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,421
No!

247
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,214
I can't!

248
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,632
I can't lie like that!

249
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,092
You already did!

250
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,760
Even better than me.

251
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,056
You even kicked out your friend
or whoever that was!

252
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,104
No!

253
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,315
Don't you get it yet?

254
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,069
You've already walked in here
of your own accord.

255
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,364
So we're in the same boat now.

256
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,869
If we reveal now
that all of this was fake,

257
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,328
what do you think will happen?

258
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,042
Do you think
the believers will just let you go

259
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,711
when you've deceived them?

260
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,631
Ms. Hong.

261
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,558
I'm not asking you to kill yourself too.

262
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,726
I'm asking you

263
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,021
to play your part, that's all!

264
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,355
Go out there!

265
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,108
Be the Messiah.

266
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,902
No.

267
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,903
And then

268
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,739
survive alone.

269
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,867
Survive

270
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,911
and go back.

271
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,622
Go back to your life.

272
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,292
Stay away.

273
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,476
An intruder?

274
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,645
We'll have to hurry even more.

275
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,688
The Messiah is ready as well.

276
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,357
Let's start the event.

277
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,919
It's quieter than I thought.

278
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,879
I was expecting an orgy or something.

279
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,464
Gosh, that's so dirty.

280
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,341
Damn.

281
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,927
It's physically impossible
to break through this.

282
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,973
Is there any other way…

283
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,599
Mr. Direct.

284
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,978
Mr. Direct Kim…

285
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,481
What the…

286
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,191
Is Direct looking for an indirect path?

287
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,403
Huh? That's my…

288
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,654
Wait, my car.

289
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,658
My car.

290
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,703
Jeez, my bag is in that car.

291
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,665
Wait.

292
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,091
Wow!

293
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,511
Whenever Moonhole goes to buy cigarettes,
something always happens.

294
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,263
Phillip, move!

295
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
-Dammit.
-Gosh.

296
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,103
-What?
-Are those muscles just for show?

297
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,859
Fuck, it was open!

298
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,286
Dammit.

299
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,957
What's that now?

300
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,710
Wait a minute.

301
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,046
Isn't that Moonhole?

302
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,215
-What?
-Ah!

303
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,758
Dammit! Get her!

304
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,012
-Damn you, sons of bitches!
-Stop right there!

305
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,597
-Stop!
-Hey!

306
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,323
Cap, you all right?

307
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,243
Cap is Captain Korea.

308
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,994
What?

309
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,083
What?

310
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,167
How did you…

311
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,586
Why are you guys…

312
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,547
Quit smoking, would you?

313
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,758
We showed up at the perfect time.

314
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,718
What on earth is going on here?

315
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,682
What's wrong with you?

316
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,271
It was all a scam.

317
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,188
Huh?

318
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,316
Direct Kim was right. This is all a show.

319
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,651
UFOs aren't coming down.

320
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,280
Say one thing at a time.
One at a time, slowly.

321
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,200
Jihyo.

322
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,622
Everyone's gonna die! Hurry!

323
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,982
What is all this?

324
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,650
What?

325
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,777
What happened?

326
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,117
No!

327
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,201
Don't!

328
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,205
Don't.

329
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,334
Pull yourself together, Hong Jihyo!

330
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,296
Something's wrong.

331
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,716
Something's gone wrong here.

332
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,984
What am I doing here?

333
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,404
What have I been doing up until now?

334
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,116
Behold.

335
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,914
Today is the harvest of our lonely faith.

336
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,624
And it is the moment

337
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,711
that Father Light comes down to Earth!

338
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,546
And those who don't believe…

339
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,882
What were they, after all?

340
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,594
…will be greeted by Father Light,

341
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,679
and they will be judged!

342
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,181
Was I just out of my mind?

343
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,850
This moment is brought to us

344
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,436
by Her Holiness, the Messiah!

345
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,188
Let us worship her!

346
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,613
Hong Jihyo is the king…

347
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,826
The king of crazy people!

348
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,453
ABANDON YOUR CARBON BODIES
AND REACH ASCENSION AND UNITY!

349
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,599
Fuck, this will get you
a silver play button!

350
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,395
Seriously, what should I do
about that girl…

351
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,064
What is that? Is that Troll?

352
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,816
I know, right?

353
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,901
Behold.

354
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,362
Father Light

355
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,242
will answer the Messiah's call
and come down to Earth.

356
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,245
And everyone shall see the Light,

357
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,499
even those without faith.

358
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,917
What is she doing up there…

359
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,918
I'll say.

360
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,629
She looks kind of…

361
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,842
-Are you crazy? Is this funny?
-Silver play button!

362
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,763
How weird.

363
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,431
What's wrong with me?

364
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,731
Everyone on Earth

365
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:28,902
shall be judged by the divine power!

366
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,948
It shall be so!

367
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,784
It shall be so!

368
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,495
-Sella!
-Sella!

369
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,082
-Sella!
-Sella!

370
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,339
Father!

371
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,714
Silver play button!

372
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,798
It's freaking pretty.

373
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,260
Did they really come? Aliens in Korea?

374
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,761
No, you idiot!

375
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,346
Hey!

376
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,056
Get out of here!

377
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,558
Go get the car!

378
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:44,853
My car?

379
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,980
Well, Direct Kim…

380
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,233
stole it.

381
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,696
Brothers and sisters.

382
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:01,286
It's finally time to say goodbye

383
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,373
to our meaningless physical bodies!

384
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,458
-Sella!
-Sella!

385
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,135
Let's meet in paradise!

386
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,429
-Sella!
-Sella!

387
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,432
-Sella!
-Sella!

388
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,476
-Sella!
-Sella!

389
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,994
What is everyone doing?

390
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,830
Are they really trying to die?

391
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,289
Mass suicide?

392
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,791
Hey. This won't do.

393
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,127
-Hey, let's go get the car.
-What car?

394
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,545
Wait for me!

395
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,505
No.

396
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,266
No.

397
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,520
No.

398
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,522
Hold on!

399
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,860
Hold on!

400
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,071
No!

401
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,993
I'm not the Messiah!

402
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,997
It was all a lie!

403
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,169
There's no UFO coming.

404
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,673
If you eat that, you'll all die!

405
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,265
I can't bring you salvation.

406
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,271
I'm no one.

407
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,779
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,656
I'm sorry.

409
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,035
Bora, I'm sorry.

410
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,297
You've arrived at your destination.

411
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,049
Ending route guidance.

412
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,928
I think this is the right place,
but why does it look empty?

413
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,723
-I'll go.
-Yes.

414
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,523
The gate is open!

415
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,857
What a

416
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,653
strange thing to say, Your Holiness!

417
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,364
You did it!

418
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,242
With your divine power,

419
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:31,496
you summoned the Light!

420
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,539
Father L--

421
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,631
What the…

422
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,057
What's that sound?

423
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,184
Hurry up! Get in!

424
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,730
FROM FLESH TO LIGHT!
THE MESSIAH'S MEMORIAL SERVICE

425
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,405
-Abigail.
-The Light fell down.

426
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,800
Did you see that, you morons?

427
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,802
That's salvation.

428
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,140
This is salvation!

429
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,529
Honey!

430
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,741
Dad!

431
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,667
Bora!

432
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,136
Bora!

433
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,722
Because of me, you had to…

434
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,392
Be quiet. My hands are fucking shaking.

435
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,146
What's this?

436
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,274
What's going on?

437
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,369
Bora.

438
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,954
I'm sorry!

439
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,582
UFOs and aliens…

440
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,502
They don't exist here, right?
I know. I just saw it.

441
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,635
We can look for them together again.
Isn't that right?

442
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,723
Yes!

443
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,112
Dammit!

444
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,997
Dad!

445
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,595
I can't die! I can't die here!

446
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,941
It was all a lie?

447
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,902
You tricked us?

448
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:31,819
Why?

449
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,113
She's the same!

450
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,656
She's the same!

451
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,033
Get her!

452
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,453
Get her!

453
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,164
Hey! Get her!

454
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,750
Hurry!

455
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,585
Hurry up!

456
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,689
It was a lie?

457
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,570
Bora. Go, okay?

458
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,072
Why won't this open?

459
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,490
You go ahead!

460
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,491
Shut up!

461
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,535
Dammit!

462
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,331
It's done! Let's go!

463
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,541
Lies.

464
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,211
Why?

465
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,757
I'll never forgive you.

466
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,643
This is the police. Nobody move.

467
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,728
Sergeant Kim.

468
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,813
Police?

469
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,735
It doesn't matter now.

470
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,737
Kill…

471
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,490
both of them!

472
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,534
Stay away.

473
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,870
-Stay away.
-Don't move.

474
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,454
Don't move!

475
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,956
Everybody on the ground!

476
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,708
Get away.

477
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,626
Get down.

478
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,837
Stay away. Please stay away!

479
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,838
Fucking hell!

480
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,883
Here!

481
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,134
Great. Get in.

482
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,635
Get down, for fuck's sake!

483
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,515
Wait. No!

484
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,921
Hey.

485
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,255
What is that?

486
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,218
Is it a blackout?

487
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,719
Did you say "war"?

488
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,180
No. That.

489
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,819
Tayo!

490
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,378
Jihyo.

491
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,755
-Where did they go?
-They're gone.

492
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,635
What was that just now?
Captain Price, did you see that?

493
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,554
What I saw

494
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,889
is not there.

495
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,587
You…

496
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,010
You too?

497
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,014
Yeah.

498
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,765
I saw it.

499
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,741
Honey.

500
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,661
Honey!

501
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,666
Honey!

502
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,502
Honey.

503
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,087
Honey.

504
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,197
Why did you do it?

505
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,953
Why did you have to go that far?

506
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,914
I believed everything.

507
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,626
I believed everything you said
and did everything you told me.

508
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,044
All of us did.

509
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,798
Why did you have to lie so much?

510
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,510
Why deceive us--

511
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:24,888
Being quiet was your merit.

512
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,766
You never had questions.

513
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,978
I really liked that about you.

514
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,941
If you're going to shoot anyway,

515
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,527
end it quickly.

516
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,868
Take this.

517
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,496
It has your mom's number.

518
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,875
Call her.

519
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,298
And don't skip your meals.

520
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,458
Hurry!

521
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,169
Let go of me!

522
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,214
Here!

523
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,642
Come here!

524
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,778
Lovely Aunt!

525
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,074
People are injured. Requesting backup.

526
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,919
Hey, where did you guys go?

527
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,754
Moonhole, are you okay?

528
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,840
What in the world happened?

529
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,135
I'll tell you everything.

530
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,553
Everything.

531
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,724
Ms. Hong.

532
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,561
There she is.

533
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,647
Are you all right? What a mess this is.

534
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,732
Hello, yes.

535
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,859
What the…

536
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,444
Siguk.

537
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,117
Ms. Hong.

538
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,619
But what…

539
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,038
What's with your clothes?

540
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,279
And

541
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:14,076
I explained what I saw to the others.

542
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,412
But no one believed me.

543
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,666
Even though they saw it in person.

544
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,962
But one person believed me.

545
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,132
Siguk.

546
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,720
I told Siguk everything
from beginning to end.

547
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,556
He sat there and listened,

548
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,059
but when I looked at his face,

549
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,268
I knew.

550
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,562
"Oh.

551
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,648
It's over now.

552
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,609
I should go home."

553
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,948
That's the first time I thought
that I wanted to go home.

554
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:56,868
Weren't you scared?

555
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,787
How is it that you are okay now?

556
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,539
I'm not really okay.

557
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,332
Do I look okay?

558
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,835
Well…

559
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,171
So, after that?

560
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:12,426
How are things with Siguk?
Is he still staying at your house?

561
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,016
Siguk went back to where he was before.

562
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,768
But why there of all places?

563
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,603
What do you mean?

564
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,440
Why that house?

565
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,484
You really wanted to move out of there.

566
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:33,739
Well, I'm just used to it.
And I don't have money.

567
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,289
Why don't you start fresh in a new place?

568
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,542
It's just

569
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,336
all those bad things happened there.

570
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,719
Good things happened there too.

571
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,143
Right.

572
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,399
Jihyo.

573
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,234
Yeah?

574
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,736
Let's break up.

575
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,826
Didn't we…

576
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,040
Didn't I already break up with you?

577
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,210
Technically, no.

578
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,087
I didn't say yes then.

579
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,715
But I'm breaking up with you now.

580
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,096
Can I ask why?

581
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,018
I don't think I can do it.

582
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,854
I can't live with a crazy woman.

583
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,743
-Gosh!
-Hey.

584
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,703
-You said you're crazy.
-Hey!

585
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,706
Jeez!

586
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,707
Bastard.

587
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,963
Thank you.

588
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,714
For what?

589
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,221
For saying it instead of me.

590
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,393
I should've said it myself.

591
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,027
Make sure to eat well and stay healthy.

592
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,453
Dad!

593
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,040
The deposit's too expensive.
I don't have the money!

594
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,751
That's why I'm paying it for you!

595
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,087
You don't even have a job.

596
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,341
If you pay for it,
it's your house, not mine.

597
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,678
Just give in, would you?
That's the point of breaking away.

598
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,180
See?

599
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,599
Thanks, Mom.

600
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,767
No, not you.

601
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,730
Help your dad break away from you.

602
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,482
He wants to pay for it
for his peace of mind.

603
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,403
Do you have to be so desperately mature?

604
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,243
Wow, this place seems nice.

605
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,870
Here.

606
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,205
-It's nice.
-Right?

607
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:29,122
Hey.

608
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,999
Mom, it's a 30 million deposit,
900,000 rent.

609
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,543
Empty nest syndrome.
That's the world of adults.

610
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,589
Wait, did you say "Mom"?
Is that what you call her now?

611
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,884
Yeah.

612
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,888
It's been about 15 years
since we became a family.

613
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,389
But

614
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:51,061
trying to have a conversation
without saying "Mom"

615
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,189
was too hard.

616
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,152
Anyway, you said
everything fell back in place.

617
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,821
But it doesn't seem like
that's totally true.

618
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,573
Really?

619
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,244
Well, if you look at it like that,
I guess you're right.

620
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,290
This is a training center near Gyeonggi-do
where a cult called Divine Light Church

621
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,584
held a gathering last weekend.

622
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:20,507
The scene showed signs of commotion,
and strange pipes were spotted.

623
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,261
The church members had hallucinations
caused by toxic fumes,

624
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,847
and some claimed they saw
an unidentified flying object.

625
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,933
I met Him at last.

626
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,643
Who did you meet?

627
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,436
UFO.

628
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,106
UFO, our Father.

629
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,317
They all seemed insane!

630
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,362
Everyone running around crying
with their eyes rolled back…

631
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,241
This incident could have ended
in a mass suicide,

632
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,869
but there were no innocent victims,
and everyone was safely rescued.

633
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,456
The police arrested the leaders
of this movement

634
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,043
and have begun investigating
the power outage that affected the whole--

635
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,338
It's this exact moment. Do you see this?

636
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,508
If it were a normal power outage,
this couldn't have happened.

637
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,553
In other words, the cause of this blackout

638
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,974
can only be seen as the result
of a glitch caused by aliens.

639
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,976
That is our assumption.

640
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,394
I filmed this video.

641
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,396
Any questions?

642
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,316
Yes.

643
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:21,276
Mr. Shitty Stocks Lover.

644
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,323
So, when will you play the UFO footage?

645
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,659
I'm telling you this over and over again.

646
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,995
This is not free. You have to pay.

647
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,748
I mean, think about it!

648
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,000
How do you take a video
with a malfunctioning phone?

649
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,209
It was a glitch.

650
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,337
I mean,

651
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,340
you're just telling us you saw it.

652
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,924
There's got to be a reason for--

653
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,093
Stop looking for a reason! Stop.

654
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,555
There are few things in this world
that happen because of a reason.

655
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,850
-Then, tell us more about the scene.
-Lovely Aunt, hi.

656
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,603
How did the UFO appear and then disappear?

657
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,772
That's a very interesting question.

658
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,148
Who are these people?

659
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,442
Total newbies on our forum.

660
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,445
Phillip is gonna choose one of them
to become a mod.

661
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:09,282
There are encounters of the first,
second, third, and fourth kinds.

662
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,785
-I need to explain all of this…
-What about Bora?

663
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,204
I don't know. Probably upstairs.

664
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,207
Let's watch the video first. Donghyuk.

665
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,418
They're trying to figure out
the extent of the damage.

666
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:22,587
Next is related news.

667
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,423
Kim, who was arrested
for murdering Moon Hyungtae,

668
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,843
the leader of Divine Light Church
who instigated the mass suicide attempt,

669
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,930
has been sent to prosecution
on murder and other charges.

670
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,184
Kim confessed to the police
that he had harbored ill feelings

671
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,686
towards Moon due to religious differences,

672
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,356
which seems to be the reason
for his offense.

673
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,068
Is that the person who encountered aliens?

674
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:53,868
There are many eyewitness accounts
of unidentified creatures.

675
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,790
Out of those, we will look into Bigfoot,
the one with the most sightings recently.

676
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:03,044
Now, let's look into the truth
behind this creature.

677
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,756
-Hong Kong, 1945.
-Oh, you're here.

678
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,925
-A German archaeologist…
-What are you doing?

679
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,844
Researching my next piece.

680
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,638
What do you think?

681
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:14,889
What?

682
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,474
Isn't that the…

683
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,642
Bigfoot.

684
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,644
This creature has very large teeth…

685
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,770
I heard that was fake.

686
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,816
The video is fake, but Bigfoot is not.

687
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,819
Isn't it in the US or something?

688
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,279
You're gonna go all the way there?

689
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,948
We thought UFOs were only in the US too.

690
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,409
That's how the ancient creature
called Bigfoot…

691
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,577
That's true.

692
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:41,583
I'm sure many of you
have heard of Bigfoot.

693
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,502
This furry giant,
famously known as Bigfoot,

694
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:48,756
has many names depending
on the country or location it appears in.

695
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,553
These creatures are usually
2.5-meters tall.

696
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:58,683
Their body is covered with long hair,
and they almost look like gorillas.

697
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,814
The video you're watching
was filmed in northern California in 1967.

698
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,484
It's the most famous Bigfoot video
in existence.

699
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,610
Hey.

700
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,612
You don't watch pro baseball anymore?

701
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,114
You were a baseball fan in middle school.

702
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,493
That's what I thought too.

703
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,163
But after the Unicorns disbanded,
I lost interest.

704
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,915
That's when I realized

705
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,084
that I wasn't into baseball.

706
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,253
I just liked that team.

707
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,801
-What?
-Huh?

708
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:38,097
You're making it super freaking obvious
that you have something to say.

709
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,601
Do you like loft apartments?

710
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,311
What?

711
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,396
Do you want to live with me?

712
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,440
What are you saying,

713
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,067
all of a sudden?

714
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,401
Hang on.

715
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,569
I, uh,

716
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,322
I made a list of some houses on sale.

717
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,120
Do you want to read it?

718
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,209
Do you

719
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,795
want to read it?

720
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,815
Hey, Moonhole!

721
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,610
What?

722
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,612
Move your scooter while I'm asking nicely.

723
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:36,489
Dammit.

724
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,626
I told you not to park there!
It's for the customers!

725
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,503
All right. I'm coming, you punk!

726
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:51,921
Hurry!

727
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,097
How are your hallucinations these days?

728
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,182
Hallucinations?

729
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,853
The alien with the Unicorns cap.

730
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,272
That's why you came here
in the first place.

731
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,695
Right.

732
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,825
Right, the Unicorns.

733
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:24,704
Do you remember

734
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,373
when I hypnotized you in here?

735
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,042
Yeah.

736
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,628
What in the world did you see then?

737
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,547
Was that a hallucination too?

738
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,725
Sturgeon?

739
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,560
Sturgeon?

740
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,399
I saw a documentary once.

741
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,736
My dad had it on while he was sleeping.

742
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,239
In the documentary,
there were these scientists

743
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,076
who were rescuing sturgeon.

744
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,454
You know how they get stuck and die

745
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,499
in the nets discarded by humans?

746
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,795
The scientists take them out,
untangle them, and save them.

747
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,713
That's what they do.

748
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:16,881
And?

749
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,926
And before they let them go,

750
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,137
they insert an electronic tag
on their backs.

751
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,600
Then they're able to track
all the sturgeon's movements.

752
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,893
Like a transmitter.

753
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,356
Those people

754
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:35,858
just wanted to know.

755
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,861
"Yes.

756
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,613
Go wherever you please.

757
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,531
Yes."

758
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:46,619
"Live freely. However you want."
And then they let them go.

759
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,123
Because they wanted to understand…

760
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,210
how far this creature could go.

761
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,629
The sturgeon?

762
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,216
The sturgeon.

763
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,217
So?

764
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:04,095
How far did that sturgeon go?

765
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:23,085
