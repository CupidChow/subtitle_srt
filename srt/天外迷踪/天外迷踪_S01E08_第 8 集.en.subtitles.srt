1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,010
Hey, Jihyo. Pull yourself together.

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,094
It's white…

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,346
White?

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,348
White all around me.

5
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,227
Everything is white.

6
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,274
There are no walls.

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,693
There's no floor.

8
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,362
But

9
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,490
they chose me!

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,867
They?

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,118
It's the same

12
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,954
as Back Yoonsun's interview.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,208
-Jihyo, listen to me.
-Okay.

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,211
-What do they want from you?
-Th…

15
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,130
What did they put in your head?

16
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,257
They are

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,218
speaking to me.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,055
Speaking? What are they speaking? Korean?

19
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,100
Hey, say that again.

20
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,480
What?

21
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,065
Hey, Jihyo! Jihyo!

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,107
-Jihyo!
-Hey, Jihyo!

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,817
Hey, snap out of it! Hey!

24
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,078
Wait, what…

25
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,666
what does this mean?

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,294
It means you've made contact with aliens.

27
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,588
The day you disappeared
back in middle school

28
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,799
at our hideout in the field of reeds.

29
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,718
That's when you met aliens.

30
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
What?

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,025
Hey, Bora.

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,112
Did you know everything?

33
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,030
Yeah.

34
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,501
I went to your house
after you left the hospital.

35
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,713
I went there to tell you everything.

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,594
Oh…

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,222
Hey.

38
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,976
Do you really not remember anything?

39
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,814
You know, the things you saw
and heard during hypnosis.

40
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,149
Nothing?

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
I can't really remember.

42
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,156
Only the time that I was with you

43
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,242
in the field of reeds.

44
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,834
Field of reeds…

45
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,630
Do you want to go there?

46
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,508
Huh?

47
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,509
There.

48
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,386
If I go there in person,

49
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,598
maybe something might come to mind.

50
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,061
Let's go.

51
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:08,938
Huh?

52
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,857
Oh, Doc…

53
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,859
Thank you so much for today.

54
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,445
Sorry for coming so late. We'll get going.

55
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,404
Let's go.

56
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,655
-Bye!
-Hey.

57
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,240
-Thank you!
-Jihyo, hold on! Wait!

58
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,409
A minute, please.

59
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,955
I'll be smoking downstairs.

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,181
Sit down for a second.

61
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm really sorry, but I can't talk long.

62
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,854
-What was that earlier?
-I'll tell you everything later.

63
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay?

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,981
I'm really sorry.

65
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,899
I have to go.

66
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,234
Hey, Jihyo. Hong Jihyo!

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,319
I really don't have time!

68
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,906
This is serious.
Do you want to go to the hospital?

69
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,785
Not here, a real hospital
where you can get a proper consultation.

70
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,413
No.

71
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,375
I'm sick and tired of hospitals.

72
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,502
I'm leaving.

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,462
Hey, Jihyo!

74
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,340
Jihyo! Hong Jihyo!

75
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
Hey, Jihyo!

76
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,553
Where are you?

77
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,305
Answer me, please!

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,620
Fucking hell. Hold on a second.

79
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,125
Was…

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,918
Was our hideout around here?

81
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,087
Yeah.

82
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,255
Yeah, I think so.

83
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,216
So the place I found the camera was…

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,179
around there?

85
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,222
Fuck, is it not?

86
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,642
Gosh. Is this even the right spot?

87
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,686
Bora, I'm sorry.

88
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,855
What?

89
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,315
For what?

90
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,442
For slapping you back then.

91
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,945
Piss off.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,405
It's fine.

93
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,116
Well, we're even now anyway.

94
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,372
I really hated you then.

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,045
I thought that the reason my family
fell apart was because of you.

96
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,470
Even the hallucinations.

97
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,016
I thought it was
because of you and your glue.

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,269
I thought it was
because you gave me alcohol.

99
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,562
All this time.

100
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,147
But that wasn't true.

101
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,566
No, it wasn't.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,720
I wonder what it was.

103
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,310
You said the aliens said something to you.

104
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,606
What in the world did they say?

105
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,030
Is there anything else you can think of?

106
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,158
Anything before or after that?

107
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,242
My dad.

108
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,202
What?

109
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,204
My dad told me something.

110
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,294
After I came back,

111
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,046
I was in the hospital for a while,
you know.

112
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,924
At the hospital,

113
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,676
while I was in a daze,

114
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,138
he said
I was rambling gibberish to myself.

115
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,264
Gibberish?

116
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,600
Do you think those ramblings

117
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,228
might be connected to what I heard…

118
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,648
from the aliens?

119
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,821
Bora, let me use your phone.

120
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh…

121
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,686
Hello?

122
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,855
Dad, it's Jihyo…

123
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,443
Dad, just calm down!

124
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,404
No, I was going to call you,

125
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,074
but I wasn't in a situation where I could.

126
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,493
Yes, well…

127
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,744
Yes, I'll go home.

128
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,664
I'm going to go home,
but right now is a little…

129
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,581
What?

130
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,000
What did you say?

131
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,190
Give me back…

132
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,483
Emergency hospitalization?

133
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,901
You bastards!

134
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:34,031
No, I mean, why is she acting like this?
And why here?

135
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,159
We're seeing this
as symptoms of schizophrenia.

136
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,747
Paranoia, hallucinations,
language breakdown, et cetera.

137
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,583
She's a textbook example.

138
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,752
We were able to get her information
with the help of the local police.

139
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,296
You can check with them.

140
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,463
So, Ms. Hong did this?

141
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,675
I ask that you find her as soon as you can
and take protective action.

142
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,636
As you can see,
she is a highly dangerous case.

143
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,848
Yes, well, understood. Yes.

144
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,484
There's something fishy.

145
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,114
Things aren't matching up.

146
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,825
No, rather, they're matching up too well.

147
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,076
Right.

148
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,579
Let's say Jihyo was crazy
and went on a rampage.

149
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,832
Why would she do that here?
Why all the way out here?

150
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,709
I know that person earlier.

151
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,086
Who?

152
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,380
The person Ms. Hong was holding on to.

153
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,343
He came with Ms. Hong to the station
because of an assault case.

154
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,719
Assault?

155
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,346
Jihyo assaulted him?

156
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,182
He's also from this church, you know.

157
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,481
I think even the police here is fishy.

158
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,445
Yes, Detective Kim Byungjo--

159
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,409
Yes, I'll be right there. Yes.

160
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,137
Don't worry about this too much.

161
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,599
We'll take care of it.
Everything is going to be fine.

162
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,768
Please make certain of that.

163
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,123
Hey, Jihyo.

164
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,500
Stop right there!

165
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,584
What?

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,552
Don't go in.

167
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,553
Why?

168
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,972
Think about it, the timing of this.

169
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,599
Isn't it way too freaking weird?

170
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,017
How so?

171
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,853
He comes back now?

172
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,021
As soon as you escape from there?

173
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,859
Isn't this some sort of trap?

174
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,820
Are you sure it was your dad on the phone?

175
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,823
I'm sure of it.

176
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,116
It was my dad's voice.

177
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
What if he is being held by them too?

178
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,717
For crying out loud.

179
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,844
Hey, Jihyo.

180
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:42,887
Jihyo, hold on!

181
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,221
Why?

182
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,098
Take this.

183
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,394
Keep Discord on.

184
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,022
I'll be listening,
so if something happens, just scream.

185
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,939
Got it?

186
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,026
I'll be back.

187
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,387
Bora.

188
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
I'm inside.

189
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,233
Dad…

190
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,486
I'm home.

191
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,074
Where is he?

192
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,243
Come in.

193
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,421
Welcome home.

194
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,346
Si…

195
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,556
Siguk.

196
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,201
My home,

197
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,245
it's gone.

198
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,919
Yes, hello.

199
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,006
I'm calling about the abduction last night
at the New Hope Psychiatric Hospital.

200
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,633
I want to know how it's going.

201
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,259
Yes.

202
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,722
What? No, that can't be.

203
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,266
No.

204
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,102
Your officers came last night
and searched the place.

205
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,022
I was the one who reported it.

206
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,608
No, how…

207
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,861
How can…

208
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,324
Yes, well… Okay. I understand. Yes.

209
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,246
Wow, what the…

210
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,627
I'm saying that this isn't
a simple intimidation case.

211
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,088
So, what about this church?

212
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,841
I'm saying that
this person was not urgently hospitalized.

213
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,761
There's circumstantial evidence
that she was held illegally.

214
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,137
What are you talking about?

215
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,974
The local station confirms
the hospital checked her information.

216
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,725
It was an emergency hospitalization!

217
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,063
What?

218
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,148
Fucking assholes.

219
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,651
About this cult…

220
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:32,157
it's possible they're manipulating
the police from the inside as well.

221
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,662
If not, how could they cover it up
after I reported what I saw?

222
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,830
They're not covering…

223
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:38,998
Hey, punk.

224
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,918
Some ill patients flipped their lid,
and you're overreacting!

225
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,545
Chief, I told you that's not true!

226
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,797
Why'd you go down
to Jeonju in the first place?

227
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,092
Like I said, that's a little personal…

228
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,927
Gosh, you punk.

229
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,263
Instead of looking into
an old case like that,

230
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,682
just focus on our work!

231
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,726
Our work! Okay?

232
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,020
We're slammed
because it's crackdown season!

233
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:07,276
Anyway, the case you reported is
within Jeonju's jurisdiction anyway.

234
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,404
They'll take care of it, so let it go.

235
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,322
This punk!

236
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
You should be focusing on your own work.

237
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,369
Dammit!

238
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,457
That little…

239
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,633
"This member advanced
from a private to a corporal

240
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,636
while waiting for Moonhole's next video."

241
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,222
No, you're overexaggerating.

242
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
-Blocked.
-Did she lose a lot of subscribers?

243
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,935
It's like looking at
last year's Bitcoin crash.

244
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,439
What's the point of editing her videos?

245
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,690
Hey, Cap.

246
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,776
The YouTuber herself went off the grid.

247
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,360
She's alive, right?

248
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,237
I think so.

249
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,406
Seeing that she's reading the group chat.

250
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,242
Not Moonhole, I mean Lovely Aunt.

251
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,665
You don't think she's dead, do you?

252
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,545
Oh fuck!

253
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,589
That prick is fucking strong.

254
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,803
Cap, can you make me
an iced caramel macchiato?

255
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,648
Where on earth have you been?

256
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,608
My ears! Fuck!

257
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,944
What? I told you I was going out.

258
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,654
You said you were going to buy cigarettes.

259
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,989
Was the convenience store in New Zealand?

260
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,449
What happened? Did you find her?

261
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
Find what?

262
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,204
Didn't you go around
looking for Lovely by yourself?

263
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,498
You went alone
to keep us away from danger.

264
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
Didn't you?

265
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,012
Why are you crying, idiot?

266
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,974
I was worried!

267
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,476
-You were worried?
-Gosh.

268
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,229
It's all right.

269
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,856
She's back now.

270
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
You poor bastard.

271
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,026
Breathe.

272
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,321
He just looks like a highway robber.

273
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,658
An alien chip?

274
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,868
In Troll's head?

275
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,496
An alien chip? What's that?

276
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,547
There are cases like this among people
who get kidnapped by UFOs.

277
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,967
Mysterious implants like electronic chips
are planted in their body.

278
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,178
No surgical marks, no pain.

279
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,679
They're completely clean.

280
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,556
It happened in Back Yoonsun's case too.

281
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,351
Then does Lovely Aunt have
the same thing in her head too?

282
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,686
She used to.

283
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,980
But those cultists took it out.

284
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
How did they take it out?

285
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,734
With a drill.

286
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,445
Ow! Gosh.

287
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,699
In my opinion, the important thing
is not how they took it, but why.

288
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,870
What is it about this chip
that they name her Messiah for it?

289
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,040
They said it's for salvation or whatever.

290
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,541
Huh?

291
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,335
The cult leader said so.

292
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,921
It has something to do
with salvation or whatever.

293
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,924
Well, anyway, isn't it over now?

294
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,468
You said Troll's boyfriend came back.

295
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,385
It's over?

296
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,098
Well, didn't all of this start
because she was trying to find that guy?

297
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,477
But now that she found him,
the cult, the alien chip, and all that,

298
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,062
it's all over.

299
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,820
Going to buy cigarettes again?

300
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,534
Why did you turn your fucking phone off?

301
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,454
Wait, are you the owner of this place?

302
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,581
If you're going somewhere,
you should tell me.

303
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,124
Is just sending a text enough?

304
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,376
Do you want to die?

305
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,711
Are there any rooms available?

306
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,547
What is it? A customer?

307
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,299
There are no customers at this café.

308
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,511
What is it? Tell me. Speak!
You're so frustrating.

309
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,595
Actually, I…

310
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,264
Huh? That's him.

311
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,057
Direct Kim.

312
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,184
-What?
-Direct Kim?

313
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,735
Hey, Younggi. Daddy's sorry.

314
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,070
I'm sorry!

315
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,656
Hey, what's going on?

316
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,533
-Please come grab her!
-Okay!

317
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:25,993
What is this?

318
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,494
Here!

319
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
Careful.

320
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:31,915
Younggi.

321
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,003
Don't hurt her!

322
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,045
The shotgun girl!

323
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,881
-What?
-The shotgun girl!

324
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,966
Let go of me!

325
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,634
Let me down!

326
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,428
What's going on?

327
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,762
What is this?

328
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,308
Dammit.

329
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,317
Did you get some sleep?

330
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,322
You should have breakfast.

331
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,283
This here is a McDonald's breakfast meal.

332
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,911
Gosh, you used to say
you want to eat this every day. I…

333
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,999
Are you happy you made fools
out of the church members?

334
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,918
Just how long have you been
a rat in our church?

335
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,803
That's not any way
to talk to your dad, is it?

336
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,015
What a nice father-daughter relationship
you two have, fuck.

337
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,685
Hey. Are you sure it's her?
The one who shot you?

338
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,105
I'm positive.
Defamation and abuse on top of that.

339
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,565
Direct Kim's daughter is a cultist?

340
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,067
What a sick-ass prank cam!

341
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,862
Wait. When were you going
to tell us about this?

342
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,907
The reason you wanted to get
into the NPC or whatever so much

343
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,367
was this all along?

344
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,077
That was the only option I had

345
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,080
if I wanted to at least see her face.

346
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,791
So you've been lying to us all this time.

347
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,334
You said your daughter was kidnapped.

348
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,294
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,631
I don't have time for this!

350
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,383
Where is Her Holiness?

351
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,467
Her Holiness?

352
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,636
Who? Are you talking about Jihyo?

353
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,555
She's only been cursing at me
and talking about "Her Holiness."

354
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,099
She wants to meet Jihyo.

355
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,141
Why?

356
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,522
Bora, come here.

357
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,898
-Why?
-Just a second.

358
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,609
What is it?

359
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,698
Anyway, let us stay here
for a little while.

360
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,699
What?

361
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:33,453
I don't have anywhere else to take her.
The church, they know where I live.

362
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,543
No. No way.

363
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,627
Mr. Direct Kim.

364
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,712
Give us a good reason
why we should do that.

365
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,880
There isn't one.

366
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,217
So many people almost got killed
by those crazy people.

367
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,301
I'll say.

368
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,886
You're partly responsible for that.

369
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,930
What?

370
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,934
These people were put in danger
because they listened to you.

371
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,648
Bora.

372
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,983
Please help me.

373
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,610
I helped you, right?

374
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,237
You and Jihyo.

375
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,074
Excuse me.

376
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,872
I'm the owner here.

377
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,998
Not her.

378
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,959
Well, I'm just saying.

379
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,669
How about 200,000 won per night?

380
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,756
Let me check the boiler room
on the second floor.

381
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,842
What? Why check the boiler?

382
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,094
They'll need to use hot water.

383
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,847
No, come on!

384
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,141
-Send them away!
-Cap, can I have 10,000 won?

385
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,486
No matter what the situation is,

386
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,904
food always comes first.

387
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,780
Especially for Koreans.

388
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,783
After you're done,
just leave the table out.

389
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,369
Thank you, Dad.

390
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,007
Siguk.

391
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,967
Are you hurt anywhere?

392
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,933
What in the world happened to you?

393
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,976
Do you know where Chao Phraya River is?

394
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,394
What?

395
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,147
They said I jumped from there,
from some bridge.

396
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,608
Jumped? What do you mean?

397
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,986
Apparently, I tried to kill myself.

398
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,488
What?

399
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,823
I opened my eyes, and I was in a hospital.

400
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,492
A Thai hospital.

401
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,702
I listened to what they said…

402
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,498
fell asleep, woke up,

403
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,834
fell asleep, woke up again,
and I was at Incheon Airport.

404
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,588
But why Thailand all of a sudden?

405
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,550
I really don't like food with cilantro.

406
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,842
Wait, so you…

407
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,720
Hold on, Siguk.

408
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,725
So you…

409
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,895
you don't remember
anything you went through?

410
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,231
What's the last thing you remember?

411
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,401
When you asked me to break up with you?

412
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:17,158
Before going to the bar,
I gave Jiyong some food and…

413
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,620
What happened to Jiyong?

414
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,872
I need to clean his litter box.

415
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,457
Gosh, he's a handful.

416
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,814
Tell Siguk to stay here for a while.

417
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,484
I can sleep in the living room.

418
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,819
Okay. Thank you.

419
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,074
We should at least do this for him.
What else could we do?

420
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,619
Because of my kid, he packed up everything

421
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,287
and tried to kill himself.

422
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,374
The average life expectancy
is about 60 to 70 years.

423
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,958
The aging process is very slow…

424
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,211
-Dad.
-What?

425
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,505
Do you remember that time

426
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,007
when I went missing in middle school?

427
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,886
Sturgeons, which take
a long time to reach adulthood…

428
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,264
You said that I kept saying
weird things at the hospital.

429
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,974
What did I say back then?

430
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,976
Why are you asking me that
all of a sudden?

431
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,353
It's just…

432
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,814
Do you remember anything?

433
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,065
I don't remember.

434
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,650
Nor do I want to.

435
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,738
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

436
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,949
Goodness.

437
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,617
Gosh.

438
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,913
There are people
who rescue sturgeon from danger

439
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,708
so that they can take time to fully grow.

440
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,585
Their name is "Save the Copra."

441
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,546
He can wear your dad's things for now.

442
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,631
Tell him to let us know
if he needs anything.

443
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,383
He'll have to buy everything anyway.

444
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,718
All right.

445
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,220
So,

446
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,889
what's going on?

447
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,519
Sorry? What do you mean?

448
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,771
You've been like that
since you were young.

449
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,608
If you have something on your mind,

450
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,112
you avoid eye contact and sneak around
as if you did something wrong.

451
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,656
So, what is it?

452
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,574
Oh…

453
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,368
It's because of Siguk.

454
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,788
You've been like that
since before he disappeared.

455
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,542
Is it uncomfortable to tell me?

456
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,005
Is it something
that you can solve on your own?

457
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,509
Well…

458
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,180
I…

459
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,186
I don't think Siguk tried to kill himself.

460
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,313
What do you mean?

461
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,233
No, it's nothing.

462
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,153
-Thank you.
-What is it?

463
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,905
It's nothing.

464
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,239
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,408
I'm the one who heard it.

466
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,410
Your ramblings back then.

467
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,457
What?

468
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,295
I was the first to arrive
at the hospital after getting the call.

469
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,797
When I got there,

470
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,049
you were asleep and mumbling something.

471
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,134
Like you were having a nightmare.

472
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,429
I just thought it was because of the glue.

473
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,808
Do you remember…

474
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,521
what I said back then?

475
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,147
I do.

476
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,652
You kept saying the same thing.

477
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,986
Back then,

478
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,739
what did I say?

479
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,746
"Come back."

480
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,122
What?

481
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,916
"Come back to me."

482
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,419
What are you saying?
You want me to go there now?

483
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,587
No, I mean,

484
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,757
that's what I kept repeating
at the hospital.

485
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,469
They'll come back to me…

486
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,470
Who comes back?

487
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,222
What do you mean, who? The aliens!

488
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,266
Why are they coming back?

489
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,811
I don't know,
but whatever they implanted in my head,

490
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,273
I think it has something to do with that.

491
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,526
Bora.

492
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,155
Do you think it's some sort of device
that calls the UFOs?

493
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,908
A transmitter?

494
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,785
Like a pager.

495
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,453
I'm not eating that!

496
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,371
Huh?

497
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,792
-What was that? What happened?
-I'm not going to eat it.

498
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,960
-No!
-Oh, nothing.

499
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,712
-Just eat this.
-Anyway, so what?

500
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,046
So what do you want to do?

501
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,047
Oh, well,

502
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,174
I'll go over there first.

503
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,092
I'll go and--

504
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,553
You don't need to come here
just because of that.

505
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,221
That's just your theory.

506
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,349
Don't you need to take care
of your boyfriend right now?

507
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,019
Just stay at home for a while.
Don't go out.

508
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:36,936
No…

509
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,272
No, Bora, we should talk first--

510
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,690
Now that you've found him,

511
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,109
keep an eye on him
so he doesn't run off again.

512
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,028
No, Bora, but this is still--

513
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,614
Sorry, but I have something to do.
I'm hanging up.

514
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,160
Bora!

515
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:58,917
Huh?

516
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,340
Siguk.

517
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:11,930
Where are you going?

518
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,307
Do you need something?

519
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,892
Want me to buy it?

520
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,937
I have to go somewhere.

521
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,896
Where?

522
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,192
Stay home for now.

523
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,736
Do you want to come with me?

524
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,829
Why do you keep asking for "Her Holiness"?

525
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,333
Can she summon a UFO or something?

526
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,794
What, is that it?

527
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,129
Where did you pick that shit up from?

528
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,840
The thing you guys took out
of Jihyo's head,

529
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,218
is that some kind of transmitter?

530
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,260
You call them.

531
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,762
The aliens come down.

532
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,472
What happens next?

533
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,936
What is this "Messiah"
supposed to be doing?

534
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,230
I looked this over,
and it's not in here either.

535
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,233
It only says,
"Messiah shows up to save mankind."

536
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,360
There's nothing after that.

537
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,488
So, what is it?

538
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,407
What does this "Messiah" do?

539
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,284
Bora, what are you doing?

540
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,745
Hold on. I'm talking to her right now.

541
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,331
Jeez, you should not talk
about the damned cult now.

542
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,958
She's already confused as is.

543
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,292
Shut up!

544
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,795
Do you even know anything
about our doctrines?

545
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,257
Are you really going to talk
to your dad like that?

546
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,301
What do you mean "Dad"?
What did you ever do for me?

547
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,886
What, punk? What did you say?

548
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,180
They're getting along
better than before, right?

549
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,098
Yep.

550
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,850
Do you know what I've done because of you?

551
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,435
I never asked you to do that!

552
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,520
Both of you shut up!

553
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,358
You.

554
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,777
If you don't start talking,
you're out of here.

555
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,531
And you'll never meet Your Holiness
or whatever again, so speak up.

556
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,034
Wanna get kicked out?

557
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,543
Okay, I got it.

558
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,837
Guys, call Cap.

559
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,380
Hey.

560
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,215
Bora, come on. Don't be like this.

561
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,425
I have to tell her.

562
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,554
I need to tell Her Holiness…

563
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,433
that she needs to run away right now.

564
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,312
What are you talking about?

565
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,231
The Corps is looking for her.

566
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,318
To kill her.

567
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,201
Who is it?

568
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,786
All the believers think

569
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,370
that Messiah

570
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,332
is already dead.

571
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,084
That she threw away her body

572
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,503
and was martyred.

573
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,010
This person here is the victim.

574
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,888
We're in a hurry to find out
where this person is.

575
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,891
It's not confirmed
whether he's alive or not.

576
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,270
Have you not been in touch
with Ms. Hong Jihyo?

577
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,440
No. We haven't.

578
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,112
Since she left home,
she hasn't answered our calls at all.

579
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,156
Messiah's funeral will be held soon.

580
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,493
So, they're trying to kill her?

581
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,329
Just to make their lie a reality?

582
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,705
The believers will want

583
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
to see her de--

584
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,877
Her holy body.

585
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,632
You can call my number directly.

586
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,883
Jeonwon Police Station?

587
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,426
You're not from Seoul?

588
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,720
It's a case that occurred
in our jurisdiction.

589
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,598
If the situation gets worse,
Seoul will get involved too.

590
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,350
And after the funeral,

591
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,353
Father will take Messiah's divine power

592
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,605
and use them in her stead.

593
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,486
Divine power? What power is that?

594
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,781
Ascension.

595
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,491
What?

596
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,577
The only one who can give

597
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,288
the gift of ascension
to the people of Earth…

598
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,085
is Messiah.

599
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,462
Not Father.

600
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,093
Soon,

601
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,097
Father Light will come down to Earth.

602
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,682
It's soon! Soon!

603
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,350
Okay, Sister Seo?

604
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,312
Aren't you embarrassed in front of them?

605
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,190
You're still so obsessed
with worldly desires.

606
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,317
What are you going to do? Huh?

607
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,651
Brother Oh.

608
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,279
-It's not that--
-Be quiet!

609
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,572
We didn't say you could speak!

610
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,365
For someone who is a deaconess,

611
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,701
how could you think so immaturely?

612
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,369
If you appease her like that,

613
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,581
did you think you'd get greater salvation?

614
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:52,168
It's a good thing
this happened after the surgery.

615
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,587
-It could have caused a bigger problem.
-Oh gosh.

616
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,173
She should be expelled
so she can't be saved.

617
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:01,135
Jeez, you guys are being too harsh

618
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,388
over a deaconess who caused some trouble.

619
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,813
Let's wrap this up.

620
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,567
Father will now make a decision.

621
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,328
Get up.

622
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,382
The sinner must await judgment.

623
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,942
If you die alone now,

624
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,236
you'll be so lonely.

625
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,822
You should go

626
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,324
when everyone else goes.

627
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,664
Everything now

628
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,375
is trivial anyway.

629
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,804
-You know what?
-Father!

630
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,265
I've been in a great mood these days.

631
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,977
-Dad!
-Everything in this world looks so small.

632
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,397
Before, I hated it so much,

633
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,901
the way people struggled to live.

634
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,905
-But nowadays, they look so adorable.
-Dad!

635
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,615
Sella.

636
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,783
I was wrong!

637
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,909
-Sella!
-Sella.

638
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,203
Father has forgiven you.

639
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,247
Thank you!

640
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,833
The trial is over.

641
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,383
Dad, I didn't do it on purpose!

642
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,561
I didn't know this would happen!

643
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,275
Let's go out. You can cry outside.

644
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,110
Dad!

645
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,531
I thought I was going to die!

646
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:32,078
Dad, the memorial invitation
is ready to be sent out.

647
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,205
Oh, thank you so much.

648
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,956
And, uh,

649
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,085
how's the tech team's preparation going?

650
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:44,465
Dad, they say they need more time.
What should we do?

651
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,136
And make our believers wait longer?

652
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,056
Tell them to make it on time.

653
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,100
Yes, understood.

654
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,267
Light be with you.

655
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,731
Don't worry.

656
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,483
Everything's going to be okay.

657
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,113
Jiyong!

658
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,325
Jiyong, I'm here. Jiyong, where are you?

659
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,412
Jiyong!

660
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,375
Jiyong, where are you? Jiyong.

661
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,459
Jiyong…

662
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,379
He's not here.

663
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,339
I tried to find him before.

664
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,258
I think someone took him.

665
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,010
Who would take that grubby kitty?

666
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,139
Jiyong.

667
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,557
Jiyong--

668
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,357
The kitty must be hungry.

669
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,036
Let's go home.

670
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,872
I don't have a home.

671
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,748
Don't be like that.

672
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,001
What about Jiyong?

673
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,919
I looked for him already.

674
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,005
What were you going to do
when you found him?

675
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,090
Take him and raise him?

676
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,092
I know your mom hates animals.

677
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,724
No, I just tried looking for him.

678
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,226
Did you just try looking for me too?

679
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,609
What were you going to do
when you found me?

680
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,777
Didn't we break up anyway?

681
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm sorry.

682
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,914
I knew everything.

683
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,585
I knew you felt pressured
when I talked about living together.

684
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,671
I noticed it from the signals
you gave me from the beginning.

685
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,841
I knew it, but I just kept pushing anyway.

686
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,971
If I hadn't brought it up that day,
you might not have broken up with me.

687
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:56,931
Shit!

688
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,766
Siguk.

689
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,143
But things didn't go as planned,

690
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:02,520
so I…

691
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,980
I tried to kill myself.

692
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,650
How can a person be so idiotic?

693
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,070
Why did I even work so hard all my life?

694
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,489
It's not your fault!

695
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,282
Hey, Siguk.

696
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,243
Think hard, okay?

697
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,453
Are you sure you did that? Huh?

698
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,289
I mean, did you really try to die?

699
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,417
Did you clear out your room,
put it up for rent,

700
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,295
and buy a plane ticket?
Did you really do all of that?

701
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,214
If not me, then who could have?

702
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,593
I mean, none of it adds up!

703
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,429
Huh? You think so too, don't you?

704
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,348
I don't know. I just don't remember!

705
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,943
LOVELY AUNT, ARE YOU WATCHING?
DO YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS? LOL

706
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,820
UFO FORUM MODS

707
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,412
Yes, ma'am.

708
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,831
I'm checking where she has been.

709
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,624
We should be able to find her today.

710
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,502
-Don't worry too much--
-You don't get it.

711
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,671
We must find her whereabouts today.

712
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,840
You know we don't have time.

713
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,927
Her location just came up.
I'll send it to you right away.

714
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,346
You can take care of the rest.

715
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,764
I'll withdraw for now.

716
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,516
Okay.

717
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,352
Ascension…

718
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,397
Do you get another arm or something?

719
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,692
The ability to fly would be cool too.
Like growing wings.

720
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,736
I want teleportation, for sure.

721
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,655
It's not that great.

722
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,407
The ascension they're talking about.

723
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,825
What?

724
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,661
What those cultists call ascension,

725
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,955
it's different from what you're thinking.

726
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,542
It means they just get together
and commit pointless crimes, okay?

727
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:49,918
Forget it.

728
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,255
Those punks will try to do something
at Jihyo's funeral--

729
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,715
"Jihyo's funeral"?

730
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,471
My funeral?

731
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,641
What are you talking about?

732
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,267
Your Holiness!

733
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,106
-Dammit, Jihyo!
-Jihyo!

734
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,524
-Jihyo!
-Hey!

735
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,984
What the hell! It was you, right?

736
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,736
You're the ones who kidnapped Siguk!

737
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,695
Let her go!

738
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,448
Do you know
how broken Siguk is because of you?

739
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,491
Gosh. Jihyo, don't!

740
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,661
Did you throw him out like trash
and call it a day after using him?

741
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,329
Hey, what is this?

742
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,081
What did you take out of my head?

743
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,499
Calm down, please!

744
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,001
Hey! Try to calm down!

745
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,927
She's Direct Kim's daughter?

746
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,261
Huh?

747
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,266
He lied to us this whole time?

748
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,188
She's more useful than you think.

749
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:55,067
She's giving up information.
Why are you charging at her like that?

750
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,279
Bora, why don't we have any evidence yet?

751
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,365
-What?
-About what we've done.

752
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,035
Aliens and cults and things like that.

753
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,122
At the end of the day,
people will think we're crazy.

754
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,041
Even if we work so hard!

755
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,292
If there's no evidence,

756
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,295
if there's no proof,
nobody will believe us, okay?

757
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,923
What's the point if nobody believes us?

758
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,551
Then isn't this all just a big nothing?

759
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,052
Hey.

760
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,638
Do you know what state
Siguk is in right now?

761
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,724
He doesn't even know what happened to him.

762
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,101
You don't know how it feels, do you?

763
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,269
Huh?

764
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,062
What I'm saying is…

765
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,192
you don't understand
just how crazy that makes you.

766
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,569
DIVINE LIGHT CHURCH

767
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,911
BE BORN AGAIN THROUGH THE LIGHT

768
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,759
"Memorial"?

769
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,306
FASTING THE DAY
BEFORE THE MEMORIAL SERVICE!

770
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,850
"Ascension is the life and salvation.

771
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,268
We must abandon our carbon bodies

772
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:56,063
and put on the body of Light
that is the same as Father's form."

773
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,899
These people think

774
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,404
that this body is the root of all evil.

775
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,573
So they need to abandon it.

776
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,658
Wait.

777
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,245
Abandoning your body?

778
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,706
So, doesn't that mean death?

779
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,251
Then why did they take out the alien chip?

780
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,922
I'm guessing the chips are
some kind of beacon or signal fire.

781
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,966
It becomes the target spot.

782
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,969
Then a fleet of UFOs appear there,
and bang, it's over.

783
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,512
But then everyone dies.

784
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,514
Isn't that just destruction of humanity?

785
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,851
Fuck. Why is this thing
suddenly turning into something big?

786
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,310
We're supposed to believe this?

787
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,316
Hey, stay still.
Why are you shaking your legs?

788
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,442
I'm not shaking them.

789
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,530
It's mass suicide.

790
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,577
"Ascension" is mass suicide,
not the destruction of humanity.

791
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,620
What do you mean?

792
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,374
It's not the first time they've done that.

793
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,878
In the past, they went on
about ascension and whatnot

794
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,130
and hanged themselves together.

795
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,884
They tricked people into believing
that abandoning your body is ascension.

796
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,053
One of the people
who hanged themselves at the time

797
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,889
was her grandmother.

798
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,099
And she happened to be there at the time.

799
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:15,851
Anyway,

800
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,396
those trash people are
getting together to kill themselves,

801
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,314
so just let them.

802
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,318
It's not the Messiah's funeral.
It's theirs.

803
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,742
Ms. Hong.

804
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,994
Whatever's in your memory,

805
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,832
that

806
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,085
will bring salvation to us all.

807
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,795
It's there.

808
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,007
What?

809
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,677
The chip is going to be there.

810
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,555
At my funeral.

811
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,515
With the cult leader.

812
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,018
And?

813
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,938
I have to find it.

814
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:02,940
What?

815
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,566
How?

816
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,777
Wait a second.
Do you seriously believe that?

817
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,903
The aliens or whatever?

818
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,032
Yes. I believe it.

819
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,242
I do believe.

820
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,827
The aliens or whatever.

821
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,913
There was a chip in my head,

822
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,082
and I lost it to them without knowing.

823
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,875
I need to find that chip first.

824
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,211
I'll find it and get rid of it.

825
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,713
-Don't be ridiculous. Shut up.
-No, Bora, this is--

826
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,465
Hey, shut up for a second.

827
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,549
No, Bora!

828
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,719
This is all because of me, okay?

829
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,721
This happened because I lost the chip.

830
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,515
Yes, I…

831
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:39,267
I have to go! You don't have to go.

832
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,061
You all don't have to go. Really.

833
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,771
I'll do something about it--

834
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,231
I told you to shut up!

835
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,862
Don't go and do something
that might get you killed

836
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,572
unless you want to die by my hands.

837
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,659
Where are you going?

838
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,369
To buy cigarettes.

839
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,871
A memorial service?

840
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,833
-Did someone die?
-I don't know.

841
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,419
But as of today, the worship service
and everything was canceled.

842
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,505
What kind of event would
make them close the church doors?

843
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,091
Isn't it like a break or something?

844
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,510
No. There was nothing in the church.

845
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,929
They got rid of the furniture
and everything.

846
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,933
Why is everything they do so creepy?

847
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,561
Anything else? Did you find anything?

848
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:26,773
Hello?

849
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,651
I need to help someone
with a civil complaint.

850
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,278
I'll call you back. Okay.

851
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,237
Okay.

852
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,539
You were here when Ms. Hong
caused a scene at the church, right?

853
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,458
You're Ms. Hong's friend.

854
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,591
Open it.

855
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,092
There's a computer here.

856
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,070
Why is it so quiet here? Huh?

857
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,488
Where did everyone go?

858
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,783
Well, Bora's not back yet.

859
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,701
Phillip and Donghyuk went home.

860
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,954
And what about the owner?

861
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,122
The gym.

862
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,874
-At a time like this?
-Yes.

863
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,087
He's more afraid of muscle loss
than the destruction of mankind.

864
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,101
Hey, Jihyo.

865
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,520
Yes?

866
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,146
What are you doing here?

867
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,192
I'm smoking.

868
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,694
That's not what I meant.
You said your boyfriend came back.

869
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,115
He did.

870
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,451
But what are you still doing here?

871
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,412
Wasn't your goal
to find him in the first place?

872
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,171
Give me a cigarette too.

873
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:17,968
Here.

874
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,139
I don't know how long it's been
since I last smoked.

875
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,482
-Come in after you're done.
-Okay.

876
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,668
Hey,

877
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:57,048
about my funeral,
do you know when it's happening?

878
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,218
I don't.

879
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,557
What about the location?
Don't you know where it is?

880
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,642
Why do you ask?

881
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:10,979
Speak.

882
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:11,897
The

883
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,566
Messiah is asking you.

884
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,361
Your Holiness.

885
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,989
Are you going to retrieve it?

886
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:22,407
Am I right?

887
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,285
You're trying to regain your divine power?

888
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,247
That's right.

889
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,208
Well…

890
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,378
I don't know the location.

891
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,966
But in the security team's
group chat room,

892
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,676
there should be an announcement.

893
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,053
Where's your phone?

894
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,473
He took it from me earlier.

895
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,308
It's in the car.

896
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,770
The car keys.

897
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,146
Where are the keys?

898
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,975
Where the heck are they?

899
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,686
Where are they?

900
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,397
Where can they be? Oh?

901
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,564
Hold on.

902
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,695
I found them.

903
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,957
Stay still!

904
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,463
Don't move!

905
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,635
Stop! Stop it!

906
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,435
Don't!

907
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,861
We've secured the Messiah's body.

908
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,196
We have also secured Sister Abigail. Over.

909
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,329
Your Holiness!

910
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,668
Quickly. We have to go.

911
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,637
Younggi!

912
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,972
Younggi, don't go!

913
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,810
-Huh?
-Younggi!

914
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,520
Don't! Don't go!

915
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,021
Mr. Kim.

916
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,023
Younggi, you can't leave!

917
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,192
You can't go!

918
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,443
We have to hurry.

919
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,780
Younggi, don't leave. Younggi!

920
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,031
Younggi, don't leave.

921
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,199
Younggi, don't…

922
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,201
Don't go.

923
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,369
Move!

924
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,666
Younggi!

925
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,794
What should we do?

926
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,133
Watch out!

927
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,851
You little shit.

928
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,195
-Let's go.
-Your Holiness, hold on tight.

929
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:19,829
What's going on?

930
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,915
What's all this about?

931
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:24,584
Captain Price.

932
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,756
Get out of here. More people are coming.

933
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,924
What?

934
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,140
Younggi…

935
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:47,899
Huh? Wait.

936
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,150
Don't go.

937
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,861
Please take care of Mr. Kim.

938
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,155
Captain Price.

939
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,368
I'm so sorry.

940
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,285
What?

941
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,122
No. Wait.

942
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,254
Captain Price.

943
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,924
Thank you for everything.

944
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,133
What?

945
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,887
Please tell everyone I said that too.

946
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,930
Wait…

947
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,567
Your Holiness! Quickly!

948
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,738
Wait.

949
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,490
Lovely.

950
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,826
Lovely, where are you going?

951
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,327
Where are you going?

952
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:14,128
