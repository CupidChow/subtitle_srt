1
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,019
I've been poisoned.

2
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,500
The Fu family's deadly poison.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,960
Fu Cangtian.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,179
You've become a lackey of the Demonic Cult.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,739
You're making baseless accusations.

6
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,759
The Fu family never used poison.

7
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:35,320
What is really going on?

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,200
Everything is under my control.

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,560
Chen Yuanqi, you do have some skill.

10
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,679
But you're just a pawn on my chessboard.

11
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,740
My cultivation has been restored.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Tell me, who truly rules this world?

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,200
Chen Yuanqi.

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,479
I told you I'd make you regret it.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,240
Dreaming of defying fate? Impossible.

16
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:02,039
I gave you a chance.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,040
All I ever wanted was to climb up the social ladder.

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,319
But the Fu family cast me aside like trash.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,299
Only the cult leader saw my worth.

20
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,099
He'll make me the Demon Queen once it's done.

21
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,879
That's the status I deserve.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,959
You're all surrounded by me alone.

23
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,260
Surrender and you'll be spared.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,719
Otherwise, today is your day to die.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,900
Qingyun, Qingyun!

26
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,760
Don't become a lackey of Dugu Zhantian.

27
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,640
Sinners against the Righteous Path.

28
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,120
Enemies of the Righteous Path.

29
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,359
If the Righteous Path abandons me, I'd rather become a demon.

30
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:52,459
Stop!

31
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,260
Son, run!

32
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,959
Yuanqi! Mother!

33
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:01,560
Mother!

34
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,140
Mother!

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,159
This is my gift for your alliance leader ceremony. Do you like it?

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,159
Brother Yuanqi, are you alright?

37
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,139
Brother Yuanqi! Yuanqi!

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,419
Chen Yuanqi, the power in your body is now mine.

39
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,060
Dugu Zhantian, don't be arrogant!

40
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,639
Divine Maiden Tongtian.

41
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,280
You forcibly summoned your imprisoned body here.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,199
Your cultivation is less than ten percent.

43
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,300
You're no match for me.

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,039
You can't fool me.

45
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,280
So what if I did?

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,340
I admire you.

47
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,219
I'll give you a chance to submit to me.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,819
Otherwise, you'll die today.

49
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,759
Even Heaven's suppression couldn't make me bow.

50
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,360
Who do you think you are?

51
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm here for one thing today.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
You bullied my disciple.

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,979
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,639
Are you arrogant or just seeking death?

55
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,639
Divine Maiden, that's Dugu Zhantian.

56
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,539
His cultivation is nearly unmatched.

57
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,639
No!

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,879
Who says ten percent power can't kill?

59
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm here to defeat the strongest.

60
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,759
A mere demon dares touch my disciple?

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,159
Yuanqi.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,759
Remember.

63
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,099
Those who practice my Reverse Immortal Ascension Art

64
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,960
don't know the meaning of fear.

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,419
Watch this move closely.

66
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,340
Because it's truly impressive.

67
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,780
Boshun Demon Art.

68
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,759
Star-Devouring Divine Palm.

69
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,719
Primordial Chaos Unleashed.

70
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,139
Sword Lifts the Heavens.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,819
Immortal-Slaying Sword Strike.

72
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,439
Heaven-Splitting Earth-Cleaving.

73
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,519
Slash!

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
Can you escape?

75
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,379
This place is relatively safe. Stay here.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Divine Maiden.

77
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:42,980
Divine Maiden! Sister Divine Maiden!

78
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,019
Divine Maiden! Divine Maiden!

79
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:46,759
Divine Maiden.

80
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,279
Sister Divine Maiden, kid.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
I've disappointed you this time.

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
This time, sister...

83
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,060
I probably can't make it.

84
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,759
What?

85
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,379
Don't scare me.

86
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,459
What's wrong?

87
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,740
It's all my fault.

88
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,540
I caused this to happen to you.

89
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,860
You've already come far enough.

90
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm actually glad I met you.

91
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,540
It was you who made me realize

92
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,600
If possible,

93
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,540
I really want to prove it to that old Heaven's Will.

94
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,519
Fate—

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
it truly can be changed.

96
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,279
No.

97
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,600
No, I don't want that.

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Don't.

99
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,480
Sister.

100
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,759
Didn't you promise to train with me?

101
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,259
You can't break your word.

102
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,600
I won't make you angry anymore.

103
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,360
I'll listen to you about everything, okay?

104
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,920
Don't leave me.

105
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,139
Let us in.

106
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:08,560
Let us in.

107
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Brother Yuanqi.

108
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:11,500
Sister.

109
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,240
Kid.

110
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,319
You've already done enough.

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,899
If anyone can truly defy fate,

112
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,560
Sister believes

113
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,379
that person

114
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,519
will definitely be you.

115
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:19,980
Divine Maiden

116
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,920
Sister

117
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,819
Sister

118
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,160
Sister

119
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,860
Sister

120
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,579
Sister

121
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,959
Will drinking like this bring Sister Divine Maiden back?

122
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,660
Give it to me.

123
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,740
Chen Yuanqi, pull yourself together.

124
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,839
Get a grip.

125
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,159
I'm nothing but a cripple with my meridians severed.

126
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,799
What's the point of pulling myself together?

127
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:06,740
I've studied many ancient texts.

128
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,580
You could try refining the Hetu Heavenly Tome into your artifact.

129
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,759
Maybe your cultivation can be restored.

130
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:13,879
Hetu Heavenly Tome

131
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,419
Cultivation restored

132
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,779
What's the point of restoring my cultivation?

133
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,720
If we keep fighting,

134
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,299
who else will die?

135
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,120
Will it be you or Xiao Qiu?

136
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,860
I don't want to lose anyone else.

137
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,440
Maybe it's better to just keep hiding.

138
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,179
Hiding is enough.

139
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,039
Are you going to hide forever?

140
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,679
Once I absorb the power of the Divine Maiden's sword,

141
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,320
my wounds will heal.

142
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,179
I will be the strongest in this world.

143
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,379
Deliver my command.

144
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:22,100
I will seclude myself for one month.

145
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,440
After I emerge,

146
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,899
I will wipe out the Righteous Path, leaving no survivors.

147
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,419
Those who submit shall prosper, those who resist shall perish.
