1
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,599
Third Sword of Evil-Slaying

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,559
With this sword I cleave heaven and earth

3
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,960
When the mortal journey ends, destiny is changed

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,939
All karmic laws will be renewed

5
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,100
Who are you?

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,240
I am the Heavenly Dao

7
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,500
I made a wager with Tongtian

8
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,540
To see if anyone can stay true and defy fate to alter destiny

9
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,260
Chen Yuanqi, congratulations

10
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,340
You have won

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,859
From now on, you are the master of this world

12
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,379
Master of the world

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,540
Yes, from now on in this world

14
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,739
You may set the rules as you wish

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,840
No more will the good be oppressed

16
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,859
All will be equal

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,680
Thank the heavens

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,239
Then my mother and Xiao Qiu

19
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
And the goddess

20
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,879
And all the innocent who died

21
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,379
Can they all be brought back to life?

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,939
That cannot be done

23
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,739
All things follow karma

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,560
What has happened cannot be changed

25
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,019
Unless

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,840
Unless what?

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,359
Unless you exchange something of equal weight

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,120
For example, someone who saves the world and possesses great merit

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,000
Does that mean

30
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,780
I can offer myself in exchange?

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,740
I am willing

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
It is more than that

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,800
Not just death

34
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,280
But the disappearance of your soul

35
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,259
Chen Yuanqi

36
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:28,219
In the new world, they will forget you

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,259
Forget me?

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,599
Yes

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,139
No one will remember you

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,500
Not even your mother or your beloved

41
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,000
Can you accept this price?

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,639
Why go so far?

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,860
Then

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,580
Will they

45
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,139
be well?

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,620
They will

47
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,800
Because they won't even know

48
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
that there was someone who loved them

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,159
and sacrificed for them

50
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:12,919
Alright

51
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,520
You

52
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,639
Must keep your word

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,199
Those who establish lives for the people

54
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,240
Though dead, they live on

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,479
Chen Yuanqi

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,939
Farewell forever

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,259
No

58
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,599
No, don't

59
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,280
Yuanqi

60
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,139
Don't

61
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,580
No

62
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,599
Don't die

63
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,800
If you leave

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,979
I'll hate you for eternity

65
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,879
To have known and met you in this life

66
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,979
I have no regrets

67
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:23,759
Farewell forever

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,600
Yuanqi, don't

69
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,040
Come back

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,860
Come back

71
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,540
Come back

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,839
Yuanqi, don't leave me. Yuanqi

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,079
Yuanqi

74
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,420
Come back

75
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:51,860
How did I...

76
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,740
How am I still alive?

77
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,040
This is my home.

78
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:11,500
This is my home.

79
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,120
Young man, you're awake.

80
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
I saw you faint at the village entrance yesterday.

81
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,939
So I brought you back.

82
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,240
Mother.

83
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:29,980
Mother.

84
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,579
It's really you.

85
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,699
Mother.

86
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,779
I'm not your mother.

87
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,339
Maybe you're still confused from sleep.

88
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:39,879
You must be hungry.

89
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,579
Here, have something to eat.

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,519
Take it.

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,540
Could it be that no one really remembers me?

92
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,560
Mother.

93
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,300
Madam.

94
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,019
Is everything well at home?

95
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,459
Do you have enough to eat?

96
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,259
Are you warm enough?

97
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,139
Has anyone bullied you?

98
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,019
Everything is fine.

99
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,579
Everyone is prosperous, every family is happy.

100
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,339
By the way, young man,

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,339
where are you from?

102
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,519
Where are you headed?

103
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,040
That's right.

104
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
Where should I go?

105
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,279
Are you here looking for family?

106
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,040
What's your name?

107
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,379
Oh, right.

108
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,819
I saw you have a Tianyuan Academy token.

109
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,399
Are you a student there?

110
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:47,920
Tianyuan Academy...

111
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,819
It still exists?

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,519
Yes, it does.

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,100
Tianyuan Academy teaches children for free.

114
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,180
It's wonderful.

115
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,480
Really?

116
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,339
That's great.

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,680
Young man,

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,519
you should hurry back to the Academy.

119
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,699
Your family will worry if they can't find you.

120
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,879
Madam,

121
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,680
are you the only one at home?

122
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,040
Does anyone take care of you?

123
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,279
Mother, I'm back!

124
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,639
Big brother, you're awake!

125
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,259
I was the one who found you.

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,060
Yuanling, don't be naughty.

127
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,639
But I really did see big brother faint at the village entrance.

128
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,080
Madam,

129
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
This is...

130
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,539
This is my daughter, Yuanling.

131
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,059
She's eighteen this year.

132
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,720
Nineteen.

133
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,799
Mother, you got my age wrong again.

134
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,580
Yes, yes, nineteen.

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,120
Our Yuanling is already a grown woman.

136
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,980
Yuanling.

137
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,940
Big brother is going back to the Academy.

138
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
Show him the way.

139
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,820
Come back early for dinner.

140
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,139
Okay.

141
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,980
Big brother, let's go.

142
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,600
Big brother.

143
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,519
Follow this road to the end,

144
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,700
and you'll reach Tianyuan Academy.

145
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,139
I have to go home now.

146
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,639
Hurry back.

147
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,980
Remember to listen to your mother.

148
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,200
Got it.

149
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,279
In this vast world,

150
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,860
there are no old friends left for me.

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
Chen Yuanqi.

152
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,039
Where are you going?

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,899
Aren't you taking us with you?

154
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,480
You all...

155
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,100
You all...

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,559
After you left,

157
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,340
we helped save the world,

158
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,659
and accumulated merit.

159
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,659
We made another wish to the Heavenly Dao.

160
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,440
The first was to bring you back.

161
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:13,200
The second,

162
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,399
is that we will never forget you.

163
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:33,419
My name is Chen Yuanqi.

164
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
This is a story about destiny.

165
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,519
I believe

166
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,879
that everyone who has suffered oppression

167
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,620
will eventually overcome the hardships of fate

168
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,500
and find their own happiness.

169
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,340
No matter how hard this road may be,

170
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,120
please believe

171
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,659
that light

172
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,740
will be waiting for you in the future.
