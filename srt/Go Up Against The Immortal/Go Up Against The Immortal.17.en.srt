1
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,079
More of a hindrance than a help.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,160
Master.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,980
Master.

4
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,879
Please forgive me this time.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,160
For the sake of

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,019
Yanzhi serving you for so long.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,940
Get out.

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,300
You're useless now.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,539
Master.

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,020
I beg you, Master.

11
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,119
Master.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,820
Leave.

13
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,140
Since you're here,

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,219
why are you hiding?

15
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,299
Who are you?

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,620
What are you here for?

17
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,640
Master Fu, your cultivation is impressive.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,900
I am a Spiritual Cultivator.

19
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,719
I'm here to sell spiritual power-enhancing medicines.

20
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,760
Such medicines always have side effects.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,980
Do you think

22
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm a fool?

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,459
With the current situation,

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,060
the three great families plus Chen Yuanqi

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,780
are not easy to deal with.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,640
Why not take a look at my goods first?

27
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,120
Every deal comes with a price.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,859
But I don't believe

29
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,980
you won't be tempted.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,860
Here it comes!

31
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:18,539
The last dish.

32
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,719
Brother Yuanqi, you're amazing!

33
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,219
These are my specialty dishes.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,500
Can I sneak a bite?

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,719
I've been holding back for so long.

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,680
How does it taste?

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,860
It smells so good!

38
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,340
Brother Yuanqi, you're the best!

39
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:34,680
You're back!

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,919
I've been waiting for you.

41
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,099
Come on, sit down quickly!

42
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,479
I've waited so long, sit down!

43
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,080
Congratulations, little champion!

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,039
Try my cooking.

45
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,919
To celebrate my success in the medical exam.

46
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,139
Brother Yuanqi.

47
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,780
I believe you can do it.

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,560
You'll win the next championship too.

49
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,719
Alright, wait for my victory.

50
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,520
I'll ask the righteous to help find your other clansmen.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Brother Yuanqi.

52
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,939
You're so good to me.

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,219
Sister Lie.

54
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,680
When Brother Yuanqi becomes the Righteous Alliance Leader,

55
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,259
what do you want?

56
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,939
I don't have time to daydream with you two.

57
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,719
Don't disturb my meal.

58
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,039
All you care about is eating!

59
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,979
Brother Yuanqi's cooking is delicious, right?

60
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,080
I wish we could always be like this.

61
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,139
And with Sister Yumeng too.

62
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,919
I hope we can always be together.

63
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,800
Eat and play together till old age.

64
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,259
Sure!

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,580
When that time comes,

66
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,060
I'll cook for you every day.

67
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,439
Is it really that blissful?

68
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,800
Here, try this one too.

69
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,740
Thank you, Brother Yuanqi.

70
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,139
Here, you try it too.

71
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,419
It's so tasty!

72
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,879
Today's dishes are much better than before.

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Everything tastes great.

74
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,319
You should eat more too.

75
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:48,599
Eat more!

76
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,120
Training is tough.

77
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
Lie Shumei.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,100
Kneel and receive orders.

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,600
I didn't expect you to be the Holy Envoy of the Cult Leader.

80
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,160
Please give your orders, Holy Envoy.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,220
I want you to atone for your mistakes.

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,279
Use this packet of Gu Powder

83
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,339
on Chen Yuanqi.

84
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,279
He will become my complete puppet.

85
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,939
Forgive me, Holy Envoy.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,259
I'm now Chen Yuanqi's Sword Spirit.

87
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't harm my host.

88
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,399
This method

89
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,000
can free you from the Sword Spirit's restraints.

90
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,500
But Chen Yuanqi has divine protection.

91
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:04,899
He's immune to all poisons.

92
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,379
I'm afraid I...

93
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,060
No matter.

94
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,639
This is a Gu insect, not poison.

95
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,759
It can make Chen Yuanqi lose all his power at a critical moment.

96
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,519
Lie Shumei.

97
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,220
Have you forgotten the price of defying the Cult Leader?

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,420
I...

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,120
I have no choice.

101
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,319
Why?

102
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,319
Why is this happening?

103
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
I tried so hard.

104
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,079
I just wanted to rise from obscurity to prominence.

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,399
What did I do wrong?

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,500
Fu Cangtian.

107
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,740
I've served you so many times.

108
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,800
And yet you just cast me out like this.

109
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,800
What did I do to deserve this?

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,040
It's not your fault.

111
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:08,939
Who?

112
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,060
Someone who can give you everything.

113
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,480
The Seven Meridians Championship, the martial arts competition begins.

114
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,959
I don't know where Sister Lie went.

115
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,019
I'm really worried about her.

116
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,480
Isn't she your Sword Spirit?

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,699
How could she leave the Chiyou Sword?

118
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,259
I don't know either.

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,740
Will she come back?

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,100
If she truly insists on leaving,

121
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,800
I can't force her to stay.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,240
First round of the competition.

123
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,339
Ye Xuan from Divine Sword Manor.

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,220
Versus Chen Yuanqi from the humble clan.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,579
Brother Yuanqi, what's wrong?

126
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:06,500
It's nothing.

127
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,019
Go, Brother Yuanqi!

128
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,199
I believe in you.

129
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,000
Ye Xuan, head of the Ye family at Divine Sword Manor.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Ye Xuan, master of Innate Sword Qi.

131
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:20,800
Oh no.

132
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,019
How did Brother Yuanqi end up facing him?

133
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,699
Why are you boosting his morale and doubting yourself?

134
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,579
Brother Yuanqi can't possibly lose!

135
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:31,600
My Sword Qi...

136
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,899
Lethal in ten paces.

137
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,419
I'll strike three times.

138
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,679
If you survive,

139
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,220
I'll spare your life.

140
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,480
Do noble families always boast so much?

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,700
First strike—Sword Qi spans ninety thousand miles!

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,379
No, why is my Phoenix Flame Eternal sealed?
