1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,460
Yumeng

2
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,500
Yumeng

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,620
Yuanqi

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,519
I'm here.

5
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,320
Yumeng, why did you come here?

6
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,019
Yuanqi

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,980
Seven Meridians Competition

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,500
You must return safely.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,899
Promise me, okay?

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,640
You don't need to worry about me.

11
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,960
I'll be fine.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,600
How could I not worry about you?

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,679
Father wants me to become the Jiang family's heir.

14
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,340
He wants me to enter the secret realm trial.

15
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,280
It's really just to stop me from going with you.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,859
Whenever I think about it,

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,740
my heart is filled with

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,659
all

19
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,859
All what?

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,859
It's all worry for you, silly.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,140
The Seven Meridians Competition isn't an ordinary contest.

22
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,079
Win, and you'll be the leader of the righteous path.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,620
Power struggles have always been the cruelest.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,719
I didn't expect Father to use this to trouble you.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,200
Yumeng, it's fine.

26
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:25,700
For you,

27
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,560
I have to accept it.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,120
Yumeng, you...

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,400
With my Ice Body, I took

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,579
the Jiang clan's rare medicine,

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,920
Hundred-Year Ice Crystal Essence.

32
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,280
I condensed it into true energy and passed it to you.

33
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,400
I hope

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,020
it can accompany you through the competition in my place.

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,319
Yumeng

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,699
This quiet place is perfect for cultivation.

37
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,280
I won't disturb you.

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,539
I'll leave now.

39
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:37,759
Yumeng

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,780
Thank you.

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,199
I will win.

42
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,419
I believe in you.

43
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,199
I'm leaving.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,979
Seven Meridians Competition

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,819
officially begins.

46
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,479
Plagues run rampant in the world.

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,360
Cultivators must produce many pills each year to save people.

48
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,099
The first trial of the Seven Meridians Competition

49
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,199
is the medical trial: refining herbs.

50
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,659
Eight fellow cultivators,

51
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,919
in front of each of you

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,500
is a hundred-herb altar

53
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:46,800
and a Five Elements Furnace.

54
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,199
Place Yuanling Grass into the furnace.

55
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,500
Channel spiritual energy to form the pills.

56
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,419
Whoever refines the most and best pills

57
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,900
the top four may enter the next martial trial.

58
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,219
How miserable.

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
So overconfident.

60
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,379
Looks like they can't withstand the poison.

61
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,620
The Yuanling Grass in these altars

62
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,319
is Duanhun Grass.

63
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,439
That's right.

64
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,339
The deadliest herb makes the best medicine.

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,860
Medicine slaves only dare to dig it up with the soil.

66
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,019
They don't dare touch it at all.

67
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,600
I don't get these clueless commoner disciples.

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,699
Why are they even competing?

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,420
Right? Exactly.

70
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,360
It's ridiculous.

71
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,620
This tiny flame can't refine pills at all.

72
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,199
Unless the cultivator has multiple elemental techniques,

73
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,040
how can they refine pills with such a small flame?

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm poisoned.

75
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:00,860
After all my effort,

76
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,720
decades of hard cultivation,

77
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,319
leaving my hometown,

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,199
I finally climbed the 108-step heavenly ladder.

79
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,319
I'm about to achieve success and fame.

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,180
But now I'll die of poison here.

81
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,920
The elders in my hometown are still waiting for me.

82
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,699
I... I've let you all down.

83
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:20,100
I've let you down.

84
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:20,959
I'll save you.

85
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,740
These commoner disciples

86
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,459
I don't know what they do all day.

87
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,959
Still dreaming of a leap to success?

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,279
Thank you, benefactor.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
Why did you save me?

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,420
No need for that.

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,100
We are both commoner disciples.

92
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,920
These noble disciples

93
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,779
all see us as mere servants.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,160
We should look out for each other.

95
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,279
Don't die here.

96
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,339
Your people are still waiting for you to return home.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Alright.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Will Yuanqi be in danger?

99
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm really worried about him.

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,740
What if something happens to him?

101
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,379
He'll be fine.

102
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,860
Another commoner disciple has started refining medicine.

103
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,699
I bet he'll fail soon.

104
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,740
This must be his first time seeing Duanchang Grass.

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,319
Our clan leader has succeeded.

106
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,120
Good, good, good.

107
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,180
Our clan leader refined one too.

108
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,639
This kid is interesting.

109
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,600
But he's still far behind.

110
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,160
He actually has three elemental attributes.

111
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,540
Is this the legendary Sanhua Juding?

112
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:04,600
That's impossible.

113
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,360
Even noble clans rarely see this.

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,860
A one-in-ten-thousand talent.

115
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,220
He must have used some evil trick in this competition.

116
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,759
This can't be real.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,519
A lowly commoner produced someone like this?

118
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,879
Chen Yuanqi is remarkable.

119
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,920
I didn't expect this.

120
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,000
You've got some skills.

121
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,939
I've got plenty more.

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,420
Then be my son.

123
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,980
Are you out of your mind,

124
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,699
or did I hear you wrong?

125
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:37,899
My mind is perfectly fine.

126
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,040
And you heard me right.

127
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:40,680
I admire you.

128
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,660
Too bad I don't have a daughter.

129
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,899
Otherwise, I'd marry her to you.

130
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
I won't betray my family.

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:49,980
You—

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,740
I'll ask you one last time.

133
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,000
Will you join the Fu family?

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,160
I'll tell you one last time.

135
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,199
Keep dreaming.

136
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,139
Fine.

137
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,259
Boy,

138
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,920
you will die today.

139
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,120
After I win,

140
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,980
I'll make life even harder for all commoner disciples.

141
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,800
They'll never rise up.

142
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,199
So no one like you ever appears again.

143
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,759
A divine pill refined with five elemental skills—

144
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,679
Is this the legendary Wuqi Chaoyuan?

145
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,559
Chen Yuanqi is in danger.

146
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,399
Fu Cangtian will kill him after the battle.

147
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,259
Sister Lie, what is Wuqi Chaoyuan?

148
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,960
Wuqi Chaoyuan is a one-in-ten-thousand cultivation talent.

149
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,519
It allows you to train five different skills at once.

150
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,620
Cultivation speed is several times faster than normal.

151
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,980
Then Yuanqi—

152
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,240
This Chen Yuanqi kid—

153
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,639
How can he compete with our clan leader?

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,320
Exactly.

155
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,740
What gives him the right?

156
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,980
He's definitely not as good as our clan leader.

157
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,919
Are we commoner disciples

158
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,539
never going to have a chance to rise?

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,100
Yuanqi, don't push yourself or you'll die.
