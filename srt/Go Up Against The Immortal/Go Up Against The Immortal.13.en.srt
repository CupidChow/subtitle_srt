1
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:15,240
Courting death.

2
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,600
Chen Yuanqi.

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,979
Why are you doing this?

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,859
This junior, Chen Yuanqi, greets Uncle Jiang.

5
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,460
I may have offended you by coming today.

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,560
I hope you can forgive me.

7
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,600
I have a request to make.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,719
I wish to borrow your Jiang family's Soul Jade.

9
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,299
At least you know some manners.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,719
However,

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,159
Why do you want to borrow our Soul Jade?

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
My mother was wounded by Dugu Zhantian.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,799
Her soul is damaged.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,539
I heard the Jiang family's Soul Jade can heal her.

15
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:03,320
That's why I came to ask.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,599
How dare you challenge the authority of the Jiang family!

17
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,879
If we don't punish you,

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,859
every Tom, Dick, and Harry will dare to barge in.

19
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,079
Seal his cultivation.

20
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,700
Imprison him for life in the Guanghan Dungeon as a warning.

21
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,659
Brother Yuanqi, be careful!

22
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,120
It's fine.

23
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,000
Elders, please enlighten me.

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,459
If you can withstand a single strike from me today,

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,019
I, Chen Yuanqi,

26
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,340
will never touch a sword again.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,060
This brat dares to boast!

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,819
Do you think you're the Sword Saint of this era?

29
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,519
Then watch closely.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,019
Decree of Heaven Sword Art!

31
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,060
Southern Sky Sword!

32
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,439
Sparks Ignite the Prairie!

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,379
Blade, come!

34
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,120
I didn't expect that in such a short time,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,500
your cultivation has reached level sixty.

36
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,099
Within your sword aura,

37
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,420
there is a faint hint

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,740
of a top expert's power.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,740
It's truly frightening.

40
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,659
Thank you for your recognition, Uncle Jiang.

41
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't get ahead of yourself.

42
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,120
Dugu Zhantian has returned.

43
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,419
Yumeng is destined to marry into a noble family.

44
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,800
To help our Jiang family through this crisis.

45
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,699
All four great families are the same.

46
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,719
They think they're above everyone else.

47
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,300
But they're nothing, really.

48
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,699
Uncle Jiang.

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,939
I am determined to obtain the Soul Jade.

50
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Yumeng's marriage

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,620
should not be a tool for any family's alliance.

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,860
She is a living person.

53
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,520
Her life

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,780
is hers to choose.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,740
You...

56
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,340
A true man

57
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,539
must never betray a woman's trust.

58
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,939
She has promised to stay with me forever.

59
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,539
No matter what happens,

60
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,400
I, Chen Yuanqi,

61
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,300
will never back down.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,879
You want to borrow the Soul Jade,

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,159
and propose marriage.

64
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,979
You must first pass through our Jiang family's Secret Realm.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,800
Those who pass the Secret Realm

66
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,599
if they are a Jiang family member,

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,780
will be eligible to inherit.

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,080
If an outsider is recognized,

69
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,719
he can become our family's chosen son-in-law.

70
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
But if you fail,

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
you will die without a complete corpse.

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,319
What?

73
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,520
Jiang family's Secret Realm...

74
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,319
Father truly intends to kill.

75
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,780
Do you dare?

76
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,259
Father.

77
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,560
The last time an outsider was recognized by the Secret Realm

78
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,620
was a hundred years ago.

79
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,379
You're clearly making things difficult for Yuanqi.

80
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,180
So what if I am?

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,280
If he lacks even this courage,

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,659
he should just leave now.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,479
Don't embarrass yourself here.

84
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,020
This time, the Soul Jade

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,740
will be the prize for the martial contest.

86
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,439
The winner may marry Yumeng.

87
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,979
If a Jiang family disciple wins,

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,740
he will become the heir.

89
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:14,340
Fine.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,620
Uncle Jiang.

91
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,300
Since that's the case,

92
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,860
then I,

93
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,019
will bravely take on the challenge.

94
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,579
Who is this poor upstart?

95
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,939
Why did he follow us into the Jiang Family's Secret Realm?

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,139
Probably wants to latch onto our Jiang Family.

97
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,699
Doesn't even know his own place.

98
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,959
Is he even worthy?

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
Just look at you.

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
No matter where you go, people dislike you, Chen Yuanqi.

101
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,360
You people,

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,939
only judge others by their background.

103
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,019
You're not even half as good as my Brother Yuanqi.

104
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,600
Enough.

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,839
Everyone here is a talented youth from noble families.

106
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,240
You are here for the Secret Realm trial.

107
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
I hope you all perform well.

108
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,680
And earn the Soul Jade's gift of cultivation.

109
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:04,759
Father,

110
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,560
I ask to enter the Secret Realm with Yuanqi.

111
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,800
Nonsense!

112
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,079
Do you know this trial is an ancestral tradition?

113
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,439
It has always been for the men of our clan only.

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,660
I understand.

115
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,540
But according to Jiang Family rules,

116
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,759
outsiders must pass the Secret Realm to become a son-in-law.

117
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,839
Jiang Family members must complete the trial

118
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,360
to have a chance to inherit your legacy.

119
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,519
And become clan leader.

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,160
I want to try.

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,600
How can this be allowed?

122
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,139
Clan head, this must not happen!

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,259
How can a woman take a seat at the table?

124
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,639
No woman has ever led the Jiang Family.

125
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,180
If word gets out,

126
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,220
what will other families think of us?

127
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:54,839
Elders,

128
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:55,920
Clan leader,

129
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,079
This junior has a question.

130
00:05:58,939 --> 00:05:59,959
Do you know

131
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:02,379
that Dugu Zhantian has returned to the martial world?

132
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,899
The clan leader already informed us.

133
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,959
We don't need you to remind us.

134
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,879
I have another question.

135
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,579
Among you,

136
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,240
has anyone ever fought Dugu Zhantian?

137
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,259
Ridiculous.

138
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,879
A villain of that caliber

139
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,500
can't be defeated by less than a hundred men.

140
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,540
But if he were here,

141
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,899
hundreds of Jiang Family members would charge at him.

142
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
We might just bring him down.

143
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,579
And show the Jiang Family's might.

144
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,180
The real joke is you.

145
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,860
Hundreds of people?

146
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,279
Yumeng only had three people with her back then.

147
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,180
Yet she dared to point her sword at Dugu Zhantian.

148
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,600
And brought back such vital information to your Jiang Family.

149
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,699
If she isn't worthy to take a seat at the table,

150
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,819
then wouldn't that

151
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,639
put all the men here to shame?

152
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,980
Such an important matter

153
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,220
was actually discovered by Yumeng.

154
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,879
That's impressive.

155
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,819
Isn't it?

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,339
Such courage—

157
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
how many in our clan could do the same?

158
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,439
Enough, Yumeng.

159
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,120
We permit you to join this Secret Realm trial.

160
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,720
Thank you, Father.

161
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,259
Everyone,

162
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
this Secret Realm of the Hall

163
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,639
was created by our Jiang family ancestors.

164
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,980
It is truly unique.

165
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,019
It connects to another world.

166
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,899
Another world?

167
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,079
That's right.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
Within this Secret Realm,

169
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,000
you can sense ancient poems from many worlds.

170
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,279
Touch the Spirit Inquiry Stone and they appear.

171
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,360
Recite the poem to gain spiritual power.

172
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,279
No wonder the Jiang family leads the four great clans.

173
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:42,959
With such a Secret Realm,

174
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,420
how could our disciples not excel?

175
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,860
The Spirit Inquiry Stone shows the poem's compatibility.

176
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,759
The higher the compatibility,

177
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,160
the brighter the glow.

178
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,660
The Soul Jade grants even greater spiritual power.

179
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,439
If your cultivation is lacking and you force a recitation,

180
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,980
your meridians will shatter.

181
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,620
You will die instantly.

182
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,139
Look!

183
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,540
The legendary golden glow has appeared!

184
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,220
Goose, goose, goose,

185
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,120
Curved neck singing to the sky.

186
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,079
White feathers float on emerald water.

187
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,139
Red feet push clear waves.

188
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,420
It's a complete poem!

189
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,680
A masterpiece.

190
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:21,980
That's incredible.

191
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,079
White feathers, green water.

192
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,680
Red feet, clear waves.

193
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,060
One floats, one pushes.

194
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,180
Vivid and skillfully worded.

195
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,159
What a fine "Ode to the Goose."

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,639
They recite masterpieces with ease.

197
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,940
What can you do, Chen Yuanqi?

198
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,220
Just stand there staring.

199
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,220
Brother Yuanqi,

200
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,419
they're just lucky.

201
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,919
You're the truly talented one.

202
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,639
See that, Chen Yuanqi?

203
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,500
That's a masterpiece.

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,039
I don't believe you can recite

205
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,740
a poem more exquisite than "Ode to the Goose."

206
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,539
Your cultivation

207
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,059
isn't worthy of Yu Meng.

208
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,399
You're just a frog in a well.

209
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,720
Short-sighted.

210
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,000
You can't do it.

211
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,539
Doesn't mean I can't recite something better.

212
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,779
Then go ahead and recite.

213
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,200
You've been silent for ages.

214
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,399
I see so many great poems from other worlds.

215
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,299
I can't finish reciting them all.

216
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Listen up.

217
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,899
Among all birds and beasts,

218
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,799
dragon, phoenix, tortoise, and qilin reign supreme.

219
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,259
So today,

220
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:22,139
I will recite a poem

221
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,919
about a divine beast and my own feelings.

222
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,200
Prepare to be amazed.

223
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,059
Such arrogance.

224
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,019
With your ordinary eyes,

225
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,899
if you can witness such a poem,

226
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,159
I'll serve you like a horse or ox.

227
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,860
I'll kowtow three times and bow nine.

228
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,679
Fine.

229
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:42,399
Then get ready to kneel.

230
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,559
Such boastful words.
