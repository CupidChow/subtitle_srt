[Episode 26]

4
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,950
Are you making a wish?

5
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,100
A wish for you.

6
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,130
For the peace of the six realms.

7
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,240
For understanding between humans and spirits,

8
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
lesser disputes,

9
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,770
and eternal peace.

10
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,590
How's your wound

11
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,220
recovering?

12
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,060
Do you want the truth or the lie?

13
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,910
The truth first.

14
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,070
The truth is I hope it'll never heal.

15
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,480
Then I can...

16
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,310
stay by your side forever.

17
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,500
And the lie?

18
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,080
It's not healed.

19
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,950
You're in the mood to be cheeky.

20
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,280
It means

21
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,240
Dongfang Luo's medicine

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,370
is quite effective.

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
By the way,

24
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,490
how's the investigation of the one

25
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,710
who imitated the Claw of Insulation

26
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,770
and killed Chi Shan

27
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
at Spirit Market?

28
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,800
There's still

29
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,079
no progress yet.

30
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,970
Have you ever thought

31
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,420
he might be close to you?

32
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,680
I mean,

33
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,500
he must be familiar with your schedule.

34
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,510
That's why he knew to trap you

35
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,520
while you went to the pharmacy.

36
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,800
What's your point?

37
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,120
If it's someone

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,550
you trust and care a lot,

39
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,980
what would you do?

40
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,970
I once did something regretful

41
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
because I didn't trust you.

42
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I won't make

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,570
the same mistake again.

44
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,040
Wait.

45
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,070
Would you believe

46
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,760
what I say?

47
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,860
Why would I? We aren't longtime friends.

48
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,140
Good wine indeed.

49
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
You haven't recovered yet,

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,490
and you invited me for drinks without talking.

51
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,280
What's up?

52
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,040
Lai.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,190
Tell me the truth.

54
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,450
Did Honghong forget me?

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,940
I'd better just drink.

56
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,510
I knew it.

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,720
No wonder...

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,160
Did someone do something to Honghong

59
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,750
and made her forget me?

60
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,290
It must be that spy.

61
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,390
Haven't you been looking for

62
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,310
Shi Ji's spy?

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,830
Stop with your

64
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,600
far-fetched theories.

65
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,540
But I can promise you

66
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,000
one thing.

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,450
No one did anything to Chief.

68
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,730
Or else, she wouldn’t have just forgotten you.

69
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,690
Then why did she only forget me?

70
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,130
That's the crux of the question.

71
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,240
But in my opinion,

72
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,800
if she'd only forgotten you,

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,770
it must be a choice she made.

74
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,240
Why else would she still remember

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,120
others like me,

76
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,990
Yaya,

77

78
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,270
You mean

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,070
she's choosing

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,690
not to remember me?

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,450
No way.

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,300
You have to believe it.

83
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,620
Learn to accept facts.

84
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,610
Don't humans always say

85
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,490
there are plenty more fish in the sea?

86
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,040
But I just love one fish.

87
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,520
We humans have another saying:

88
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
"At most, I'll just start all over again."

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,000
So what if

90
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,640
Honghong's forgotten me

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,390
and our past?

92
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,380
I have plenty of time

93
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,000
to make new memories with her.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,650

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,090

96

No matter what,

97
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,720
I won't give up on pursuing Honghong.

98
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,950
I'll go back if there's nothing else.

99

Chi Shan's blood on him.

103
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,840
Luo has a special place in Honghong's heart.

104
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Before we have more evidence,

105
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,800
she might not believe this.

106
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,360
But I'm afraid Luo

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,490
will harm Honghong.

108
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,510

all the women who were duped by him

116
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,440
complained he used spiritual spells

117
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,040
to play with their feelings.

118
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,150
By Yiqi Alliance's law,

119
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,030
it's a sentence

120

of 100 years in Huntian Prison.

121

Prior to this,

122
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,080
you defended him in front of Director,

123
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,770
saying he helped you capture evil spirits.

124
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,640

I dare not.

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Director is wise.

130
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,120
Since Yan Rushan violated the law,

131
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,250
he should be held responsible for it.

132

This evil spirits' prison break

133

Don't say anything else.

195
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,910
Just answer them.

196
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,320
Okay.

197
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,270
I'll start now.

198
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,490
Who else is in the carriage other than me,

199
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,600
Lyu Jianwen?

200
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,120
Me,

201
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Yan Rushan.

202
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,810
Are you willing to accept

203
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,440
Yiqi Alliance's verdict according to the law?

204
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,640
Yes.

205
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,640
Do you swear not to play with women's feelings again?

206
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,410
I swear.

207
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,000
Who are you with now?

208
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,630
Lyu Jianwen.

209
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,150
When fish are in trouble,

210
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,750
in order to survive,

211
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,600
they use saliva

212
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,630
to wet each other's body.

213
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,730
What's the idiom for this?

214
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,240
Sharing weal and woe.

215
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,810
How long will you spend

216
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,570
atoning for your sins?

217
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,780
For life.

218
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,790
You captured Chi Sha Bandits' evil spirits

219
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,030
at the cost of your freedom.

220
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,670
Do you regret it?

221
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,360
Answer me.

222
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,960
No regrets.

223
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,420
♫When the moon recedes into the horizon♫

224
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,310
♫Looking up from afar, the stars connect into lines♫

225
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,300
♫Connecting into your eyes and brows♫

226
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,810
♫Connecting into your smiling face♫

♫How can I forget it?♫

228
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,150
I,

229
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,840
Yan Rushan,

230
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,310
swear to

231
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,820
♫Who can hear my gaze♫

232
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,980

♫Speaking about love♫

234
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870

♫Silently yearning♫

♫Who can hear my world♫

♫That's my troubles roaring like thunder♫

242

♫As I run towards you♫

244
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,290
the first time I saw you,

245
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,930
I already knew

246
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,380
♫I missed you silently for a moment♫

247
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,860
you were a kind spirit.

248
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,920
You just didn't know

249
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,180
♫Listen, the wind is blowing, and it's raining lovesickness♫

250

♫As memories pour from the sky♫

252
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,860
so you made so many mistakes.

253
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,920
But you've been trying to correct yourself

254
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,430
♫It's an inch of my life, an inch of my heart♫

255
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,690

♫It's my unresolved woe♫

257
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,550
Several times,

258
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,010
you even risked your life for me.

259
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,070
♫Listen♫

260
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,570
♫The wind blows and makes my heart flutter♫

262

No matter how many years

263
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,690
you'll spend in jail,

264
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,260
♫Love and hate are related to you♫

265
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,990
I will...

♫Our meeting was not in vain♫

267
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
I'll wait for you.

268
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,640
What a stubborn and smart girl.

269
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,480
Grief Tree.

270
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,130
Did you hear my disciple's oath?

271
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,590
Will Rushan

272
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
realize Jianwen's efforts?

273
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,160
With his personality,

274
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,220
it might be hard for him

275
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,040
to read between the lines.

276
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,720
Anyway,

277
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,360
I hope this is a good start for them.

278
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,510
Making a wish under Grief Tree

279
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,480
is no joke.

280
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,610
Rushan's sentence is long.

281
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,760
Will you regret

282
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,420
doing this?

283
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,500
I'm just worried this tree

284
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
only protects love between spirits

285
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
and won't sympathize

286
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,050
with a human like me who fell for a spirit.

287
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,230
As long as it's true love,

288
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,770
Grief Tree will feel it.

289
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,319
Hopefully

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,069
that's the case.

291
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,400
However,

292
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,420
even if we can't be together in this life,

293
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,930
I believe

294
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,619
we'll reunite in another way.

295
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,400
Constable Lyu.

296
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,670
With all due respect,

297
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,599
since you love him so much,

298
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,790
why don't you

299
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,590
confess your love to him?

300
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,230
You don't want Rushan

301
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,590
to know you're suffering for him?

302
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,710
It's not suffering.

303
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,310
It's sweet.

304
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,850
Loving someone

305
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,000
is a kind of happiness.

306
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,140
How is

307
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,170
his injury?

308
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
I just checked on him.

309
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,550
In a few days,

310
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,270
he'll be fully healed.

311
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,450
Then

312
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,210
he can return to Yiqi Alliance.

313
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,240
Have you forgotten

314
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,280
he was sent by Yiqi Alliance?

315
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,050
How could I forget?

316
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,140
You said you haven't been sleeping well.

317
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,840
This

318
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:41,930
calming incense

319
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,860
can help you rest well.

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,720
Find a chance

321
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,060
to bring Tushan Honghong out.

322
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,250
Mr. Luo has the upper hand.

323
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,530
The market is so far from Huguang Pavilion.

324
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,590
Yuechu will probably lose this time.

325
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,400
Yes.

326
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,790
Mr. Luo is so nice to Chief,

327
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,960
visiting her at such a late hour.

328
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,260
Before this,

329
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,930
I was trapped in the darkness.

330
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,970
Only you

331
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,390
came to see me again and again

332
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,200
and talked to me.

333
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,490
So I could endure that period.

334
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,880
You are my only one.

335
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,440
But...

336
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,000
if it weren't for Dongfang Yuechu,

337
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
I'd also be your only one.

338
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,700
Yuechu!

339
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,960
Dongfang Luo.

340
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,710
Who are you?

341
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
It doesn't matter who I am.

342
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,970
What matters is

343
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,750
I can help you get Tushan Honghong.

344
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,740
I'll give you longevity

345
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,030
and let you be together forever.

346
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,580
When Spirit Lord takes over the six realms,

347
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,510
our souls will always

348
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,640
be in the dark together.

349
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,300
Then

350
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,810
we won't be lonely.

351
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,960
But...

352
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,620
will you hate me?

353
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,350
Chief.

354
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,800
Come in.

355
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,110
Luo, you're here

356
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,980
at this hour?

357
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,400
Prince Lai.

358
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,760
What's with Chief?

359
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,280
It’s just a calming incense

360
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,690
for her to rest well.

361
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,460
She's been too tired lately.

362
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,090
You can even

363
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,440
make incense?

364
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,550
It does smell good.

365
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,930
Thank you for your care.

366
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,580
I’ve known Honghong for long.

367
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,430
Now,

368
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,650
she is my only tie in this world.

369
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,160
It's natural for me to focus on her.

370
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
I see.

371
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,320
Now that Chief is resting,

372
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,370
I have

373
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,200
some questions about

374
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,160
making incense.

375
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,190
Could you give me some guidance?

376
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,140
Of course.

377
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:56,810
Let's talk

378
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,570
on the way.

379
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,160
Please.

380
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,270
Thyme, colorful birchleaf, and cypress.

381
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,990
To think these can be used to make incense too.

382
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,570
Luo, you sure are smart.

383
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,560
You flatter me, Prince Lai.

384
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,950
I just follow what I read

385
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,790
in ancient books.

386
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,700
It's getting late.

387
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,850
You have to rush back to Twin Peaks.

388
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,980
I won't send you off.

389
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,370
Goodbye.

390
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,320
Yuechu, buddy.

391
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,980
Why are you still up so late?

392
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,370
Aren't you staying up

393
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,930
in Honghong's room?

394
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,030
Did Lai tell you?

395
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,470
I have many friends in Tushan.

396
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,990
It's easy to get your news.

397
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,240
Honghong doesn't like incense.

398
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,640
She needs to stay sober at all times.

399
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,640
Do you think

400
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,360
you know Honghong well?

401
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,650
Don't forget

402
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,220
I've known her longer than you.

403
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,790
For centuries,

404
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,650
every time she was troubled,

405
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,600
she'd come here and tell me.

406
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,230
I know every moment

407
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,430
of her fear and sorrow.

408
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,560
So what?

409
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,040
Do you know why your eyes are in front of you?

410
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,730
Because looking forward

411
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,830
is more important than the past.

412
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,030
You should know best

413
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,210
about Honghong's choice.

414
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,230
That's because she hasn't seen

415
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,390
your true colors.

416
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,240
What do you mean?

417
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,820
No matter how well you hide it,

418
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,690
you'll be exposed one day.

419
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,330
Since we can't be friends,

420
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,610
let's not force it.

421
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,750
Studying medical books requires silence.

422
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,070
If there's nothing else,

423
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,330
don't come here again.

424
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,720
Dongfang Luo.

425
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,880
Honghong trusts you unconditionally

426
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,940
because of her guilt.

427
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,790
I hope you'll get back on the right path.

428
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,960
Don't let her down.

429
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,320
Nothing counts

430
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,410
without evidence.

431
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,450
Evidence?

432
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,640
I'll get it.

433
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,960
When Chi Shan died,

434
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,130
Dongfang Luo was in the pharmacy

435
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,120
and never left?

436
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,920
Yes.

437
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
I'd been watching him here.

438
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,630
He did get medicine here

439
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,740
and never left.

440
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,110
It can't be.

441
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,520
Doctor.

442
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,420
Coming.

443
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,890
Here, have some water.

444
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,470
Are you managing the pharmacy

445
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,000
all by yourself?

446
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,170
Yes.

447
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
In that case,

448
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,870
you must be busy.

449
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,790
Yes.

450
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm the only pharmacy in the market.

451
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,800
I've to tend to

452
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,510
all the customers.

453
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,510
In that case,

454
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,890
how did you have time

455
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,720
to accompany Dongfang Luo then?

456
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,200
Well...

457
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,080
I can't remember.

458
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,660
It doesn't make sense.

459
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,920
Maybe that day

460
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,530
was just an exception.

461
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,910
It's not an exception.

462
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
It's the fox spell

463
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,130
that made the doctor think he was always here.

464
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,880
Dongfang Luo.

465
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,640
Don't you want evidence?

466
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,240
Come out!

467
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,790
I'll show it to you now.

468
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,920
Dongfang Luo!

469
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,260
Come out!

470
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,330
Come out!

471
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,570
What evidence do you have?

472
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,150
Honghong.

473
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,810
I know you trust Luo.

474
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,720
But under scrutiny,

475
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,530
something's off with his awakening.

476
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,090
Don't you suspect him?

477
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:20,800
No.

478
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,610
I've been with him for centuries

479
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,000
just for him to wake up.

480
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,990
Even so,

481
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,380
everyone advised you not to go

482
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,930
to Fire Dragon Valley then.

483
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,240
But he developed the antidote right on time

484
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,770
such that you were in danger

485
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,320
and almost killed by Shi Ji.

486
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,680
Spirit and Yiqi Alliances

487
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,880
planned to join hands

488
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,850
to catch spirits in Fire Dragon Valley.

489
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,920
I was going anyway.

490
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,570
Why get him involved?

491
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,430
How do you explain Jianwen smelling

492
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,760
Chi Shan's blood on him?

493
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,510
That day,

494
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,310
Dongfang Luo and I examined

495
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,210
Chi Shan's corpse together.

496
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,770
Maybe it was stained then.

497
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,350
But why isn't it on you?

498
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,360
It's all just your guess.

499
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,530
Why are you so sure he's the murderer?

500
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,450
You haven't known Luo for long.

501
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,780
You don’t know him well.

502
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,520
When I met him centuries ago,

503
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,390
spirits and humans were at war.

504
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,430
Only he

505
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,890
believed in peace between humans and spirits.

506
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,630
How could such a person

507
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,400
harm anyone?

508
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:33,940
Yes.

509
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,010
Maybe he was so centuries ago.

510
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,660
But what about now?

511
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,530
Have you ever thought

512
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,060
that you're blinded

513
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,480
not by your trust

514
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,110
but your feelings for him?

515
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,130
You're right.

516
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,960
I've never suspected him.

517
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,200
But...

518
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,160
Enough.

519
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,750
I know your feelings for him.

520
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,760
Don't repeat it.

521
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,590
At this point,

522
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,400
it's up to you

523
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,890
to be wary of Luo.

524
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,710
Bye.

525
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,540
Honghong.

526
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,330
Why are you here?

527
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,000
I came to see you.

528
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,750
Why are you studying outside the cave?

529
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,470
It's funny.

530
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,140
Countless foxes

531
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,420
come to me for guidance every day.

532
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,830
I couldn't stand it.

533
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,160
So I changed locations.

534
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,340
I was careless.

535
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,330
I'll order them

536
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,890
to stop bothering you.

537
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,520
No need.

538
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,610
Although the foxes are naughty,

539
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,660
they're diligent in learning.

540
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,720
When I woke up,

541
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,300
centuries had passed.

542
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,150
Thanks to their company,

543
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,710
I don't feel

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,240
redundant.

545
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,020
If you're worried,

546
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,410
why must you leave?

547
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,970
I can't persuade Honghong,

548
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,600
so I've to find another way.

549
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,000
Fortunately, Fu Cheng's woken up.

550
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,780
I can start from her

551
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,610
to figure out

552
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,440
these conspiracies.

553
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,070
That's good too.

554
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,110
By the way,

555
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,560
Dongfang Luo

556
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,360
gave me this cultivation manual.

557
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,040
[Emptiness Magic]

558
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,660
He claims it's a long-lost secret technique of the Dongfangs.

559
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,660
Emptiness Magic?

560
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,030
I've read it many times,

561
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,910
but I didn't find anything wrong.

562
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,240
Why do they want me to cultivate

563
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,370
this skill?

564
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,330
I understand what you mean.

565
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,680
I'll go back and study it.

566
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,540
I'll inform you

567
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,620
if I have anything.

568
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,510
Okay.

569
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,580
After I leave,

570
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,070
please watch Dongfang Luo.

571
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,030
Don't let Honghong get hurt.

572
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,170
Don't worry.

573
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,270
Bye.

574
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,120
After days of non-stop rain,

575
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,150
it's finally sunny.

576
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,040
Why are you here?

577
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,440
Fu Feng

578
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,290
was always on duty.

579
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,680
It seems you'd rather

580
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,480
see Fu Feng than me.

581
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,900
Of course not.

582
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,730
I haven't given you a thank you gift.

583
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,290
I've asked the director

584
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,170
to let me come here

585
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
every five days.

586
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,160
Why?

587
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,440
Yiqi Alliance has changed the law.

588
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,590
Jailbreakers will be killed.

589
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,350
Yan Rushan.

590
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,110
Can you promise me

591
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,120
to reflect properly in here

592
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,160
until your sentence is over?

593
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,700
Why are you so concerned

594
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,850
about me?

595
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,270
Do you agree or not?

596
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,410
I promise you.

597
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,930
I'll be good and receive my punishment here.

598
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,200
I won't escape prison and hurt others

599
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,080
like Chi Lei.

600
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,070
It's a deal.

601
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,510
[Zhilan Garden]

602
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,850
Are you in a bad mood?

603
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,560
Did you hit a wall with Honghong?

604
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,030
What are you on about?

605
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,260
Si Xi said

606
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,400
when he was around,

607
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,220
you always racked your brains to look for Honghong.

608
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,460
With your temper,

609
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,020
if she didn't kick you out,

610
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,550
how could you've come back?

611
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,070
Lai said

612
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,100
to drink your medicine

613
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,150
while it's hot.

614
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,390
Drink it.

615
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,030
Stop thinking so much.

616
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,260
It's so bitter.

617
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,740
So bitter?

618
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,670
Look at you.

619
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,440
You've suffered so much

620
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,830
mentally and physically,

621
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,490
but you've never complained.

622
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,370
Now, even medicine's too bitter?

623
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,360
It's up to me.

624
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:30,850
Candy?

625
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Look at how fierce

626
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,050
and unreasonable you are.

627
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,100
Planning to stay in Divine Flame Villa

628
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
just because you can't get married?

629
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,940
Who said I'm getting married?

630
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,240
Right.

631
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,170
A matrilocal husband's fine too.

632
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,410
Aunt Yu Ping and I can watch you.

633
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,030
Then you won't scare that husband away.

634
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,330
What's with this nonsense?

635
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,330
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

636
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,560
The priority now

637
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,260
is to find out who abducted you

638
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,030
back then.

639
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:11,830
I see.

640
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,040
That's why you came back.

641
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,420
Not only me.

642
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,620
As a disciple of Yiqi Alliance,

643
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,850
you have the responsibility

644
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,380
to figure this out quickly.

645
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,840
It seems Lyu Jianwen and Yan Rushan

646
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,460
truly love each other.

647
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,100
But

648
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,560
Rushan's now in Huntian Prison.

649
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,420
Jianwen also doesn't want him

650
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,620
to know her feelings.

651
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,610
This task

652
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,180
will be tricky.

653
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,290
Honghong.

654
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,050
One more thing.

655
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,980
Yuechu

656
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,980
returned to Divine Flame Villa.

657
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,980
When will

658
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,680
Yuechu come back again?

659
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
He and Chief...

660
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm worried for him.

661
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,270
Worry about yourself first.

662
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey.

663
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,960
Why's your salary

664
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,190
lesser this month?

665
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,760
In this way,

666
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,290
it'll take forever to save up for our wedding.

667
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,630
Well...

668
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,320
When Yuechu came back,

669
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
you told me

670
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,070
to take care of him.

671
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,130
You'd better have spent it on Yuechu.

672
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,400
Otherwise,

673
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,110
you're just asking for it!

674
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,440
Jiushuang.

675
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm telling the truth.

676
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,670
I'm not lying.

677
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,910
She used to be gentle and lovely.

678
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,100
Why did she become like this

679
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,300
after we got into a relationship?

680
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,230
What did you say?

681
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,110
No...

682
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,860
Nothing.

683
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,860
Jiushuang.

684
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,840
Look!

685
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,550
So many meteors!

686
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,230
Looks like Grief Tree's sent a divine mission.

687
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,900
The tree must've acknowledged

688
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,430
Rushan and Jianwen's love!

689
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,080
I knew it.

690
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,440
They're the only ones

691
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,840
who came to Tushan to seek marriage lately.

692
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,000
So the power of love is still strong.

693
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,100
Of course.

694
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,120
Look at that cloud.

695
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,250
It's so pretty.

696
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,400
Honghong.

697
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,150
All spirits and humans at the market

698
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,680
on the day of Chi Shan's murder

699
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,850
are on this list.

700
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,070
Does anyone else know about this?

701
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,280
Don't worry.

702
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,390
As you instructed,

703
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,190
Lai and I investigated secretly

704
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,740
without alerting others.

705
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,630
Dongfang Luo?

706
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,890
Dongfang Luo...

707
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,380
He's the kindest.

708
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,070
He saved Honghong and Rongrong's lives.

709
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,760
He'd never

710
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,860
kill anyone.

711
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,880
Besides, Luo's a nerd.

712
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,630
With his cultivation,

713
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
he can't handle

714
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,700
even three moves from Chi Shan.

715
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,380
How could he imitate the Claw of Insulation?

716
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,170
It's been so many days.

717
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,560
How dare you report empty-handed?

718
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,430
It seems you still can't

719
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,260
make a move on Honghong.

720
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,160
I dare not.

721
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,300
Since returning from Fire Dragon Valley,

722
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,900
Tushan's tightened security

723
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,360
to investigate Chi Shan's murder secretly.

724
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,960
Yuechu's also interfering.

725
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,170
So,

726
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,410
my several attempts

727
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
have failed.

728
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,590
If you can't make a move within Tushan,

729
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,200
what about outside?

730
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,430
Useless!

731
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,130
How about this?

732
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,690
In seven days,

733
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,810
find a way to lure Honghong to Setting Moon River.

734
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
Leave the rest

735
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,840
to me.

736
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,230
Seven days

737
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is feasible.

738
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,700
But I need your power, Spirit Lord.

739
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,390
Spit it out!

740
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Honghong received a new divine mission

741
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,170
to facilitate Rushan and Jianwen's relationship.

742
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:50,830
We can use it

743
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,880
to lure Honghong out.

744
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,530
This is a way indeed.
