00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,590
Boss.

5
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,640
I've organized

6
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,900
all the files of Huntian Prison inmates.

7
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,570
Yan Rushan's birthday is on the first day of next month?

8
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,680
Yes.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,060
Is there a problem?

10
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,199
No.

11
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,310
Well,

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,470
how do you usually celebrate your birthday?

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,060
Birthdays?

14
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,490
I've never had any birthday celebrations.

15
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,870
I remember one year,

16
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,710
my wife

17
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,480
cooked a bowl of noodles for me.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,930
But she cooks for you every day.

19
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,130
What's so special?

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,430
It's different.

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,270
Think about it.

22
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,360
Eating noodles on one's birthday means longevity.

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,910
My wife wants me to live long.

24
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,910
You're not on duty today.

25
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,210
Why are you here?

26
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,940
Have you forgotten what day it is?

27
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,630
What day?

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,000
The first day of the month.

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,710
You mean

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,070
my birthday?

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,570
Over centuries,

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
I've never celebrated it

33
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,829
that I even forgot it.

37
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Where is the soup?

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,910
I brought it over right after cooking it.

39
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,240
Why is it already mushy?

40
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,470
You...

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
made it yourself?

42
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,840
But now...

43
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,110
Is it good?

44
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,690
Is it good?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

46
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,160
But why do you look like that?

47
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,080
It's good!

48
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,630
Really?

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,060
Delicious.

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,550
I knew

51
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,400

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,810

You know what?

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
Fu Feng and the others often criticize my cooking.

55
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,160
Let me try it.

56
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,210

57
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm hungry.

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,400
Eat more then.

60
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,070
Did you arrange this?

61
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,070
Of course not.

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,870
We constables are always clean.

63
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,570
We earn just enough for food.

64
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,590
How can I afford this?

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,610
But who cares?

66
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,950
Let's watch it.

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,160
Are you...

68

69
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,680
Getting married?

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,190
Yes.

71
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,990
Fu Feng told me you went on a blind date.

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Right?

73
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,310

and gathering herbs outside sometimes.

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,440
Nothing seems unusual.

79
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,950
I asked you to protect him secretly,

80
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,090
not monitor him.

81
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,490

recording his routine.

83
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,630
But do you really

84
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,750
trust Luo so undoubtedly?

85
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,940
Trust is necessary,

86
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,420
but it should be based on objective

87
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,230
observations and assessments.

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Blind trust

89
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
is not wise.

90
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,000
What's your point?

91
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,010
I'm worried

93
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,500

and even Dongfang Luo,

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,760
it might be detrimental.

Yaya's gone to spy on Nangong Shi.

99
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,100
Since he's working with Shi Ji,

100
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,800
there must be secret schemes.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,530
Wait and see.

102

Everything will come to light.

103
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
I hope so.

104
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,720
But before that,

105

Don't worry.

I heard it's poisoning.

118
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,460
How could

119

a bull spirit who's unafraid of poison

120
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,010
get poisoned suddenly?

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,170
Besides,

122
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,730
Huntian Prison's so heavily guarded

123
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,560

When was he poisoned?

Nothing.

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,049
I'll go check.

150

not to scold me behind my back.

152

Come in.

153
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,900
Don't act all mysterious.

154
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,080
Just spit it out.

Honghong sent you to spy on the Nangongs?

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,030
How did you know?

158
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,770
Honghong doesn't admit it,

159
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,880
but it's undisputed

160
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,100
that I, Dongfang Yuechu,

161
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,900

What?

164

Forget it then.

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Tell me.

166
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,550
Nangong Shi went to Huntian Prison.

167

Move!

Excuse me!

Step aside!

What's the rush?

175
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,150
Did something happen again?

176
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,840
I heard

177
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,240
a Constable Lyu of Yiqi Alliance is missing.

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Even a constable can go missing?

179
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,790
We must be careful.

180
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,470
Why would Lyu Jianwen disappear?

181
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
I know why he went to Huntian Prison.

182
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Yaya.

Patriarch Nangong?

189
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,510
You must be disappointed to see me.

190
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,810
I know who you're waiting for.

191
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,470
But she will

192
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,020
never appear again.

193
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:18,860
What do you mean?

194
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,750
Lyu Jianwen

195
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,550
was abducted on her way

to Huntian Prison.

197
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,190
Who knows if she's dead or alive?

198
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,450
Impossible.

199
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,320
She must be

200
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,020
delayed by something.

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,150
Everyone

202
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,700
in Yiqi Alliance

203
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,550
knows about this.

204
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,000
You can ask around to confirm it.

205
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,570
Unfortunately,

206
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,590
our beautiful Constable Lyu

207
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,080
is now

208
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,840
in the palm of the devil.

209
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,530
Who knows if she's dead or alive?

210
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,330
We aren't relatives or friends.

211
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,090
Why did you come here to tell me?

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,390
Because I can't bear to see lovers

213
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,410
be separated forever.

214
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,480
What do you mean?

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,240
What do you mean?

216
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,350
I've delivered the news.

217
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
It's up to you

218
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,640
what to do next.

219
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,490
Don't worry.

220
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,830
In the future,

221
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,800
I'll be magnanimous

222
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,510
and let you attend

223
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,550
Lyu Jianwen's funeral.

224
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,600
What do you mean?

225
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,610
Nangong Shi!

226
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,080
What do you mean?

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,400
Nangong Shi!

228
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,960
Yan Rushan loved you deeply.

229
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,200
That's why it's a divine bond.

230
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,660
He loves you so much.

231
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,310
If he sees you in danger,

232
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,120
do you think

233
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,670
he will come to save you?

234
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,200
At this moment,

235
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,380
I just need to give him a little push

236
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,780
and he'll be swayed.

237
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,210
For you,

238
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,960
he'll risk his life to escape prison.

239
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,180
Stop knocking!

240
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,030
So noisy!

241
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,900
Behave!

242
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,560
Tell me.

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Who captured Lyu Jianwen?

244
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,840
How do you know that?

245
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,150
She can't die.

246
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,320
She must live!

247
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,950
Why aren't you escaping?

248
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,050
Your beloved is in danger,

249
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,780
waiting for you to save her.

250
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,270
Let me out.

251
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,360
Let me out!

252
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,140
Let me out!

253
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
Let me out!

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,360
What do you want?

255
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,900
Based on Yiqi Alliance's new law,

256
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,970
if Rushan takes a step out of Huntian Prison,

257
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,600
he'll be executed.

258
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,510
What do you have against

259
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,630
Yan Rushan?

260
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,480
Only in this way

261
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,700
can I make Tushan Honghong come to meet her death.

262
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,130
Darn it.

263
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,770
Can you promise me

264
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,640
to reflect properly here

265
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,530
until your sentence is over?

266
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,560
I promise you.

267
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,220
I'll be good and receive punishment in here.

268
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
It's a deal.

269
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,870
My bull horn's aura is fading.

270
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,040
If I can protect her,

271
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,150
so what if I die?

272
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,610
Patriarch went out for something.

273
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,870
He asked for the nobleman

274
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,140
to wait in the study.

275
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,000
Nobleman?

276
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,890
According to info from Yuechu and Yaya,

277
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,480
Yan Rushan's escaped prison to save Lyu Jianwen.

278
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,210
And the nobleman showed up at Nangong Residence.

279
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,150
Did you just say

280
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,710
Yuechu submitted

281
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,550
the evidence of Nangong Shi colluding with evil spirits

282
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,570
to Yiqi Alliance?

283
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,980
That's what it says in Yuechu's letter.

284
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,290
We'll go to Nangong Residence.

285
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,340
Inform Wangquan Villa

286
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,020
to join us

287
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,250
to make an arrest there tonight.

288
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,340
Okay.

289
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,370
Sorry to keep you waiting,

290
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,250
Nobleman.

291
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,500
Is everything going well?

292
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,830
Don't worry.

293
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,350
I saw Rushan escape with my own eyes.

294
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,350
It'll depend on when Honghong makes a move.

295
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,830
I wonder what your plan is at Setting Moon River.

296
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,650
How do you know about that?

297
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,280
Did you plant something on Lyu Jianwen?

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,450
I'm just concerned.

299
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,260
After all, we need to discuss the bigger scheme in the future.

300
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:24,160
Sir.

301
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,170
Wangquan Hongye's

302
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,020
old injury has relapsed.

303
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,670
He's much weaker now.

304
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,360
It's a good time

305
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,630
to take him down now.

306
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,300
What's the hurry?

307
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,780
I will do it

308
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,510
when I should.

309
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,020
And when do you think that is?

310
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,310
Are you interrogating me?

311
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,500
No, no, no.

312
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,440
I'll be investigated

313
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,930
for Rushan's escape sooner or later.

314
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Why don’t you

315
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,170
just kill Wangquan Hongye

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,870
and settle it once and for all?

317
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,349
Once Hongye's dead,

318
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,160
you can go with the flow

319
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,560
and become the director.

320
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,270
It'll be settled once and for all indeed.

321
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,349
But I wonder

322
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,630
what else you can do for Spirit Lord.

323
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,050
What do you want?

324
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,280
In the Yiqi Alliance tryouts,

325
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,450
you lost to Yuechu

326
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,880
and disgraced the Nangong family.

327
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,580
You hated your father for scolding you,

328
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,380
so you asked me to kill him.

329
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,300
Sir, you instigated me.

330
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,630
I instigated you?

331
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,410
If you hadn't wanted to kill your father,

332
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,450
what's the use of bewitching you?

333
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,430
Now you even dare to pry into Spirit Lord's plan.

334
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,190
In the end,

335
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,180
humans are just despicable.

336
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,200
You...

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,600
Chief.

338
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,150
Nangong Shi colluded with evil spirits

339
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,340
and betrayed Yiqi Alliance.

340
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,860
He has to be punished.

341
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,850
Can you hand him over to Yiqi Alliance?

342
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,510
Nangong Shi

343
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,070
colluded with evil spirits,

344
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,160
killed his father,

345
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,350
and broke into Huntian Prison.

346
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,010
Do you still

347
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,830
want to serve him?

348
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,790
Long time no see,

349
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,790
Yaya.

350
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,320
Guoguo?

351
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,640
It's you?

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,290
Tell me.

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,920
Where's Shi Ji?

354
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,600
Who's the spy in Tushan?

355
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
Spy?

356
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,980
It could be anyone in Tushan.

357
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,830
If you dare,

358
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,340
kill all the spirits in Tushan!

359
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:54,940
Shut up!

360
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,060
Why are you still so stubborn

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
and insist on

362
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,310
going against Spirit Alliance?

363
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,720
You always talk about Tushan and Spirit Alliance.

364
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,900
Have you ever

365
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,180
thought of the many lone spirits out there

366
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,070
being bullied

367
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,200
and toyed by humans?

368
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,160
Since you hate humans so much,

369
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,810
why are you allying with Nangong Shi?

370
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,000
If I can use him to take down Tushan,

371
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,690
then destroy the human race with Tushan's power,

372
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,530
what's the big deal of tolerating him for now?

373
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,420
Jerk!

374
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,080
Have you ever thought

375
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,430
that the humans and foxes you killed

376
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,640
are also precious lives

377
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,520
with siblings

378
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,030
and people they love?

379
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,290
What do their lives have to do with me?

380
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,470
Whoever gets in my way

381
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,810
will have to die.

382
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,570
Guoguo.

383
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,550
If...

384
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,540
you knew this day would come,

385
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,490
would you still have saved me?

386
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,330
Yes.

387
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,240
No.

388
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,680
Next time...

389
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,810
don't save me.

390
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,960
With my protection,

391
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,010
you can live happily in the future.

392
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,890
In this life,

393
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,330
you've made many mistakes.

394
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,140
I hope these scars disappear.

395
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,490
You're still

396
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,860
the lovely

397
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,990
little white fox.

398
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,230
He had a chance to turn back.

399
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,130
Enjoy.

400
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,280
Thank you.

401
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,200
We scoured around for so long last night

402
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
but found no trace of Constable Lyu.

403
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,890
What should we do now?

404
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,060
Nangong Shi's been arrested.

405
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,920
Let's go to the trial after eating.

406
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,520
Maybe we'll find something.

407
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,960
The imitated Claw of Insulation?

408
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,640
Him again?

409
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,260
A letter from someone over there.

410
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,300
I have Lyu Jianwen.

411
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,910
[Dongfang Luo]

412
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,550
See you at Setting Moon River at noon today.

413
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,880
Every two hours that you're late,

414
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll kill one.

415
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,270
Darn it.

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Fine.

417
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,580
I'll get rid of you this time

418
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,260
so you can't keep deceiving Honghong

419
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,620
and harming the innocent.

420
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,540
You can't go.

421
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,560
This is obviously a trap set by Dongfang Luo

422
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,400
to harm you.

423
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,770
If I don't go,

424
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,200
there will be a next time.

425
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,480
But it's too dangerous.

426
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,070
I won't give him the chance.

427
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,750
I'll go with you.

428
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,310
Don't worry about me.

429
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Wait for me at Divine Flame Villa.

430
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,920
But...

431
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,540
I...

432
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,620
For Tushan Honghong,

433
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,720
can you really sacrifice your life?

434
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,670
Luo's nowhere to be found

435
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,310
in the entire Tushan.

436
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,640
He must've taken action.

437
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:14,920
Chief.

438
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,200
Luo's no longer in Twin Peaks.

439
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,750
He...

440
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,420
Guoguo's passed away.

441
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,780
Apart from Shi Ji,

442
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,950
only Nangong Shi knows the whereabouts of

443
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,180
Jianwen and Rushan.

444
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,070
At Wangquan Villa,

445
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,400
you must make him speak.

446
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,690
Don't worry.

447
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,740
I have many ways to make him speak.

448
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,720
It's news from Tushan.

449
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,340
What happened?

450
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,670
Luo secretly left Tushan.

451
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,510
You clearly warned him

452
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,170
not to leave Tushan

453
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,310
as the evil spirits have been rampant.

454
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,910
Honghong.

455
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,970
I know you trust Dongfang Luo.

456
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,370
But under scrutiny,

457
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,610
something's off with his awakening.

458
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,480
Don't you suspect it?

459
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,670
When did this happen?

460
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,760
Did Lai follow him?

461
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,690
Lai didn't finish his words.

462
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,710
Tushan must be in trouble.

463
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,990
Go back now.

464
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,650
What about you?

465
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,900
I'll go to Luo.

466
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,950
If he's plotting something,

467
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,740
he must be related to Jianwen's disappearance.

468
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,270
But where in the vast world outside Tushan

469
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,530
will you go to find him?

470
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,050
Setting Moon River.

471
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,350
Nangong Shi mentioned it last night.

472
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,210
Shi Ji plans to cause chaos there.

473
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,110
Honghong.

474
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,210
Don't be too worried.

475
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,270
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

476
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,350
[Setting Moon River]

477
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,550
Why are you here?

478
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,730
Surprised?

479
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,210
It seems the spy you planted in Tushan

480
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,400
is a good liar.

481
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,160
Not only did he deceive Honghong

482
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,510
but also you.

483
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,890
He deserves to die.

484
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,160
You won't live too.

485
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,830
Honghong.

486
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,400
This is my last time lying to you.

487
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,350
After Shi Ji and Yuechu die,

488
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,470
no one can stop us from being together.

489
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,920
How are you?

490
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,240
This Dark Force isn't strong.

491
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,080
How did you get hurt by it?

492
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,960
I'm fine.

493
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,580
He's actually become so powerful.

494
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,400
I still need to deal with Honghong.

495
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,840
I've to stop this fight.

496
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,280
Yuechu, you're lucky this time.

497
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,810
It won't be so easy next time.

498
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,370
Yuechu.

499
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
After centuries, to think there'd still be

500
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,900
an outstanding Dongfang descendant.

501
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,780
If you didn't

502
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,790
keep coming between me and Honghong

503
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,010
and discover my identity,

504
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,670
I'd really want to let you off.

505
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,530
Cut the crap.

506
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,730
What a pity.

507
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,300
I'd really miss you, buddy.

508
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,830
Don't you know the Claw of Insulation?

509
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,960
Why don't you use it?

510
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,850
Or are you afraid Honghong will realize

511
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,810
you killed Chi Shan and framed her?

512
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,680
Don't you feel guilty to Honghong?

513
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,400
The Dongfang Luo whom she's been waiting for

514
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
is kind and sincere, would risk his life for justice

515
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,960
and go against his entire sect.

516
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,780
Are you him?

517
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,270
You're asking for it.

518
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,780
You saw everything?

519
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,850
Where did you learn

520
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,740
such a similar Claw of Insulation?

521
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,200
Honghong, let me explain.

522
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,130
Explain what?

523
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,020
Explain how you

524
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,680
awakened with the Dark Force?

525
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,960
Or how you killed Chi Shan and framed Honghong,

526
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,220
then used the antidote

527
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,920
to lure Honghong to Fire Dragon Valley

528
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,400
and almost had her killed?

529
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,270
Don't!

530
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,970
Why are you stopping me?

531
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,150
Do you really like him that much?

532
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,360
So much that you can ignore right from wrong,

533
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,160
that you can protect him even after finding out

534
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,090
he aided the tyrant to deceive you?

535
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,000
Fine.

536
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,140
Luo is right.

537
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,140
It's my fault

538
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,720
for being nosy.

539
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,770
You're injured.

540
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,200
I'll take you back to Tushan to heal you.

541
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,720
No need.

542
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,260
At this point,

543
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,560
you should worry about Luo.

544
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,080
I can’t trouble you, Chief.

545
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,550
This aura...

546
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,580
Lyu Jianwen!

547
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,680
You fool.

548
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,830
You know jailbreaking is a capital crime.

549
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,180
Why did you come to save me?

550
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,580
I...

551
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,260
Why are you so cold?

552
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,550
It's the Cold Magic.

553
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,990
In less than a day,

554
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,550
♫The falling leaves♫

555
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,400
you'll be frozen

556
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,680
inside out.

557
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,600
♫Land on autumn grass♫

558
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,850
♫Who knocked on my heart again♫

559
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,560
♫I look back a thousand times♫

560
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:00,600
♫At the most unbearable sincerity♫

561
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,110
I grew up in the land of flames.

562
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,720
♫Waiting for you to ask♫

563
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,190
My blood can suppress the cold.

564
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,760
♫Let the warmth linger even for a moment♫

565
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,670
Hang in there.

566
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,580
You'll be warm soon.

567
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,190
♫My yearning descends from the sky♫

568
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,400
♫Turning into countless whispers♫

569
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,330
♫I wipe away your tears with a piece of night sky♫

570
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,210
♫The past is always the same♫

571
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,740
♫I've heard of the jokes in the streets♫

572
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,840
Yan Rushan!

573
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,150
♫How deep can this love carve into the wood♫

574
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,390
Why are you so foolish?

575
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,200
You know

576
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,760
they want you to exhaust your power

577
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,840
to save me.

578
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,400
♫The red leaves set us ablaze♫

579
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,120
Why did you still do it?

580
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,670
♫The snow drains our warmth♫

581
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,420
I'm sorry.

582
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,570
I promised you

583
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,880
♫We keep parting and loving each other again♫

584
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,940
I wouldn't escape prison.

585
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,880
♫Living life like a dream♫

586
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,530
But I broke my promise.

587
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,650
♫My heart and mind are always conflicting♫

588
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,770
Send me back

589
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,480
♫I have passed by so many people♫

590
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,070
to Huntian Prison.

591
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,550
No matter what the consequence is...

592
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,290
♫All that is left♫

593
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,410
♫Is my reflection in your eyes♫

594
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,690
No.

595
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,230
There must be other ways.

596
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,720
I'll take you back to Tushan for treatment.

597
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Even Yiqi Alliance's law can't stop it.

598
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,350
[Divine Flame Villa]

599
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,310
How cruel.

600
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,810
Although she feels guilty towards him,

601
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,120
Tushan's raised him for 400 years.

602
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,880
Now that he's awake, she doesn't owe him anything.

603
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,040
Why's she still so protective of him

604
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,640
after finding out he's evil?

605
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,550
I saw these flowers blooming in the yard.

606
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,440
I thought you might like it,

607
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,700
so I got one branch.

608
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,530
Why are you here?

609
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,820
Do you still hate me for

610
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,430
exposing Luo's lies

611
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,650
and ruining your beautiful future together?

612
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,560
I came to see you.

613
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,340
It's my fault.

614
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,050
I got you hurt this time.

615
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Actually,

616
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,540
it's not entirely your fault.

617
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,120
He intentionally deceived you.

618
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:31,730
It's understandable

619
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,250
you were confused.

620
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,670
Actually,

621
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,550
he became like this

622
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,210
because of me.

623
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,960
Watch those two foxes.

624
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,679
Yes.

625
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,760
He is

626
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,570
innately kind.

627
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,450
If I hadn't misunderstood him,

628
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,930
he wouldn't have been in a coma for so long

629
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,500
and be used by Shi Ji.

630
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,290
Humans and spirits

631
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,370
were at war.

632
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,730
It's natural that you didn't trust him.

633
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,000
Besides,

634
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
you're no longer the old you.

635
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,670
Tushan owes no favors.

636
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,310
You got hurt because of me.

637
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,350
I must make it up to you.

638
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,970
I can grant you a wish

639
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
within my means.

640
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,480
Wish?

641
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
If you can't think of one now,

642
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,730
don't rush it.

643
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,200
This is my wish.

644
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,880
Chief, please comply.

645
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,740
Are you going back on your word?

646
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,860
Don't tell anyone.

647
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,040
I promise.

648
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,050
Your injury...

649
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,480
I'm fine.

650
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,920
Actually, you're not to blame for Luo.

651
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,820
Don’t blame yourself.

652
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,780
Greetings, Master,

653
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,490
Chief of Tushan.

654
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,370
What is it?

655
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,870
Wangquan Villa sent news

656
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,550
for all sects to gather tomorrow

657
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,680
to discuss Nangong Shi's punishment.

658
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,960
Nangong Shi colluded with evil spirits.

659
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,630
I'm afraid

660
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,670
Yiqi Alliance can’t handle it.

661
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Wangquan Hongye's invited me to the trial.

662
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,070
He did?

663
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,050
Has he fixed his bad temper?

664
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
They've probably realized

665
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,580
Nangong Shi

666
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,950
isn't colluding with some ordinary spirit

667
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,550
but another powerful force.

668
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,710
Another force?

669
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,740
Outside the circular boundary.
