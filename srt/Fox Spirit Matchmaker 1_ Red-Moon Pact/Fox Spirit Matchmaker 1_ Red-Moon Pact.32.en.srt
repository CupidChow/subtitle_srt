Yaya.

6
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,650
I've checked everywhere.

7
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,710
Nothing unusual.

8
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,870
I wish I'd never get injured again.

9
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,070
Chief wouldn't let me go to Nanlin with her,

10
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,930
and you wouldn't let me go on patrol with you either.

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,150
Just concentrate on getting better.

The safety of the six realms

Why are you writing this all of a sudden?

20
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,990
It's an appeal.

Then hit me again.

I can't bring myself to do it.

In the past,

But after I met you,

I learned how it felt

44

Shut up.

Who gave you permission to come over here?

132
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,230
You agreed

133
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,430

Deputy Chief, let go of me.

135
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,600
Yes, Deputy Chief.

136

We can talk.

137
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,690
Fine.

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,010
I can let go,

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
but you need to tell me

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,530
how I should punish you today.

141
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,150
Wh-What should we do?

142
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,210
How about giving each of you ten slaps on the palm?

143
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,480
No, Deputy Chief.

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,430
No, Deputy Chief.

145
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,010
No! No!

146
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,950
There is another solution.

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,430
You can stay here and keep watching the show,

148
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,800
but you can't argue about being different again.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,790
Not just today,

150
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,890
you can't be hostile towards each other anymore.

151
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,470
Cut the crap.

152
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,790
Forget the show.

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,020
Take all of them back.

154
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:32,720
Okay.

155
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,549
No, no, no.

156
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,880
We won't be hostile to each other anymore.

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,669
That's your own choice, right?

158
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,150
Yes.

159
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,990
Then, from now on,

160
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,480
if I catch anyone

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,800
starting trouble over human-spirit differences again,

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
they'll have me to answer to.

163
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,320
Alright. Enjoy the show.

164
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,840
Let's watch the show.

165
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,400
Deputy Chief, they made up.

166
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,890
You're awesome.

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,900
Of course.

168
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,120
I told you

169
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,190
there's nothing I can't do.

170
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,710
Stupid girl.

171
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,580
Can't she just give me a break?

172
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,080
Proposing marriage?

173
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,010
Where did she meet him?

174
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,210
She's out of her mind!

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,850
Chun, it's clear in this letter

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,750
that the boy's name is Weisheng,

177
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,010
and they've known each other for a while.

178
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah.

179
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,310
It's too soon to propose marriage.

180
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
But since the boy is coming for a visit for the first time,

181
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,040
as Xia's mother, you should take it seriously.

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,210
Like hell I will!

183
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,520
Why weren't you so forward back then?

184
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
We had known each other forever.

185
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,270
Why didn't you come to my house and propose marriage?

186
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,740
Chun, I was wrong.

187
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Do you mean it?

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Yes. I was wrong.

189
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Chun,

190
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,770
look,

191
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,090
both of us are old now.

192
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,720
Can we…

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,200
No way.

194
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,520
Between us,

195
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,310
nothing is gonna happen.

196
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,620
Chun.

197
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:04,970
Cut the crap.

198
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,790
I need to go train those tree spirits.

199
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,480
Before we find the Seven-Treasures Bark,

200
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,160
we must not let down our guard.

201
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,290
There's no rush.

202
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,860
The kids will be back soon.

203
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
As Xia's mother,

204
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
you can't be absent.

205
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
If I stayed,

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,900
I'd be indulging their whims.

207
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,510
Go away!

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,220
Chun.

209
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,870
Well…

210
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,140
We'll wait for you for dinner!

211
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,430
Like I care!

212
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,630
We'll wait for you.

213
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,460
What…

214
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,800
What do you like?

215
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,100
I mean,

216
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,450
is there anything

217
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,360
you really want or like?

218
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,540
I like…

219
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
I like everything about you.

220
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,020
I know how you feel about me.

221
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,440
But if I'm going to propose marriage, I don't think

222
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,040
I should go with empty hands.

223
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,630
My family doesn't care about that.

224
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,080
Wait, wait.

225
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,540
My family only cares about

226
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
your character.

227
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,220
Let's go.

228
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,980
Wait, wait.

229
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,750
I still should prepare something.

230
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

231
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,750
Fool.

232
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,780
Where did you get so many eggs?

233
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,150
-You once mentioned that…
-Whatever. Let's go.

234
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,630
Wait, wait. Hold on.

235
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,010
You really want to marry me?

236
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,120
We just met.

237
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,780
-How about…
-What do you mean?

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,060
Don't get me wrong.

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,210
I know you're a good girl.

240
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,310
It's just that I'm poor,

241
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,720
timid, and incompetent.

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,320
Let's wait until…

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,840
I can't wait.

244
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
Or the guy…

245
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,550
The guy…

246
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,930
Actually,

247
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,000
guys who seem competent

248
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
but are actually arrogant and snobbish

249
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,570
are annoying in my eyes.

250
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,350
Really?

251
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,260
Yes. My mother once said

252
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,290
an able man

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,220
is a man who treats his woman well.

254
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,910
You treat me very well.

255
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,010
Let's go.

256
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,150
Come on.

257
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,080
Who are you?

258
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,160
Why are you in my house?

259
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,990
You're Xiaxia, right?

260
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,400
You look just like your mom.

261
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,240
What a disgusting and vulgar nickname.

262
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,000
How did you come up with it?

263
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,990
My mom

264
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,750
often talked about a guy called Jiaojiao

265
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,210
who was short-tempered and narrow-minded.

266
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,450
That's you, right?

267
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,480
That's what your mom said about me?

268
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Not only that.

269
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,920
She even angrily cursed your name in her dreams.

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,630
It seems that Chun really hates me.

271
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,390
Sir,

272
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,100
I think it's because her mother missed you

273
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,170
that she often mentioned you.

274
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,550
You have a point.

275
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
You're Weisheng,

276
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,030
the guy Xia mentioned in her letter, right?

277
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,890
You seem like a good guy.

278
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,880
Wow, you brought a gift.

279
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,000
Sorry.

280
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,750
It's not an expensive gift,

281
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,790
but I…

282
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,440
It's fine.

283
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,210
Give it to me. It's great.

284
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,550
It's a great gift.

285
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,670
Let me tell you.

286
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,430
In a romantic relationship,

287
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,170
what matters is feelings.

288
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,390
You should take care of each other.

289
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,220
Spoil her a little bit.

290
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,610
Don't let her feel wronged or get hurt.

291
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
But I can see

292
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,930
that you're a kind and honest boy.

293
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,680
No wonder she's chosen you.

294
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,830
Did you prepare all these dishes?

295
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,380
Yeah…

296
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,090
No, no.

297
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,920
Your mom prepared them.

298
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,990
How's that possible?

299
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,400
She wouldn't even wait for me,

300
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
let alone prepare food for me.

301
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,910
Besides, she can't cook at all.

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,300
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

303
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,350
Since you're my mom's old lover,

304
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,950
I'll respect you as an elder.

305
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,020
Today,

306
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,000
you'll make the decision

307
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,770
for me and Weisheng.

308
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:06,550
Sir.

309
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,540
My name is Hu Weisheng.

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm here today

311
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,240
to propose marriage to Ms. Xia.

312
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,130
For richer or for poorer,

313
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,960
for better or for worse,

314
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,370
I'll always be by her side

315
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,490
and protect her.

316
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,630
Great.

317
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,120
Great.

318
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,570
Xia.

319
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,900
If your mom hadn't left in a hurry to train those tree spirits,

320
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,410
she would agree too.

321
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,960
Tree spirits?

322
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,480
You're a spirit?

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,940
I…

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
Blood for blood!

325
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Tree spirits killed people from the Ximen family.

326
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,240
I'll make you pay today.

327
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,490
Eldest Senior?

328
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,330
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

329
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,270
Xia.

330
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,190
I'll take care of them.

331
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,930
Go get your mom with Weisheng.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,090
All three of you

333
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,610
have to die today.

334
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,710
Don't think about escaping!

335
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,670
Let's go!

336
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,490
A bunch of losers. You're dead.

337
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,210
The female robber?

338
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
It's really her.

339
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,040
Weisheng.

340
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,510
Xia, leave!

341
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,170
I'm just playing nice.

342
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,800
Don't take a fox for a kitten.

343
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,310
Come with me!

344
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,130
Be careful.

345
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,970
Gently.

346
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
It's strange.

347
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,660
How come those disciples were killed by tree spirits?

348
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,390
Is there another conflict between the two clans?

349
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,590
If so,

350
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,250
Chief Yueti should've informed us of it.

351
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,730
Now,

352
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
we need to find out Ximen Li's secret first.

353
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,210
Everything else can wait.

354
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,760
Tree spirits can go to hell.

355
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,690
They're so cruel.

356
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,370
Yeah.

357
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,900
Director Dongfang,

358
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,940
you've seen it.

359
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,010
Yueti Chun took revenge on me out of hate.

360
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,380
I only took three drops of blood from her,

361
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,080
yet she took six lives from the Ximen family.

362
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,070
How should I

363
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,800
settle this score with her?

364
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,980
It depends on you, Patriarch Ximen.

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,790
However,

366
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,910
aren't you going to meet me now?

367
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,700
Black Foxes.

368
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,150
Yuechu.

369
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,430
It's you.

370
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
Dongfang,

371
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,560
we meet again.

372
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,200
He's just a dead man.

373
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,240
Sometimes the truth

374
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,150
is not what you see.

375
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,240
If you want the truth,

376
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,140
come with me.

377
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,860
Yuechu.

378
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,750
Black Foxes took their primordial cores.

379
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,830
It's all Shi Ji's scheme.

380
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,090
She's killed Ximen Li.

381
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,300
As for Ximen Gong,

382
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
he's probably already controlled by the Dark Force.

383
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
I'll go after Shi Ji. Ximen Gong is at Nanlin.

384
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,290
Okay. I'll go to Nanlin.

385
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Where do you live?

386
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240
We need to tell your mom to save the old fox.

387
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
We caused such a ruckus.

388
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
She must've noticed it and is on her way back.

389
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,350
That old fox is an elder from Tushan.

390
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,410
Those Ximen scumbags can't hurt him.

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,480
What should we do now?

392
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,280
Keep running.

393
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,260
Okay.

394
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,610
Tushan Honghong.

395
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,270
The person you're after

396
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,840
is not here.

397
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,720
Humans

398
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,880
are the least reliable.

399
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,480
Do you think only you guys can use the fox spell?

400
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,110
Let me see how many more schemes you're hatching

401
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,590
through your vision.

402
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,770
Making the Tear of Void

403
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,930
will cost the cultivator all their vitality.

404
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,360
With the blood of a fox spirit,

405
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,750
the Black Fox can possess the fox spirit forever.

406
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,520
Fox spirit.

407
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,930
Three drops of Elder's blood?

408
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,290
Tushan Honghong.

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,520
You can never catch Black Foxes.

410
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,490
Oh, no.

411
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,030
Elder.

412
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
From the very beginning,

413
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,250
Tushan shouldn't have gotten involved in the mess at Nanlin.

414
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,610
Forget about Tushan and Nanlin.

415
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,400
It's all for the Spirit Alliance.

416
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,070
Take my advice.

417
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,450
Know your place and surrender now.

418
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,540
Don't force me to kill you.

419
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,560
Old fox,

420
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,750
you haven't seen war in hundreds of years

421
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,750
but are still such a good fighter.

422
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,130
You shouldn't have

423
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,740
chosen to side with Tushan Honghong back then.

424
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,880
Don't blame me for not showing you mercy.

425
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,030
Old fox!

426
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,910
Stop!

427
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,580
That spirit power…

428
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,640
It's the Black Fox.

429
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,510
Dongfang Yuechu,

430
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,360
watch carefully.

431
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,430
All the disciples of the Yiqi Alliance here

432
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,800
will die in front of you one by one today!

433
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,830
You're not Elder.

434
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,370
I took three drops of his blood

435
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,830
because we're both fox spirits

436
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,660
and I can use the blood to let the Black Fox possess him.

437
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,340
Only after he dies

438
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,860
can he be freed from the Black Fox.

439
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,480
Do you

440
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,030
have the guts to kill me?

441
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Director.

442
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,240
Elder!

443
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,780
Elder!

444
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,830
Wake up!

445
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,310
Yuechu.

446
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,910
I can't hold on.

447
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,680
Dongfang Yuechu.

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Between Tushan and the Yiqi Alliance,

449
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,240
which one will you choose?

450
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,000
Kill me.

451
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,920
Hate all you want. The more you hate me, the stronger I become.

452
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,970
Kill me!

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Or the Black Fox won't give up!

454
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,860
Elder!

455
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,650
Yes. Kill all the humans in the six realms!

456
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,900
-Director!
-Director!

457
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,090
Director, help me.

458
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,370
It's useless.

459
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,610
Dongfang Yuechu,

460
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,890
you won't kill me.

461
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,610
Just watch me kill everyone!

462
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,390
Yuechu, kill me now!

463
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,350
I have to die to be freed from the Black Fox's control.

464
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,750
If one day I commit sins against Tushan,

465
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,030
you must kill me.

466
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
Can you promise me?

467
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,590
No.

468
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,200
Can you promise me?

469
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,630
No.

470
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,330
Just promise me, will you?

471
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,370
Fine, fine. I promise you.

472
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,060
You annoying fox.

473
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,590
Good.

474
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,680
What a nice

475
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,000
stab!

476
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,630
Elder.

477
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,890
Sorry.

478
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,070
Elder.

479
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,960
Good boy.

480
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,710
Thank you.

481
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,960
Tushan didn't raise you for nothing.

482
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,320
Elder.

483
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,920
Elder.

484
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,140
You can't die.

485
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,340
You can't…

486
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,020
From now on,

487
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,530
Chief

488
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,350
and Tushan

489
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,380
will…

490
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,270
will be…

491
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,670
counting on…

492
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,480
you.

493
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,910
Elder!

494
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,830
I won't let you die.

495
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,600
I won't let you die.

496
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:31,800
Elder.

497
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,570
Elder.

498
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,720
Tushan Honghong,

499
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
this is just the beginning.

500
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,010
All those you want to protect

501
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,350
will die one by one.

502
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,890
Why?

503
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,130
Was there no other way?

504
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,290
Why?

505
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,710
Was there no other way?

506
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,150
Why?

507
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,050
Was there no other way?

508
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,350
Why?

509
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,070
Was there no other way?

510
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,950
Everyone, rest assured.

511
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:14,550
The Yiqi Alliance will send people to protect you soon.

512
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,300
The Ximen family will be fine.

513
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,240
Director,

514
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,290
my master was killed by an evil spirit.

515
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,450
Should we ask the Spirit Alliance

516
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,580
for an explanation?

517
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes.

518
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,040
And our fellow disciples who died at Nanlin,

519
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,110
and those…

520
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,290
Tushan Buzui

521
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,010
is dead.

522
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,640
Well...

523
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,110
So what?

524
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,400
He killed so many of our fellow disciples.

525
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,660
We can't just let it go!

526
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,960
We must demand an explanation from Tushan!

527
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes.

528
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,550
We need an explanation.

529
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,160
Report!

530
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,350
Bad news!

531
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,720
We're surrounded by tree spirits.

532
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,590
Good.

533
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
You're all here.

534
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,920
It's you guys,

535
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,110
the Ximen family

536
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,810
and the Yiqi Alliance…

537
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,820
You all played a part

538
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,880
in the old fox's death!

539
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,880
Even if you didn't steal the Seven-Treasures Bark,

540
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,310
the three drops of blood you took already settled our feuds.

541
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,980
That day,

542
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,140
why did you go to Nanlin to pick fights again?

543
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,440
Chief Yueti,

544
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,400
this matter...

545
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,070
Shut up!

546
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I thought you were a good man.

547
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
But it turns out that you're a treacherous guy who can't tell right from wrong

548
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,300
and favors the Yiqi Alliance.

549
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,710
If it weren't for you,

550
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,770
Buzui wouldn't have died.

551
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,530
I, Yueti Chun,

552
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,240
swear to God

553
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,960
that we tree spirits

554
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,930
won't let you trifle with us again.

555
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:14,070
If the disciples of the Yiqi Alliance

556
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,570
dare to come to Nanlin again,

557
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,590
I'll kill

558
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,240
every single one of them!

559
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,590
Chief Yueti.

560
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,760
This is not what the old fox would want to see.

561
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,960
Everyone, I know your pain and hatred

562
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,580
better than anyone.

563
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,500
But in the end, this tragedy happened

564
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,810
because the evil spirit, Shi Ji, colluded with Black Foxes

565
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,480
to sow discord among us.

566
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,280
If the Ximen family and Nanlin

567
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,440
turn against each other because of this,

568
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
they'll get exactly what they want.

569
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,670
Guys, trust me.

570
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,199
I'll find out the truth

571
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,760
and seek justice

572
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,530
for the dead.

573
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,310
Honghong, with me around,

574
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,880
you just need to try to be a good chief.

575
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,090
Now that Shi Ji's soul has been shattered,

576
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,670
she won't come back again.

577
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,390
Tushan will only get better and better.

578
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,960
Chief.

579
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,390
Everything is ready.

580
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,280
It's time…

581
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,520
to send Buzui back to Tushan.

582
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,920
When I was with him,

583
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,360
all he cared about was Tushan.

584
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,420
The place where he'd want to rest in peace

585
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,440
must be Tushan too.

586
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,140
Let's go.

587
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,850
♫Staring into the moonlit sky♫

588
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,980
♫Memories whisper softly in my ears♫

589
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,460
♫Borrowing a shimmer of light♫

590
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
♫To illuminate you♫

591
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,240
♫A thousand years feel like a fleeting moment♫

592
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,080
♫This isn't our first time around♫

593
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,720
♫Despite all the hardships♫

594
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,960
♫The warmth of love still remains♫

595
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,100
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

596
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,200
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

597
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,240
♫If you look back♫

598
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,600
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

599
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,520
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

600
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,950
♫To bury my entire life♫

601
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:44,210
♫Looking back, how can I make it worth it?♫

602
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,350
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

603
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,350
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

604
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,910
You swore never to set foot in Tushan.

605
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,680
It's his last ride home.

606
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,150
♫If you look back♫

607
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,870
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

608
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,710
Bid him farewell here.

609
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,430
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

610
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,720
♫To bury my entire life♫

611
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:28,240
♫When I look back, you're under the tree of longing♫

612
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,060
Sorry.
