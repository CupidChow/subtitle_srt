Spirit Lord.

6
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,530
Can you free us from our Mother Talismans?

7
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,000
Sure.

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,450
Come here.

9
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,280
Go.

10
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,280
Run!

11
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,920
Tushan Honghong.

12
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,390
It's your fault that these spirits were killed by humans.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Lai looked into it

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
and circled the names of those he found suspicious.

15
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,890
Further investigation is needed.

16
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,900
Thank you, Chief.

17
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,700
Without Tushan's help,

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,870
the truth about my father's poisoning

19
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,840
could never be revealed.

20
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,110
You're welcome, Your Highness.

21
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,840
Gujin is the head of spirit slaves.

22
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,650
He's close to Spirit Lord.

23
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,670
Yuechu has been following him secretly.

24
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,950
If everything goes well,

25
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,300
we'll soon find Spirit Lord's hideout.

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,030
That's great.

27
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,610
Your Highness,

28
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,150
I heard that Shi Kuan

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,310
is the most powerful spirit in the city.

30
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,110
Can you ask him to join the fight?

31
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,750
Of course.

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,750
But…

33
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,230
Has Shi Kuan lost his Mother Talisman too?

34
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,840
Humans are mean and cruel.

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,120
Without Mother Talismans,

36
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,750
they use magic tools to kill and threaten us.

37
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,210
They want to force us into submission

38
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,530
and enslave us again.

39
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,370
Enslaving us again

40
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,550
is no different from killing us!

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,890
We'd rather die than be slaves again!

42
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,710
Yes, we'd rather die than be slaves!

43
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,870
The Spirit-Master Kingdom has only 20,000 humans

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,400
but 100,000 spirits.

45
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,240
As long as you join forces with more of your kind

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,290
to fight back,

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,050
before long,

00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,710

Take the Spirit-Master Kingdom!

00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,570
Are you feeling unwell?

55
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,060
I'm fine.

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,630
It's the Spirit-Master Kingdom after all.

57
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,560
Spirits are not well treated here.

58
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,170
Yeah.

59
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,630
Its name alone, the Spirit-Master Kingdom,

60
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,110
makes me sick.

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,830
I have to help Honghong,

62
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,850
or I wouldn't have come to this dump.

63
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,800
Take a look.

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,520
Sir, this way.

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,120
On Life Island, there are indeed signs of a fox spirit's soul being restored.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,580
Whether it's Shi Ji or not,

67
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,810
I need more time to find it out.

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,290
A fox spirit?

69
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,860
Is it really Shi Ji?

70
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,390
Have you taken care of the spirit slave in the prison?

71
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,560
It's Elder Xu.

72
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,110
Spirit Lord,

73
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,520
recently,

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,480
Bu Tai seems to have noticed that the Mother Talismans were stolen

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,310
and has been secretly trying to find the mole.

76
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,630
I don't want to alert her,

77
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,070
so I haven't taken action yet.

78
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,220
Useless!

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,770
If Bu Tai is in your way,

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
just kill her.

81
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,230
I'm warning you.

82
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,000
If you fail me again,

83
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,670
you'll end up like those spirit slaves.

84
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,190
Yes.

85

You…

87
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,270
You've been lying to us.

88
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,130
I didn't lie.

89
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,960
I indeed want to build a world ruled by spirits.

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,210
You're just necessary sacrifices.

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,810
S-Sacrifices?

92
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,750
Oh, you've got a tail.

93
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,270
You're the female spirit who instigated spirits to rebel?

94
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,160
Who are you?

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,880
Why did you follow Gujin?

96
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,140
He's Dongfang Yuechu, the guy I've been looking for.

Tushan Honghong,

99
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,330
I didn't expect you

100
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,480
to prepare such a big gift for me.

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,200
Have you kept in mind

102
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,919
everything I said on the road?

103
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,120
Rest assured.

104
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,200
I'll keep Princess Bu Tai safe.

105
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,440
But Honghong,

106
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
can you assign Lai

107
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,030
another task?

108
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,270
I really don't want to work with him.

109
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,320
Why do you hate the Poison Boy of the Nan Kingdom so much?

110
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
I have good reason to hate him.

111
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
Think about it. Over the past hundreds of years,

112
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
the Nan Kingdom's poisons

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,190
have killed so many innocent humans and spirits.

114
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,970
Even many spirits with high cultivation

115
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,230
died from the strange poisons they made.

116
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,650
Although not all of them

117
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,430
were created by the Poison Boy,

118
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,500
he's still anything but good.

119
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,100
Have you ever seen him poison anyone with your own eyes?

120
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,920
No,

121
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,480
but it just shows how secretive he is.

122
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,710
What you said is just a rumor.

123
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,830
To understand someone, don't just listen to what others say.

124
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,490
Try to feel it with your heart.

125
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,270
Not to listen but to feel it with my heart?

126
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,960
So complicated.

127
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Don't think too much.

128
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Go.

129

Yuechu is in trouble.

132

The view here is great.

You like Aolai Sanshao, don't you?

134
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,170

You can't fool me.

140
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,340
This is a trap.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,500
Who knows what lethal poison from the Nan Kingdom is in it?

142
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,760
How could you say that?

143
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,190
Am I the kind of person who would poison you?

what you did to Honghong

147
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,680
to make her trust you so much.

148
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,720
She trusts me because everything I did,

149
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,750
I did for Tushan

150
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,670

the Nan Kingdom and the Spirit-Master Kingdom

154
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,020
have always been on bad terms.

155
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,190
One poisons people.

156
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,570

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,930
You must have come here

159

with an ulterior motive.

160
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,460
You're waiting for the Spirit-Master Kingdom to be thrown into chaos,

161
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,920
so you can benefit from it.

162

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,480
My spirit power now is not strong enough

191
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
to break it.

192
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,270
The effects of Half Spring Snow

193
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,200
can only last for an hour.

194
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,150
Although it can enhance your spirit power,

195
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,880
it'll also do harm to your body.

196
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,150
Don't take it unless it's a life-or-death situation.

197
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,150
Without her spirit bone, Tushan Honghong

198
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,550
can only enhance her cultivation by taking Half Spring Snow.

199
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,160
The effects of Half Spring Snow are fleeting.

200
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
We just need to stall her for an hour.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
Once it wears off,

202
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,300
I can shatter her soul myself.

203
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
At the matchmaking event back then,

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,670
Tushan Honghong narrowly escaped death in the nightmare

205
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,330
and set up the Seven Kills Formation to injure me.

206
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,490
Are you worried that I can't beat her?

207
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,360
I dare not.

208
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,380
Don't worry.

209
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,410
Even if she escaped me,

210
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,330
she'd definitely be badly injured.

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
She wouldn't be able to survive your Flame Formation.

212
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,040
Just keep one thing in mind:

213
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,500
don't activate the formation until she shows up

214
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,960
to save that Dongfang boy.

215
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,750
We'll wait in ambush

216
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,090
both in and out of the city.

217
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
It's a great strategy, Spirit Lord.

218
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,720
Go.

219
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,970
Yes.

220
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,550
Tushan Honghong.

221
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
This time,

222
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,150
I won't let you walk out alive.

223
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,870
An illusion formation?

224
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,290
Looks like they want to stall me.

225
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,290
After Half Spring Snow wears off,

226
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll be doomed.

227
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
Lady Fairy.

228
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,610
Where is Lady Fairy?

229
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,580
Is she trapped by you?

230
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,540
What if she is?

231
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Both you and she

232
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,220
have to die today.

233
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,820
You should worry about yourself.

234
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,100
Tushan Honghong.

235
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm surprised that you dare to come here

236
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,440
after losing your spirit bone.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,030
Today,

238
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,380
I'll make you wish

239
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,410
you were dead.

240
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
What if Shi Ji

241
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,670
can't badly hurt Tushan Honghong?

242
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,450
It's better to get the spiritual blood first.

243
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,880
From now on,

244
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,930
the Dongfang family will no longer exist in this world.

245
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,200
I, Jin Renfeng,

246
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,480
will be the only owner of Divine Flame Villa!

247
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Shi Ji.

248
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,480
It's really you.

249
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,400
No way.

250
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,450
Tushan Honghong

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,530
is still so powerful without her spirit bone.

252
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,900
Continuing this fight is too challenging for this body.

253
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,490
I have to count on Jin Renfeng.

254
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,000
How does Dongfang Blood taste?

255
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,710
What did you do?

256
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,210
I just spiced it up a bit.

257
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,690
How dare you poison me?

258
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,350
Where is the antidote?

259
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,080
Give it to me!

260
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Give me the Mother Talismans first.

261
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,940
Give me the antidote.

262
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,410
There is no antidote!

263
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,830
You despicable brat!

264
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,650
What I took was Fire Candle.

265
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,970
I don't like owing people favors.

266
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,260
You let me go last time.

267
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,350
This time, I gave this to you.

268
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,070
We are even now.

269
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,840
When one is poisoned with Fire Candle,

270
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,730
they just need to force the toxic blood out

271
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,990
and wait for fresh blood to be produced.

272
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,370
However, you used your power just now,

273
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,670
causing the Fire Candle

274
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,980
in the spiritual blood

275
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,780
to travel throughout your body.

276
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,200
Either you force the spiritual blood out of your body,

277
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,000
or

278
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,740
you have to endure the pain of being burned every day

279
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,990
and can never forget that

280
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,370
you stole the spiritual blood in your body!

281
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,260
Shut up!

282
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I'll kill you!

283
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,640
Lady Fairy.

284
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,380
I'll take you back.

285
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,270
How many Mother Talismans did you lose?

286
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,920
Almost half of them.

287
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,850
Forgive me, Spirit Lord.

288
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,350
If you hadn't activated the formation early to get the spiritual blood,

289
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,410
when Tushan Honghong entered the formation to save that boy,

290
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,970
she'd definitely have been trapped by it.

291
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,070
With you attacking her from the side,

292
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,070
she could in no way have escaped!

293
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,830
You deserve to die!

294
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,160
Spirit Lord.

295
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,750
Spirit Lord.

296
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,840
It's all that brat's fault.

297
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,920
I didn't expect him

298
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,060
to poison me.

299
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,480
Spirit Lord.

300
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm still very useful to you.

301
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,270
I can use the power of the Yiqi Alliance

302
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,830
to wipe them out.

303
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,030
My patience is wearing thin.

304
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,640
Don't let me down again.

305
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,500
Okay.

306
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Help me…

307
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,070
Help me go ahead for a rest.

308
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,350
Okay.

309
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,030
If I go into the city like this,

310
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,910
they'll be disconcerted.

311
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,780
Okay.

312
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,070
Lady Fairy.

313
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,270
Half Spring Snow takes a heavy toll on the user's body.

314
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,200
How could you harm yourself for me?

315
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,350
If I hadn't saved you,

316
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,650
you would've died there.

317
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,660
It was not only Jin Renfeng you were faced with this time,

318
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,350
but also Shi Ji who is hundreds of times stronger than him.

319
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,960
Thankfully, her cultivation hasn't fully recovered,

320
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,850
or even I

321
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,410
couldn't have saved you.

322
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,750
Yuechu,

323
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,010
Dongfang Luo's soul is still in your body.

324
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,510
Overusing your power

325
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,040
will cause it to fight back.

326
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:58,240
You're the most important now, Lady Fairy.

327
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,300
Stay undisturbed.

328
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,970
Focus on recuperation.

329
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,790
Lady Fairy,

330
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,370
to you,

331
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,830
I'm very important too,

332
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,640
right?

333
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,070
Her Highness

334
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,920
has dismissed you,

335
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,490
effective immediately.

336
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,120
You'll never be hired back.

337
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,070
Guard Shi,

338
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,350
please leave.

339
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,780
I promised

340
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,480
to protect Your Highness forever.

341
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,880
It was your duty

342
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,400
to protect me.

343
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,130
Now that you're not my spirit guard,

344
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,800
you don't have to keep that promise anymore.

345
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,200
It's not just about duty.

346
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,240
I…

347
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,870
I want to protect Your Highness.

348
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,650
Someone else will protect me in the future.

349
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,170
But that person

350
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,750
won't be you.

351
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,710
Kuan,

352
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,310
over all these years,

353
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,250
you've been devoted to protecting me.

354
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,580
Is it because I have your Mother Talisman?

355
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,610
No.

356
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,420
Whether you have it or not,

357
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,010
my loyalty to you

358
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,470
will never change.

359
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,070
Kuan,

360
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,470
the Spirit-Master Kingdom is in turmoil now.

361
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,750
No matter who will get

362
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,470
your Mother Talisman,

363
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,050
you should always put your safety first.

364
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,350
If you were coerced

365
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,900
into doing harm to me,

366
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,210
I wouldn't blame you.

367
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,170
No.

368
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,940
Don't you understand?

369
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,350
Now, without the talisman,

370
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,550
I don't trust you as much as I did before.

371
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,120
I said what I said just now

372
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,980
in order to

373
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,500
end things on good terms.

374
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,860
Your Highness…

375
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,880
Sorry, Kuan.

376
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,210
Your Mother Talisman is in the hands of bad guys now.

377
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,210
I have to force you to leave me now,

378
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
or you'll die.

379
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,960
Gujin.

380
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,670
You're home.

381
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,710
Spirit Lord

382
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,440
lied to us.

383
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,030
She found out that Her Highness

384
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,460
had known the Mother Talismans were taken.

385
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,560
Her Highness

386
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,200
is in danger.

387
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,700
Gujin.

388
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,680
Elder Xu,

389
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,850
why are you in my bedchamber at this late hour?

390
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,500
To kill you.

391
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,920
You're not Xu Yi.

392
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,810
Who are you?

393
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,600
You'll know later.

394
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,120
Bu Tai.

395
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,010
You'll die tonight!

396
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,570
Who are you? How dare you attack Her Highness?

397
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,880
Deputy Chief.

398
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,730
Deputy Chief.

399
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,360
It's the fox spell.

400
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:53,880
No.

401
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,630
It's not the fox spell.

402
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,830
It's indeed not the fox spell.

403
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,200
The fox spell doesn't have such powerful control

404
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,700
over people's minds.

405
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,970
You're finally awake.

406
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,300
Are you feeling better?

407
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,820
How…

408
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
After the recuperation,

409
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,650
you leaned on my shoulder and fell asleep.

410
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,310
You slept for the whole night.

411
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,550
How much power

412
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,590
did you consume

413
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,630
to strengthen my soul yesterday?

414
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,160
Just a little.

415
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,540
Compared to the risks you took to save me,

416
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,070
it's not worth mentioning.

417
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,980
Have you forced out the toxic blood in your body?

418
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,240
Yes.

419
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,240
I just lost a bit of blood. It's nothing.

420
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,830
Lady Fairy,

421
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,620
I know you were worried about me.

422
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,950
But I didn't risk my life

423
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,590
without getting anything in return.

424
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,090
Look.

425
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,960
I got these Mother Talismans back.

426
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,760
With them,

427
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,240
the spirits in the city

428
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,440
can't be threatened by Shi Ji anymore.

429
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,160
Unfortunately,

430
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,870
I only got half of them back.

431
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,080
Lady Fairy,

432
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,580
don't be angry with me.

433
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,360
Do you know

434
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,350
every time you throw yourself into danger,

435
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,880
those who care about you will be very worried?

436
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,930
I know I made you worry.

437
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,940
I promise

438
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,200
I'll be more careful next time.

439
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:42,890
I promise.

440
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,700
You must keep your word.

441
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,500
I will.

442
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,130
Does it still hurt?

443
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,600
No.

444
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,580
That's all for today.

445
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,790
Come back at this time tomorrow.

446
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,440
Master.

447
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,560
You used to take my blood every three days.

448
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,110
Today, why…

449
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,260
Are the injuries you've got this time

450
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,450
more severe than before?

451
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
Don't get smart.

452
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,160
If I find out

453
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,420
you make inquiries about me again,

454
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,440
I'll kill you.

455
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,800
I dare not.

456
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:57,920
Get lost!

457
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,670
Wait.

458
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,480
Go.

459
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,480
Get some spirit slaves back.

460
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,290
Yes.

461
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,639
Well,

462
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,480
why are you looking at me like that?

463
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,880
I just realized

464
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,360
you're actually quite good-looking.

465
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,600
Really?

466
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Actually, I always think

467
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,949
I'm a bit handsome.

468
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,989
And your move that night was so cool.

469
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,880
You sent that guy flying with one single blow.

470
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,050
I never knew

471
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,960
you could fight so well without using poison.

472
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,160
I just showed a teeny, tiny bit of my talent.

473
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,010
Lady Fairy.

474
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,920
Look.

475
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,940
There's a braggart here.

476
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,190
Brat. Honghong.

477
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Where did you go?

478
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,110
If it weren't for Lai,

479
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,640
I might never see you again.

480
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,780
Yuechu and I met Shi Ji.

481
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,190
Shi Ji?

482
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,330
That she-devil is so hard to get rid of.

483
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,100
It's been centuries,

484
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,650
yet she's come back again,

485
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,670
haunting both humans and spirits.

486
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,100
Chief,

487
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,880
have you found out who restored her soul

488
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,140
on Life Island for her?

489
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,720
Elder Buzui looked into it,

490
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,400
but the person who took away Shi Ji's soul fragments

491
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,660
left no traces behind.

492
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,700
Don't worry.

493
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
After we catch Shi Ji,

494
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,500
the truth will come to light.

495
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,910
Your Highness,

496
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,550
Guard Shi stayed outside all night last night.

497
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,690
Why are you still here?

498
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,460
Your Highness.

499
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,880
Gujin is dead.

500
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,200
That female spirit deceived him

501
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,670
and killed him.

502
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,850
Why are you telling me this?

503
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm afraid someone may hurt you.

504
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,000
Have you forgotten

505
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,680
you're not my spirit guard anymore?

506
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,380
You shouldn't appear in the imperial palace.

507
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,000
If you pester me again, I'll…

508
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,120
I'll leave now.

509
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,590
Your Highness.

510
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:01,880
Your Highness.

511
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,550
Chief.

512
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,710
Mr. Yuechu.

513
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,550
I heard that a few days ago,

514
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,620
someone tried to kill you,

515
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,150
and Shi Kuan protected you.

516
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,820
You dismissed him at this time

517
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,730
to protect him, right?

518
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,590
Kuan's Mother Talisman was stolen by evil spirits.

519
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,050
If he keeps protecting me,

520
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,710
he'll be threatened by those evil spirits.

521
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,440
I know he won't betray me.

522
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,730
But I can't just let him

523
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,280
die for me.

524
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,890
Don't worry, Your Highness.

525
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,660
On our trip,

526
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,840
we got back half of the Mother Talismans.

527
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,900
Maybe Kuan's talisman is one of them.

528
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,150
Then he'll be fine.

529
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,630
Kuan's Mother Talisman is not here.

530
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,410
I should've gone for broke

531
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,030
to get the rest of the talismans back.

532
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,770
Don't blame yourself, Mr. Yuechu.

533
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,920
I know you and Chief

534
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,920
took great risks

535
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,960
getting these talismans back.

536
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,410
How are you going to deal with them?

537
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,000
Chief.

538
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,090
I want to ask for a favor.

539
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,670
Chief, Mr. Yuechu, please help me

540
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,000
find a way

541
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,530
to balance humans' power and spirits' power.

542
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,400
I hope the Spirit-Master Kingdom

543
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,740
can stop using Mother Talismans

544
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,670
as leashes on spirits.

545
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,690
Count on me for this one.

546
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,000
That'll both free spirits from slavery

547
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,320
and give humans the power to protect themselves.

548
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,820
If we can succeed,

549
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,770
your country can achieve lasting peace.

550
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,840
Lady Fairy,

551
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
what do you think?

552
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,200
You...

553
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,640
It's you.

554
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,560
[Spirit-Master Kingdom]

555
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,530
Move! Move!

556
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,510
Move!

557
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,150
You, hurry up!

558
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,550
You guys, stop talking!

559
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,490
Keep moving!

560
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,280
Hurry!

561
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,220
I dare you to run again!

562
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,320
Mr. Xu Yi, your spirit slave is quite good-looking.

563
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,220
How about selling him to me?

564
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,360
Mr. Li,

565
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,860
I just bought this spirit slave.

566
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,120
I'm not done having fun with him.

567
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,840
No.

568
00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,840
No.

569
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,850
It's not real.

570
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,450
I must be dreaming.

571
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,690
I'm dreaming.

572
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:05,850
Dreaming?

573
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,190
Yes.

574
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,850
This place

575
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,050
was my nightmare.
