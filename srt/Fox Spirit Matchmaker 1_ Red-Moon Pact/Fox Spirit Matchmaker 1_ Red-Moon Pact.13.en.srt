5
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,390
Yaya.

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,229
Checked everything?

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,430
There's no suspicious spirit in the city.

8
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,960
I've confirmed it here too.

9
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,700
After Princess Bu Tai was killed,

10
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,160
no spirit's left the city.

11
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,039
Then who did it?

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,560
To assassinate Princess under Shi Kuan's nose,

13
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,130
they must be powerful.

14
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,360
This assassination's clearly

15
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,190
to provoke conflicts between humans

16
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,150
and spirits.

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,000
Right now,

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,730
we need to pacify the citizens.

19
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,430
The scheme can't succeed.

20
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,079
Lady Fairy.

21
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,120
So there's

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,940
still a trace of me in your heart.

23
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,470
You're awake?

24
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,300
Then why are you

25
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,170
still holding onto me?

26
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,400
Lady Fairy.

27
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,590
It's not my fault.

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,960
When I saw you sitting next to my bed,

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
I thought it was a dream.

30
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,280
I didn't want the dream to end,

31
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,580
so I didn't dare move.

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,660
Then why did you

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
move to grab my hand?

34
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,940
I said it was a dream.

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,160
In my dream, I can

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,560
do whatever I want.

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,800
Ouch!

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,720
Do you realize your mistake?

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,660
I was wrong.

40
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,530
Why did you lie to everyone and risk your life

41
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,910
to retrieve the stone?

42
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,610
If I didn't arrive in time,

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,480
what would...

44
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,079
What would happen to those waiting for you?

45
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,930
Sorry. I shouldn't have risked my life.

46
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,560
What else?

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
There's more?

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,300
You shouldn't sacrifice your life to protect his soul.

49
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,920
Humans have

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,240
short lifespans.

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,230
How can you simply give up decades of your life?

52
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,800
His soul was self-destructing.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,580
Only vitality can protect it.

54
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,340
I've to protect what you treasure

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,149
so you won't be sad.

56
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,779
You still should've told me.

57
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,510
Yes, I admit I went about it the wrong way.

58
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,070
But I was willing.

59
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,040
Be it taking risks or sacrificing my life,

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,860
if I can help you,

61
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,380
I can do anything.

62
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,070
Even if you don't help me,

63
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,290
I have my own ways.

64
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,330
Your ways?

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,159
Risk suffering the backlashes?

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
Protecting

67
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Tushan and spirits is my duty.

68
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,390
What methods I use

69
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,650
doesn't matter.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,510
It's your duty as Tushan's chief.

71
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,430
But you're still in a mortal body,

72
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,040
with blood, flesh, a heart, and feelings.

73
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,480
You'll get hurt

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,180
and fear the cold, heat, and loneliness.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,750
While you protect everyone,

76
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,950
who will protect you?

77
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,870
In this world,

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,210
someone should

79
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,650
protect you like you protect Tushan.

80
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,400
Right, you just woke up.

81
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,240
There's a thing you don't know.

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,520
Princess Bu Tai was assassinated.

83
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,010
Your Highness.

84
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,830
Why are you here?

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
I'll be

86
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,350
wherever you are.

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,940
If I didn't come,

88
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,820
you'd have died.

89
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,750
Kuan.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,160
That day, under Grief Tree...

91
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,330
I know.

92
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,230
I've always known.

93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,430
You said

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,010
you'd always be by my side.

95
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
But now,

96
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
where are you?

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,260
These memories

98
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,240
will remain

99
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,040
until I die,

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,580
right?

101
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,070
Grief Tree's flourishing

102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,070
and nourished by Honghong's power.

103
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,640
I thought

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,630
they'd stay together happily.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,690
Princess and I found out

106
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,720
a late emperor once fell in love with a spirit,

107
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,310
but they never got together.

108
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,390
Princess was braver than her ancestors.

109
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,120
Not only did she take this step,

110
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,090
but she also changed Spirit-Master Kingdom.

111
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,550
This is...

112
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,070
It's the magic tool they used while they got attached under Grief Tree.

113
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,680
It protects her fragmented soul.

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,090
Then the spirit power inside is...

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,040
It's Shi Kuan's.

116
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,430
It seems when Bu Tai made a wish,

117
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,400
Shi Kuan also vowed with his spirit power.

118
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,850
The divine edict sealed Bu Tai's soul

119
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,690
and her past with Shi Kuan.

120
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,240
When they meet again,

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,360
this memory will reappear.

122
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Grief Tree was nourished by love.

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,840
It must've sensed their deep love

124
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,820
that they went through fire and water for.

125
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,950
This is an endless fate.

126
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,360
With the divine edict's guidance,

127
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,210
it'll resume in the future.

128
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,060
It seems

129
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,780
humans and spirits can bond

130
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,630
with sincere and mutual love,

131
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,650
by vowing under Grief Tree

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,660
with a magic tool and spirit power

133
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,010
and saying "I do".

134
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Chief.

135
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,270
Do you remember

136
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,600
the wish Princess made under Grief Tree?

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,210
She wouldn't want to see you

138
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,720
sad and dispirited

139
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,100
and sink into an abyss.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,640
She loves you so much.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,030
Can you protect

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,330
her kingdom and people for her?

143
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,390
Me?

144
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,390
Who else can

145
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,980
protect Spirit-Master Kingdom for her?

146
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,260
Fortunately,

147
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,990
all the spirits in the city believe in you.

148
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,230
You will be the Beishan Emperor from now on.

149
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,810
I will protect her kingdom forever.

150
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
In that case,

151
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,720
I suggest

152
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,750
to first change the kingdom's name.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,660
Humans and spirits are equal;

154
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,190
neither should be

155
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,480
enslaved.

156
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Chief.

157
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,000
Can Bu Tai and I

158
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,830
meet in another form?

159
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,330
Since you've gotten attached,

160
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,290
Grief Tree must have its own plan.

161
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,720
Someone sent this to the city gate

162
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,950
and said it contains info,

163
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,350
that I must give it to you.

164
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,000
Bu Tai's death is just the beginning.

165
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,030
In the future, more humans

166
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,490
will be killed by spirits.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,910
It's Shi Ji.

168
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,780
I must

169
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,300
avenge the princess.

170
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,740
Lady Fairy.

171
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,250
The city's in chaos.

172
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,080
How dare you burn down our homes?

173
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,630
Exactly!

174
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,670
Why?

175
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,780
What's going on?

176
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,600
Shi Kuan!

177
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,270
Princess promised us

178
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,960
the humans wouldn't bully spirits anymore,

179
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,950
so we helped resist the evil spirits.

180
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,080
Now the humans

181
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,870
are burning down our homes secretly!

182
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,630
What's going on?

183
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,220
Under Yiqi Alliance's protection,

184
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,020
they even hurt several spirits!

185
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,890
Why did you burn down the spirits' homes?

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,330
They're bloodthirsty.

187
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,330
They killed our princess.

188
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,190
We must avenge Princess!

189
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,670
Avenge Princess!

190
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
Princess can't die in vain.

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:52,870
Yes!

192
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,240
We must kick these spirits

193
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,150
out of Spirit-Master Kingdom!

194
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,790
Get out of Spirit-Master Kingdom!

195
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,650
Princess Bu Tai

196
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,850
wasn't killed by spirits in the city.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
Just with your word,

198
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,390
you expect us to believe

199
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,700
they didn't kill her?

200
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,290
You're a spirit.

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,900
Of course you defend them.

202
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,060
Shi Kuan is the next emperor

203
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,940
appointed by Princess Bu Tai.

204
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,930
That day, Spirit Lord caused chaos

205
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
to assassinate Princess Bu Tai.

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Such infighting

207
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,980
is just what she wants.

208
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,360
They are spirits,

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,460
but they want peace

210
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
and hate killings

211
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,630
like you.

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,750
Your common enemy

213
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,600
is Spirit Lord, who desires to start a war.

214
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,120
Spirit Lord?

215
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,230
All right.

216
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,550
Dismiss.

217
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,230
From now on,

218
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,790
get along and don't fight.

219
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,840
Dismiss.

220
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,120
Go home.

221
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,090
Go on.

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,360
Chief.

223
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,030
Chief.

224
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,600
Get up.

225
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,380
Just tell her

226
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,740
what you want to.

227
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,000
Chief.

228
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,370
That day outside the city,

229
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,630
if you hadn't fought against Spirit Lord,

230
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,700
we'd have been dead

231
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,790
or controlled

232
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,140
by that evil spirit.

233
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,240
Today,

234
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,460
you cleared our name again.

235
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,240
We're indebted to you.

236
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,700
Please accept our bow.

237
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,390
Please accept our bow.

238
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
Honghong, you want to establish the Spirit Alliance?

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,030
Yes.

240
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,750
The city's humans are protected by Yiqi Alliance.

241
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,150
They also get magic tools

242
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,280
refined by Yuechu.

243
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,000
But the spirits will be

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
in a worse plight.

245
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,750
Yes.

246
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,960
Although they have spirit power,

247
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,510
once they really hurt humans,

248
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,960
they'll become evil spirits

249
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,420
and be at odds with humans.

250
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,000
If we can create

251
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,500
our own Spirit Alliance,

252
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,170
we can protect the weak

253
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
and restrain the strong.

254
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,630
For spirits,

255
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,810
it's a good thing.

256
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,590
Not only that,

257
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,290
Shi Ji's been sowing discord

258
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,890
between humans and spirits.

259
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,910
If the Spirit Alliance

260
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,510
can communicate with humans on behalf of spirits,

261
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,990
disputes can be resolved

262
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,630
and we can cooperate to fight enemies

263
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,040
when necessary.

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,510
Yes.

265
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
Shi Ji's still waiting to attack us.

266
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,150
If we don’t unite the spirits now,

267
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
more spirits slaves might become her pawns

268
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,480
to harm humans.

269
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
No more tragedies can occur.

270
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:12,960
Chief.

271
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,020
I'm willing to lead Beishan's spirits

272
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,280
to join the Spirit Alliance

273
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,610
and follow your orders.

274
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,760
Us leech spirits too.

275
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,930
Us Nan Kingdom too.

276
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,390
Honghong.

277
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,440
Can I join on behalf of Tushan?

278
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,010
The battle with Shi Ji's just the beginning.

279
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,740
In the future, with the Spirit Alliance,

280
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,400
more spirits will join forces

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,870
to resist her.

282
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,320
Besides,

283
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,600
we can make it more formal

284
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,000
and let all spirits in the six realms know

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,320
there is a Spirit Alliance

286
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,050
where the weak will be protected

287
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,700
and the strong can uphold justice,

288
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,760
helping each other

289
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,280
to protect the peace of the six realms.

290
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:03,000
[Beishan]

291
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
Spirit slavery in the city will now be abolished.

292
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,860
Humans and spirits are all Beishan's citizens.

293
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Congratulations, Spirit Emperor.

294
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,910
I'm ashamed.

295
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,550
The city's Yiqi Alliance disciples

296
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,740
were led by Xu Yi.

297
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,480
To think he's controlled by evil spirits.

298
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,550
In the future,

299
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,810
Wangquan Villa will discipline its disciples in the city.

300
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,150
Rest assured, Spirit Emperor.

301
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,790
I didn't expect the succession ceremony

302
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,000
to be so lively.

303
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,690
It's because there's another important matter in the city.

304
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,600
From now on, we spirits

305
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,250
will have our own Spirit Alliance.

306
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,160
Spirit Alliance?

307
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,400
Spirit Alliance?

308
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,030
For a long time,

309
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,310
there have been weak spirits being bullied,

310
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,700
spirits who act recklessly

311
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,150
to harm their comrades,

312
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,620
and human scum.

313
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,609
I hereby establish the Spirit Alliance

314
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,740
to protect the weak

315
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,190
and punish evil spirits.

316
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:12,910
Lady Fairy.

317
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,200
I'll help you accomplish

318
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,030
anything you want.

319
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,390
Beishan's willing to join the Spirit Alliance

320
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,720
and obey you, Director.

321
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,200
Nan Kingdom would also like to join

322
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,060
to bring peace to the spirit clan.

323
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,900
Leech spirits are willing to join

324
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,720
to punish and exterminate evil

325
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,250
to benefit the spirit clan.

326
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,240
Director.

327
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,200
Can lone spirits like me

328
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,400
join too?

329
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,890
If you obey the alliance's rules,

330
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,790
all spirits are welcome.

331
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,920
I'm willing to join.

332
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,210
I'm willing to join.

333
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,160
I'm willing to join.

334
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,270
We're all willing to join.

335
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,400
I'm willing to join.

336
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Ridiculous.

337
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm willing to join too.

338
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,920
Congratulations, Honghong.

339
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,320
Your spirit power's stronger than before.

340
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,990
Now the crisis of Beishan

341
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,920
is finally over.

342
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,640
Dongfang Luo's soul is fine too.

343
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,590
Elder also returned from Life Island.

344
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,160
You can finally

345
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,070
relax now.

346
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,200
Not yet.

347
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,800
Are you worried about Shi Ji's return?

348
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,920
Not just that.

349
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,080
She has

350
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,690
someone stronger backing her.

351
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,030
I think things

352
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,960
are different now.

353
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,830
Us three sisters were weak before,

354
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,610
but we could drive Shi Ji out of Tushan.

355
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,070
Now,

356
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,980
the strength of Tushan's increased.

357
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,250
You have Spirit Alliance members' support too.

358
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,520
I'm sure you can uphold justice

359
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,330
and bring peace to the six realms.

360
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,670
Darn it!

361
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,250
Grief Tree was nourished by love and strengthened greatly.

362
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,330
It suppressed my divine power

363
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,110
and made me so weak.

364
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,200
My recondensed body...

365
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,510
is too useless.

366
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,400
I hope White Fox...

367
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,240
can get what I want.

368
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,490
Get it back.

369
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,530
Next,

370
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,270
find a powerful spirit

371
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,090
to get its Spirit Core.

372
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,720
Guoguo.

373
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,550
Brat.

374
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,270
You promised to wait for me at the market.

375
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,580
Why are you still here?

376
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,440
I...

377
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,530
Yaya.

378
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,720
I was immersed in my cultivation

379
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,150
and forgot the time.

380
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Excuses. I know you.

381
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,110
You must've sneaked out to play.

382
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,840
Did you gather this magic force?

383
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
In an emergency,

384
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,310
it somehow happened.

385
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,750
Not bad.

386
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,200
It seems my efforts

387
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,930
of urging you weren't in vain.

388
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,390
You've improved a lot.

389
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,820
I think highly of you.

390
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,830
Yaya, who do you think highly of?

391
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,240
Lai, listen.

392
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,510
Guoguo's improved rapidly lately.

393
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,270
Aren't I

394
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,680
good at teaching?

395
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,780
So impressive?

396
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,160
I'd like to see it too.

397
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
Guoguo, if you don't mind,

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,940
why don't you spar with me?

399
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,820
Sure.

400
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,480
That's great.

401
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,680
Guoguo, hurry.

402
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,660
Lai's really skilled.

403
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,820
His guidance

404
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,090
will be beneficial.

405
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,320
Are you hurt?

406
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,000
You know Guoguo's not as good as you,

407
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,400
but you didn't hold back.

408
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,700
Let me see.

409
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,440
Yuechu.

410
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,270
You're finally back.

411
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
We heard about

412
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,880
your great performance in Beishan.

413
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
If it weren't for you,

414
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,730
our divine mission

415
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,000
might have failed.

416
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,310
You'd risked your life

417
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,400
for Tushan this time.

418
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,860
So we are

419
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,840
showing our gratitude.

420
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,790
So...

421
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,490
these are all from you guys?

422
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,240
Yes.

423
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,750
Right.

424
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,000
Here.

425
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,180
Take it.

426
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,640
The Book of Bonding?

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,670
Hush.

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,400
This is banned in Tushan.

429
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,560
I asked someone

430
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,110
to get it from Human Market.

431
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,110
I didn't even

432
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,950
get to read it.

433
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,790
Aren't I

434
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,080
a good bro?

435
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,920
Why did you give me this?

436
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,260
Come on.

437
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,310
Who used to

438
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,060
read my hidden books secretly?

439
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,110
I know

440
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,830
you like it.

441
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,640
No, I don't need it. Take it.

442
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,480
Why not?

443
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,450
You're still young.

444
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
You might fall in love one day,

445
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,640
no?

446
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,350
The person I like

447
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,820
already has a sweetheart.

448
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,510
Do you have a crush on a married woman?

449
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
Huh?

450
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,170
She's not married.

451
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,590
That means

452
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,310
she's in a committed relationship with someone else.

453
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,590
Not this too?

454
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,240
Then why are you so down?

455
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,480
You're right.

456
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,420
I'm not bad-looking

457
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,960
and quite humorous.

458
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,700
I can fight when need be

459
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,750
and accompany her all day.

460
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,600
I get along well with people around her.

461
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
I'm such a good catch.

462
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
Why can't she like me?

463
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,540
Yes.

464
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,620
That's right.

465
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,860
But...

466
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,150
you're in the right time and place,

467
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,960
yet you aren't together?

468
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,110
Have you not confessed

469
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,350
to her yet?

470
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,590
You fool.

471
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,110
You seem smart usually.

472
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,710
Why are you so stupid at this?

473
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,240
Who are you calling stupid?

474
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
Who was rejected even after

475
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,830
getting a Feathered Flower?

476
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,890
Jiushuang's just too shy to admit it.

477
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,070
Besides...

478
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,750
do you want to be like me?

479
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,390
That's right.

480
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,510
So chasing happiness

481
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,670
is important.

482
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,420
You have to chase for it.

483
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,650
[Tushan's Twin Peaks]

484
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:29,960
Wait.

485
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,090
Dongfang Luo hasn't woken up,

486
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
but confessing

487
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,510
to Lady Fairy

488
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,670
in front of him seems improper.

489
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,670
This place is decent too.

490
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,010
What should I say to Lady Fairy

491
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,720
when she shows up?

492
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,000
Lady Fairy.

493
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,350
I won't force you to love me.

494
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,480
But before Dongfang Luo wakes up,

495
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,610
let me accompany you

496
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,780
and protect you...

497
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,970
Is that too subservient?

498
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,480
Lady Fairy.

499
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,080
If it weren't for you,

500
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,030
I would've been caught by Tiger and Crane Immortals

501
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,560
and in Jin Renfeng's hands.

502
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
If it weren't for you,

503
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,770
even if I managed to escape,

504
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,280
I'd still be in despair.

505
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,630
I wouldn't know what love is

506
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,520
or make any friends.

507
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,350
Lady Fairy.

508
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,560
It's not just gratitude.

509
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,400
I think about you all the time.

510
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,030
Your presence makes me happy

511
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,630
and your absence worries me.

512
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,910
Lady Fairy.

513
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,250
At first,

514
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,800
having been your sidekick for a long time,

515
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,200
I thought I was confused.

516
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,490
But now I realize

517
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,080
it doesn't matter

518
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,950
how the love started.

519
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,030
I just want to protect you.

520
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,160
It's not for anything else,

521
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,220
but for one person.

522
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,540
That's you.

523
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:03,790
This is good!

524
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,770
Let me tell you.

525
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,160
Confessions should be what the other wants to hear.

526
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,790
No, you have to pour your heart out.

527
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,900
You're wrong.

528
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,530
Words come out of the mouth,

529
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,780
not the heart.

530
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,840
You heard everything

531
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,480
I just said?

532
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,240
Of course.

533
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,810
What do you two babies know?

534
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,910
Remember,

535
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,160
don't tell anyone about today.

536
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
Otherwise...

537
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,600
I won't give you honey anymore.

538
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,760
Don't worry.

539
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,580
We won't tell anyone.

540
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,400
But

541
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
who were you gonna confess to?

542
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,820
Who else?

543
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Other than Chief,

544
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,850
no other women

545
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,430
visits this cave.

546
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,930
But Chief isn't in the cave.

547
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,860
Lady Fairy isn't here?

548
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,020
Since you care so much about my marriage,

549
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,080
let me ask you this.

550
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,770
What am I

551
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,860
to you?

552
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,480
Lady Fairy.

553
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,680
Lady Fairy.

554
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,560
Have a taste.

555
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,470
I cooked this porridge

556
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,410
for four hours.

557
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,580
Chicken soup with rice,

558
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,200
simmered on fruit tree firewood.

559
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,070
Finally,

560
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,490
I tore the chicken breast into thin pieces.

561
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
It's really good.

562
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,760
Try it.

563
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,880
Besides your assigned portion,

564
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,920
you need to pay for extra.

565
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,160
You spent so much...

566
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,420
Don't worry. I put it on your tab.

567
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,010
Besides,

568
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,030
my salary and status are low.

569
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,260
They wouldn't have

570
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,940
sold me a good hen on credit.

571
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,830
That's great.

572
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,110
How is it?

573
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,270
Not bad. You've improved.

574
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,400
Improvement comes with practice.

575
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,240
To make this pot of porridge,

576
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,950
I tried 29 chickens.

577
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,880
This is the 30th.

578
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,260
30th?

579
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,530
But don't worry.

580
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,250
I've given the other 29

581
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,040
to others

582
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,090
and let Rongrong

583
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,920
put them on their tabs.

584
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,170
Aren't I

585
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,640
self-sufficient?

586
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,540
♫With the most mundane of amazements♫

587
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,520
Yummy.

588
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,800
Have some side dishes.

589
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,790
♫We're inseparable in love♫

590
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,750
♫In these bustling scenes♫

591
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,010
When will the class be over?

592
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,180
♫I only listen to your voice♫

593
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,030
Soon.

594
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,600
Wait.

595
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,510
An umbrella in this weather?

596
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,980
♫I use the sun and moon to outline your figure♫

597
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,640
♫Through thick and thin, our memories are exclusive♫

598
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,220
It's going to snow.

599
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,240
Are you crazy?

600
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,360
Snowing

601
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,920
in this weather?

602
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,010
♫I always want to add something, yet it also feels redundant♫

603
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,790
Class dismissed.

604
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,760
-Okay.
-Okay.

605
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,440
♫Footprints next to each other♫

606
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,720
Practice hard.

607
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,610
♫In the perfect distance♫

608
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,240
Yes.

609
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,690
Lady Fairy.

610
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,960
Instead of cultivating,

611
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:20,360
♫Why is our storyline♫

612
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,130
why are you here?

613
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,610
It's going to snow.

614
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm worried about you.

615
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,120
♫Always so incredible?♫

616
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,470
It's really snowing.

618
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,040

♫My breaths depend only on you♫

625

You're making this snow?

646
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,920
Yuechu's so romantic.

647
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,460
He's spending a fortune to pursue Chief.

648
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,380
Yes.

649
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,070
He gave me and Jiushuang

650
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,590
five roasted chickens each.

651
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,720
So generous.

652
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,160
Unlike some fox

653
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,490
who's always so stingy.

654
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,000
He deserves to be

655
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,930
the last single male fox in Tushan.

656
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
Yuechu's pursuing Chief?

657
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,920
But he's a human.

658
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,390
So what?

659
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,160
If you don't believe me,

660
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,760
ask those flower spirits at the back mountain.

661
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,510
It's all over Tushan.

662
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,310
-Why didn’t I know?
-What's all over Tushan?

663
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,540
Nothing.

664
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,180
-What were you guys...
-Elder.

665
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,380
talking about?

666
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,720
Nothing.

667
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,320
How dare you hide it from me?

668
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,680
Rule 108 of Tushan,

669
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,660
Article 73,

670
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,590
if you don't report it, you're an accomplice.

671
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,870
Hiding something is a sin.

672
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,480
Elder.

673
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Here's the thing.

674
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,640
After the matchmaking event,

675
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
the market's revenue has plummeted.

676
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,170
With the extra expenses

677
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,410
for establishing Spirit Alliance,

678
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,510
the account...

679
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,750
Althought it's important to reduce expenses,

680
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,240
it doesn't solve the root cause.

681
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,040
You're right.

682
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,050
I've come up with a plan.

683
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,760
Let me see.

684
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,280
Open a shop in Human Market?

685
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:33,790
Yes.

686
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,270
The herbs and ingredients in Tushan

687
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,030
are very rare in the human realm.

688
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,030
Those merchants sell them secretly

689
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,340
at several times the usual price.

690
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,820
Several times? That much?

691
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,770
But I heard humans

692
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,190
have always been hostile towards spirits.

693
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,770
Will they let us open a shop?

694
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,240
Greetings,

695
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,710
Chief, Deputy Chief, Third-ranking Chief.

696
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,210
Elder, why are you here?

697
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,580
Don't you always talk about self-cultivating?

698
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,000
Who angered you that your beard's crooked?

699
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,930
Deputy Chief.

700
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,060
Don’t make fun of me.

701
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,040
Chief, let me ask you.

702
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,490
What’s going on between you

703
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,160
and that human brat?

704
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,380
What do you mean?

705
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,310
Stop hiding it from me.

706
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,720
It's spread across Tushan

707
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,810
that you and Yuechu are...

708
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,280
in love and intimate.

709
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,000
It's embarrassing just talking about

710
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,270
such immorality.

711
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,180
Who spread the rumor?

712
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,360
Rumor?

713
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,790
Chief.

714
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,360
Don't lie to me about this.

715
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
Yuechu is a decent catch,

716
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,070
but as Tushan's chief,

717
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,660
you're the foxes' role model.

718
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,030
Moreover,

719
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,100
if you end up with a human,

720
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,730
the fox clan's bloodline will be diluted.

721
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,410
Elder.

722
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,330
Don't believe

723
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,200
such groundless rumors.

724
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,240
Fine.

725
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,280
I'll trust it’s just a false rumor.

726
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,320
Chief, please clear the rumors

727
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,750
and set things straight.

728
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,710
What?

729
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,510
Do you feel guilty?

730
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,540
Why'd Honghong feel guilty?

731
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
Don't worry.

732
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,969
This rumor

733
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,710
will not hold beyond three days.

734
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,230
Fine.

735
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:23,739
I'll wait

736
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,540
for the good news, Chief.

737
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,969
Chief, Deputy Chief, Third-ranking Chief.

738
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,420
I’ll take my leave.

739
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,540
Actually, I think Yuechu's decent.

740
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,280
He's kind and considerate to Honghong.

741
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,880
Stop.

742
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,000
I disagree.

743
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,960
Yaya, do you think I'm wrong?

744
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,469
Although this brat is nice,

745
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,590
if he's with Honghong,

746
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,449
I've to call him Brother-in-law.

747
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,710
No way.

748
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,670
I can't do that.

749
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,020
Rongrong, how is it?

750
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
No wonder you're the top shop owner

751
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,970
of Tushan's Spirit Market.

752
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,120
I heard Yuechu likes Chief.

753
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,240
How can humans and spirits fall in love?

754
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,110
Exactly.

755
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,860
How could Chief do such a thing?

756
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,770
Yeah, it's shocking.

757
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,800
Mu Xi.

758
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,440
Your new yogurt tastes good.

759
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,940
You have to taste it yourself to know.

760
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,850
The same applies for other things.

761
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,110
Don't believe and spread rumors easily.

762
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,600
All right.

763
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,870
I'm going to report

764
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,130
to Honghong about the Human Market shop.

765
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Take care, Rongrong.

766
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,210
Honghong.

767
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,410
I've put up Tushan's updated rules.

768
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,840
The last article of not believing and spreading rumors

769
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,030
has been bolded.

770
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,100
But I don't know if it'll work.

771
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,960
Yeah.

772
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,510
I was just at Mu Xi's shop

773
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,190
and saw a sesame spirit and a wolf spirit

774
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,150
secretly discussing it.

775
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,920
Rumors are like wind.

776
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,230
It's hard to stop it

777
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,020
as you can't see or touch it.

778
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,870
Just do your job.

779
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,280
Don't worry about anything else.

780
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,390
Rumors vanish

781
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,580
with time.

782
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,880
I have an idea.

783
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,900
If we prove he has been

784
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,590
intimate with other women,

785
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,260
the rumor will be dispelled.

786
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,810
How can you joke about this?

787
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,630
Honghong, I'm not joking.

788
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,810
He has grown up.

789
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,110
It's time for him to get married.

790
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,510
Maybe

791
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,090
he's had too little contact with other women,

792
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,030
so he's pestering you.

793
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,230
That makes sense.

794
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,710
I heard many humans at Yuechu's age

795
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,320
are already fathers.

796
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,110
Honghong.

797
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,710
Could Yuechu have fallen for a female spirit,

798
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,440
but he just didn't dare tell us?

799
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,360
No way.

800
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,370
Has he really fallen for a spirit?

801
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,480
I've never heard he has a spirit he likes.

802
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,720
Honghong.

803
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,450
You didn't phrase it right.

804
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,360
I doubt any spirits

805
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,150
would be interested in Yuechu.

806
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,080
Since we can't find him a spirit,

807
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,150
why don't we expand the scope

808
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,710
and search among humans?

809
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,740
Good idea.

810
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,570
It's inconvenient for spirits to run a shop at Human Market.

811
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:26,940
We'll get Yuechu to go.

812
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,280
He'll get a blind date

813
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
and we'll expand our business.

814
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,300
Killing two birds with one stone.

815
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,210
Go to Human Market

816
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,490
to run a rouge shop?

817
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
No, no, no.

818
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,850
As a man,

819
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,600
I know nothing about makeup.

820
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,410
If you aren't willing,

821
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,920
let's forget...

822
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,480
I'll calculate

823
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,640
how much you owe us in total.

824
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,320
If you can't pay it back, you must obey Tushan's arrangement.

825
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,550
But...

826
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,650
But rouge shops are full of female customers.

827
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,510
I really can't handle it.

828
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,760
How about...

829
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,080
you ask Jiushuang to go?

830
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
She's always painting her face.

831
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,280
In the entire Tushan,

832
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,810
she knows it best.

833
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,920
During this period,

834
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,450
you've bought 98 chickens,

835
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,180
30 kg of rice, and 100 kg of firewood.

836
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,200
At market price, it's 103.8 taels.

837
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,200
It's 105.3 taels

838
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,950
with an interest of 1.5 taels.

839
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,190
I won't include your living expenses in Tushan.

840
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,490
If you pay off this debt,

841
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,220
you don't have to

842
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,750
tend a shop at Human Market.

843
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,710
Come on.

844
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,760
We agreed

845
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:28,850
to...

846
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,560
put it on the tabs of Lady Fairy

847
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,710
and other spirits who ate the chickens.

848
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,200
Why's it my debt?

849
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
This is so unfair.

850
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,400
I wanted to put it on their tabs,

851
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,220
but they didn't agree.

852
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,750
So I can only ask you for it.

853
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,210
Lady Fairy.

854
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,650
Brat.

855
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,290
Do you really want to see Tushan broke,

856
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,810
and the little spirits starving and cold,

857
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,230
living miserably?

858
00:38:59,360 --> 00:38:59,960
Forget it.

859
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,160
I'll go with him.

860
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,540
[Divine Flame Villa]

861
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,490
The spiritual blood's sullied

862
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,480
and Purest Sun Flame is greatly weakened.

863
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,270
If I don't get into Shi Ji's good graces,

864
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,910
I might even lose my villa master position.

865
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,470
Refined Spirit Core?

866
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,780
[Refined Spirit Core]
