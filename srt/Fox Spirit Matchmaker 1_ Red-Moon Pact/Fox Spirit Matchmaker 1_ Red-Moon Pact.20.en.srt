00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,870
How is it?

5
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,860
You won't go back on your word

6
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,030
in front of so many people, will you?

7
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,250
Yuechu.

8
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,630

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,840
Bravo! Bravo!

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,630
So great!

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,870
Bravo!

Yuechu.

13
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,900
Since you have betrayed Tushan,

14
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
why did you come to us?

15
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
If you hate me for being a traitor,

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,550
why did you come to see me compete?

17
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,079
You...

18
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,880

but it's permanent.

21
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,000
And it's fine if it's permanent, but you are missing a stroke here.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
What are you trying to do?

23
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Well then, when we're back at Tushan,

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,180
I'll add that missing stroke for you.

25
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,640
That depends on whether you are still alive.

26
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,710
After what you did today,

27
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,329
many people will definitely come after you.

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,910
That would be best.

29
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,450
I chose to join the alliance tryout

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,060
because I want more people to know me,

31
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,070
and that includes those who want to come after me.

32
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,070
Why?

33
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,810
Because I need fame,

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,690
a lot of fame at that.

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,960
I didn't expect you to be so vain.

36
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,560
In my opinion, I think

37
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,190
Yuechu just wants more people

38
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,560
to hear his voice.

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
You know me well.

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,430

[Yiqi Alliance]

42
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,400

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,190
hear and believe me.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Only then can I try to make the human race stronger.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,000
And only when the human race becomes stronger

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,330
can the fear and suspicion of the spirit clan be eliminated.

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,430
Only then

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,960
will there be true peace between humans and spirits.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,560
So, does that mean you purposely left Tushan

50
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,840
in order to join the Yiqi Alliance?

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,350
You might hope for everyone to have their own magic tool.

52
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,190
But have you ever considered that

53
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,450
peace between humans and spirits might be too difficult to achieve?

54
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,850
I have to try regardless.

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,160
I can only go back

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,080
after I've tried my best.

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,320
Bye.

58
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,870
Although we didn't catch Guoguo

59
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,270
on our trip down Tushan this time,

60
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,670
it was not all for naught.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,720
Yeah.

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,820
I didn't expect that brat's insistence on going down the mountain

63
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,150
was for the sake of the humans and spirits.

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,510
Just now, he broke free from the fox spell.

65
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,750
That's not easy.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,920
That ungrateful fox.

67
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
If it weren't for the crowd at the recruitment rally,

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,390
I would have knocked him out.

69
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,600
It was a good thing that Yuechu was skillful enough

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
and didn't get caught by him.

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,590
Of course.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,560
You got to look at who he learnt his magic from.

73
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,750
Oh, right.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,330
Who did he learn it from?

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,310
I recall someone groaning every day,

76
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,190
saying that she would never

77
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,450
teach magic to a human.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,870
Who was it?

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,750
That was in the past.

80
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,600
Now, he had gone to such great lengths

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,450
for the sake of Tushan

82
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,650
and my sister.

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,740
I really regret

84
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,510
not teaching him all my magic.

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,920
Well, what I remembered was that he had actually learnt it all.

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
And that gourd.

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,240
When did he took it away

88
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,600
to write nonsense on it?

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,050
I...

90
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,320
That's because I went easy on him.

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,750
Anyway, he's just not as good as me.

92
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,260
Fine.

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,390

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
I'm done talking to you.

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,770
I'm leaving.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
I wonder if my sister will change her mind

97
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,350
if she sees how devoted that brat was.

98
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,770
Your sister wouldn't.

99
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,750
How can you be so sure?

100
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,430
As a friend,

101
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,510
I certainly don't want your sister

102
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,040
to sacrifice her feelings.

103
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,020
But she is not only your sister,

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
but also Yuechu's lover,

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
and my friend.

106
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,500
She is also the chief of Tushan,

107

and the Head of Spirit Alliance.

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,120
Given her position,

109
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
she must bear its weight.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,780
That is her duty and the price of being

111
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,130
a powerful person.

112
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,040
I don't understand.

113
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,540
One day,

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
when you become someone powerful,

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,730
you'll naturally understand.

116
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,040
When I first came to Tushan,

117
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,230
I really hoped you could understand this earlier.

118
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,300
But now,

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,800
I truly hope you would never understand.

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,200
No, I want to understand.

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,390
Then, I can help share

122
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,680

Shi Ji colluded with forces from outside the circle.

130

Is there something wrong with the barrier?

131
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,900
It's possible.

How long will you be gone?

133
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,030

135
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,880
Okay, then we'll make it a three-year promise.

these two so-called research enthusiasts？

What's wrong?

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,330
They said they wanted to

226
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,870
research the methods of making magic tools with me.

227
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,870

most of the problems are centered at Beishan.

236
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,390
It should be because Beishan is in the desert.

237
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,120
With a greater temperature difference between day and night,

238
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,440

Exactly.

244

You just have to add a thermometer inside the magic tool.

After lying around for so long,

372
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,750
I'm afraid it'll be hard to

373
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,960
integrate back into the human race.

374
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,110
If it's convenient,

375
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,510
let me stay here

376
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,880
and be accompanied by books and chess

377
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,140
for the rest of my life.

378
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
It's fine if it's inconvenient.

379
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,070
The six realms are huge.

380
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,310
There's always room for me.

381
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,170
I don't need much on my own anyway.

382
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,770
I owe you my life.

383
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,400
If you want to stay,

384
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,600
that's possible too.

385
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll arrange a place for you.

386
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,110
Thank you,

387
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,880
but no need to bother.

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,790
I've been lying here for hundreds of years.

389
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm used to this place,

390
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,200
so there's no need to move.

391
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,030
I wonder why did Sister called us over

392
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,240
so formally?

393
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,590
Yes.

394
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,660
I just roasted this chicken

395
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,350
and have yet to take a bite

396
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,120
when I received Chief's call.

397
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,310
Sister.

398
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,350
Sister.

399
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,000
This is...

400
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,440
Dongfang Luo.

401
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,840
-Dongfang Luo?
-Dongfang Luo?

402
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,810
You...

403
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,160
I often hear this name,

404
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,590
but it's my first time seeing you in person.

405
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,150
I'm Dongfang Luo. You're...

406
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,270
Tushan Yaya.

407
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Tushan Rongrong.

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,600
Just call me Elder.

409
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,680
Greetings, Elder.

410
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,070
In the future,

411
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,510
Dongfang Luo will stay at the Twin Peaks of Tushan

412
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,170
and live alongside everyone.

413
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,120
He's staying in Tushan?

414
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,000
Chief, I don't think that's appropriate.

415
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,240
Although humans are allowed to stay in Tushan,

416
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,830
he's an outsider after all.

417
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,450
You have a point, Elder.

418
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,130
I'm causing inconvenience by staying behind in Tushan.

419
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,960
But there's no place for me in the human race.

420
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,210
So I shamelessly begged Honghong

421
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,850
to allow me to temporarily stay at Twin Peaks.

422
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,640
Deputy Chief, Third-Ranking Chief,

423
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,960
say something!

424
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,890
Dongfang Luo is the savior of my sister and Rongrong.

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,590
I don't mind if he stays.

426
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,310
Things have been going well in Tushan.

427
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,770
The harvest has been good.

428
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,630
There's no problem in supporting one more person.

429
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,310
Elder,

430
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
what do you think?

431
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,890
I...

432
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,720
No objection.

433
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,960
This old fox completely agrees.

434
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,550
Well then, I'll go tell other fox spirits

435
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,410
to be polite when they meet Dongfang Luo.

436
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,750
They must not be rude.

437
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,840
Thank you.

438
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,790
You're welcome.

439
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,720
You're welcome.

440
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,140
Have you made up your mind?

441
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,690
Previously, I only studied scriptures and philosophies.

442
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,820
I knew nothing about actual practice.

443
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,660
Now that I've woken up, instead of indulging in empty talk,

444
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,750
I would rather study medicine

445
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,280
to save oneself and others.

446
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,240
Fine.

447
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll ask Rongrong to prepare some medical books for you.

448
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,340
You're not familiar with this mountain.

449
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,350
Wherever you want to go,

450
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,550
you can ask the foxes to show you the way.

451
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,160
Thank you.

452
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,370
[Tushan]

453
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,250
There's none.

454
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,830
That is...

455
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,830
Chief has set rules.

456
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,700
No one can leave Tushan without permission.

457
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,310
Come back.

458
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,140
Sorry.

459
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I was reckless.

460
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,440
May I ask...

461
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,540
is that village over there part of the human race's territory?

462
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,790
That place?

463
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,830
It's Hulu Village.

464
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,690
It's part of Tushan's territory.

465
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,680
There are indeed

466
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,260
humans living there.

467
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
There are humans?

468
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:56,960
Who is it?

469
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,280
An old friend of Tushan,

470
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,400
called Dongfang Yuechu.

471
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,460
I'll go back first.

472
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,790
Dongfang Yuechu?

473
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,070
It's him.

474
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,350
Savior!

475
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,680
Dongfang Luo?

476
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,580
You're awake?

477
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,130
Thank you for saving me.

478
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,510
I'll give you ten years of my vitality.

479
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,640
When did you wake up?

480
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,400
Does Honghong know?

481
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,550
I just woke up a few days ago.

482
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,210
Thanks to Honghong's kindness,

483
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,010
I can continue to stay in Tushan.

484
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,120
You want to stay in Tushan?

485
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,790
You came here

486
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,510
just to thank me?

487
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm ashamed.

488
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,350
I knew I've been greatly indebted to you

489
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,750
back when I was in my soul.

490
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,000
However, I didn't see you when I woke up.

491
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,710
If I hadn't gone out to collect herbs,

492
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,380
and found the scent of you nearby,

493
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,330
I wouldn't have known when I could thank you personally.

494
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,240
Enough.

495
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,010
Stop calling me your savior.

496
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,800
I saved you

497
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,380
because of Honghong.

498
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,190
According to the human race,

499
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,770
I'm Honghong's sidekick,

500
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,310
and you are Honghong's friend.

501
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,780
So naturally, you are my friend.

502
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,580
It's only right to save a friend.

503
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,790
Friend?

504
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,350
Yes.

505
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,960
Dongfang Luo.

506
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Let's be friends.

507
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
Sure.

508
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,700
It's your first time here.

509
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,830
I'll give you a gift.

510
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,110
Here.

511
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,130
This item is great, whether it's for decocting medicine

512
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,260
or making porridge.

513
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
With this,

514
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,900
you don't have to go to Tushan for free meals.

515
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,730
This...

516
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,870
Take it.

517
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,770
It's my token of appreciation.

518
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,800
Thank you.

519
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,050
It's my honor to be friends with you, Yuechu,

520
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,110
who is this cool and spontaneous.

521
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,770
I'm a great friend, right?

522
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,750
Not only I'll make friends with you,

523
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,320
but I'll get all the spirits of Tushan

524
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,640
to be friends with you.

525
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,030
From now on, I will pester you to no end,

526
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
and keep you occupied at all times,

527
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,670
so that you have no time to bother Honghong.

528
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,330
[Tushan Academy]

529
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,950
How is it?

530
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,680
The novella I recommended is good, right?

531
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,070
What happened to that female spirit who defeated her enemies

532
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,670
after self-learning magic?

533
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,630
Wait, you don't know?

534
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,920
Mr. Dongfang,

535
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,160
give me some pointers.

536
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,840
Looking at the color of the mountains,

537
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,230
should I color it thicker or thin it out?

538
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,830
The novellas in this world

539
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,160
are more or less the same.

540
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,050
Ms. Jiushuang,

541
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,810
let's call it a day.

542
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,350
The study of scriptures is not just a one-time affair.

543
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,900
After taking revenge,

544
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,560
it will always be about romance.

545
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,690
What I've taught you

546
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,700
should be enough for you to study for more than half a year.

547
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,170
Ms. Wuli, I'm sorry.

548
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,240
I don't know much about calligraphy.

549
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,000
It's okay if you don't.

550
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,350
Just comment from the perspective of a bystander.

551
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,510
Her master

552
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,360
chose to be with someone else.

553
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,610
You could even draw on it directly.

554
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,730
Mr. Dongfang.

555
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:11,850
I still don't know what it means to

556
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,280
focus on the scripture from one's heart, and not on the paper.

557
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,230
We've gone over

558
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,770
this sentence at least thrice.

559
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,760
Brother Luo.

560
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,330
Why are you here?

561
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,160
It might sound funny.

562
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,480
I found out that

563
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,700
the foxes in Tushan seem particularly welcoming.

564
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,250
They're awfully passionate, aren't they?

565
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,050
That's right, it's quite scary.

566
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,270
Then that's right.

567
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,350
Let me tell you.

568
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,570
The fox spirits of Tushan are very difficult to deal with.

569
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,040
Especially those vixens.

570
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,040
If you see them, you should stay away from them.

571
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,440
Thank you for the tip.

572
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,370
Brother Luo.

573
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,440
Have a seat.

574
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,410
My place is a bit messy.

575
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,880
Please don't mind me.

576
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,750
It's okay.

577
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,930
Here, have a seat.

578
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,290
I'll get you some water.

579
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,090
Thank you.

580
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,440
This... This...

581
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,230
This...

582
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,440
This...

583
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,340
This is the chair my mother made before she died.

584
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,100
It's the only one in the world.

585
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,200
I'm really sorry.

586
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm sure it can be fixed

587
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,630
with a bit of work.

588
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,680
But I don't know how to fix it.

589
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,790
Every time I think of my mother,

590
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,620
I would sit on this chair.

591
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,440
As long as I sit on it,

592
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,010
I would feel relieved.

593
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,070
It's as if she's still alive.

594
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,070
But now...

595
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,320
I can fix it.

596
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,610
I'll fix it for you.

597
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,230
And this house...

598
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,270
It was previously destroyed by thugs.

599
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,730
I had finally restored it after much effort.

600
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,270
Just now,

601
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,350
when you broke the chair,

602
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,510
the house also shook.

603
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I'm afraid it's not structurally sound anymore.

604
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,270
I'll... I'll fix it.

605
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,160
I'll come and fix your house every day.

606
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,400
I'll definitely restore your place to what it was.

607
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,540
Thank you, Luo.

608
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,050
By the way, Luo,

609
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,680
is there something else you came here for?

610
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,640
I almost forgot.

611
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,150
[Emptiness Magic]

612
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,380
Emptiness Magic?

613
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,310
My mother told me about it.

614
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,060
Purest Sun Flame and Emptiness Magic

615
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,590
are secret techniques that the Dongfang family has lost for a long time.

616
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,380
This Emptiness Magic

617
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,340
has been lost for nearly a century.

618
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,480
Why do you have this book?

619
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,330
It's not the original.

620
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,960
Many years ago,

621
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,550
I was lucky enough to have read this book

622
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,880
at Dongfang family's library.

623
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,640
After that, the war between humans and spirits broke out,

624
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,620
and the library was destroyed by a fire.

625
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,640
The ten thousand over books inside were completely destroyed.

626
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,160
Since I got to meet you,

627
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,030
the authentic disciple of the spiritual blood,

628
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,630
and on the account that you've saved me,

629
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,110
I wrote this from my memory.

630
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:15,110
I thought it might help you with your cultivation.

631
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,880
How kind of you.

632
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,800
Thank you, Luo.

633
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,130
And this chair and house...

634
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,590
Please remember to fix it.

635
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,070
That's what I should do.

636
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,040
This is the medical book you were looking for.

637
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,970
Sorry to trouble you again.

638
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,440
I hear you've been

639
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,740
teaching the foxes to identify herbs.

640
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,630
It seems that your medical skills have improved.

641
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,100
I'm just learning as I go along too,

642
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,190
and then passing it on to the foxes.

643
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,930
It's not worth mentioning.

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,630
Sister.

645
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,030
What is it?

646
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,490
Recently, many female disciples from Yiqi Alliance have gone missing.

647
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,320
They've got a lot of different opinions within themselves.

648
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,180
Some people think it's the work of

649
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,790
the spirit clan from the Spirit Alliance.

650
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,260
Do they have any evidence?

651
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,320
No.

652
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
If they could produce the evidence,

653
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,710
Wangquan Hongye wouldn't

654
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,330
sit on the sidelines like he is now.

655
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,450
Since there is no evidence,

656
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,380
why would anyone think it was done by the spirit clan?

657
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,510
It is said that

658
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,210
the first one who suspected the spirit clan

659
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,670
was the Nangong Family of the Yiqi Alliance.

660
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,160
The Nangong family?

661
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,230
Yes.

662
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,940
Let Elder investigate this as soon as possible.

663
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,550
If there are evil spirits causing trouble,

664
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,810
I won't tolerate them.

665
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,190
Yes.

666
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,780
Emptiness Magic

667
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,950
lies in one's sincerity.

668
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,800
Tears fall,

669
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,670
and time is turning.

670
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,400
The greatest

671
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,860
is born out of the most profound love.

672
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,300
Strange.

673
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,930
Why is this Emptiness Magic

674
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,320
working against the techniques I had previously learnt?

675
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,000
Why are you here again?

676
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,280
What is it?

677
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,210
I wanted to tell you something new.

678
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,360
If you don't want to see me,

679
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,040
I'll have some tea and leave.

680
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,230
Something new?

681
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,040
What is it?

682
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,190
Tell me.

683
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,650
I'll tell you if you beg me.

684
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,710
Fine.

685
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,570
Just forget it.

686
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,670
Whatever.

687
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,840
Anyway,

688
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,800
many female disciples

689
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,960
from Yiqi Alliance went missing recently.

690
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,620
Everyone said it was Spirit Alliance behind it.

691
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,490
If it was Yiqi Alliance who had missing disciples...

692
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,440
Why do they insist that it was the work of Spirit Alliance?

693
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,190
I don't know the details.

694
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,970
But I heard...

695
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,800
it's the Nangong family creating the most noise.

696
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,800
Nangong Shi?

697
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,760
By the way,

698
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,040
these are the information you asked me to collect

699
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
[Nangong]

700
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,920
on the various aristocrats of Yiqi Alliance over the past three years.

701
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
I've brought it all over.

702
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,030
You're smart.

703
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,230
As expected, it was NangongShi

704
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,430
who instructued those people to target Spirit Alliance.

705
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,760
I've been running around

706
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,000
to gather the things you've asked for.

707
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,110
I wonder if you would fulfil

708
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,170
your side of the promise, Sir.

709
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,190
Don't worry.

710
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,920
As long as the Nangong family

711
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,020
stick to the plan as discussed,

712
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,000
the position of Yiqi Alliance's director

713
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,530
would definitely be yours.

714
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,850
When did the Nangong family have such a nobleman?

715
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
Thank you, Sir.

716
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,880
This is not the only thing you have to thank me for.

717
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,140
About your father...

718
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,030
My lord,

719
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,550
a man outside claiming to be Yuechu wants to see you.

720
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,880
Dongfang Yuechu?

721
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,520
What is he doing here?

722
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,350
Although he's been showing off,

723
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,450
he has yet to officially take over Divine Flame Villa.

724
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,470
It seems...

725
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,680
he wants something from me.

726
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,960
Dongfang Yuechu?
