[Episode 7]

4
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,850
This muscular body...

5
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,260
You're indeed worthy of being the princess' personal spirit guard.

6
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,570
You're so majestic and imposing.

7
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,080
I have the best Chunlin wine here.

8
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,320
Do you want to try it?

9
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,480
We'll do it secretly. They wouldn't know.

10
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,470
You don't drink?

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,150
It's... a good habit.

12
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,210
Good habit indeed.

13
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,870
Brother,

14
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,150
since you spend so much time with the princess,

15
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,310
do you know

16
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,910
what was the gift she came all the way to Tushan,

17
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,070
just to give to our Chief?

18
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,380
Tell me something.

19
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,750
Are you serious about getting attached to a spirit?

20
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,720
I've made up my mind.

21
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
I know

22
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,250
Tushan has never dealt with the human race before.

23
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,000
If it weren't for the fact that

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,329
the white epiphyllum has gone extinct over the past few centuries,

25
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,320
you wouldn't be asking me,

26
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,090
a human, for the flower either.

27
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,500
But regardless, I hope you can keep your promise, Chief.

28
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,110
Please let me and Shi Kuan get attached under the Grief Tree.

29
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,710
The person you like is Guard Shi?

30
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,640
Chief, you must be surprised.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,290
Actually, I didn’t expect it either.

32
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,640
Kuan was the spirit guard Father assigned to me.

33
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,430
But we played and grew up together.

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,960
Wherever I go,

35
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,430
he would be by my side.

36
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,870
Until one day,

37
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,470
I almost lost him.

38
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,910
When I saw him fall into my arms,

39
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,390
at that moment, I felt

40
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,360
an unprecedented fear.

41
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,200
Only then I realized

42
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,600
I've already regarded him

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,800
as the most important person in my life.

44
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,980
I've already fallen in love with him.

45
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Does Guard Shi know

46
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,230
about your feelings for him?

47
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,190
My father would never let me fall in love with Shi Kuan.

48
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,040
If others ever sense something is wrong,

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,920
it'll be disastrous to Shi Kuan and his mother.

50
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,370
I don’t want to give him pressure.

51
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,150
So does Guard Shi also like you?

52
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,540
Although he has never admitted it,

53
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,390
I know he likes me too.

54
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,250
I believe the Grief Tree

55
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,740
will definitely feel our love.

56
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,160
I know humans and spirits don't have the same lifespan.

57
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,390
I just ask for the Grief Tree to witness our love.

58
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,470
I hope the Grief Tree

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,360
can feel our love,

60
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,110
and help us

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
overcome obstacles

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,510
to be together.

63
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,630
Chief, I hope you can help me.

64
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,400
You don't have to do this.

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,460
Please have a seat.

66
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,409
I don't mean to refuse.

67
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,870
It's just that

68
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,120
there has never been an instance where

69
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,510
a human tries to get attached to a spirit in front of the Grief Tree.

70
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,840
Hence, even I'm not sure

71
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,350
what will happen after a human gets attached to a spirit.

72
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Perhaps, it may disappoint you.

73
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,570
If there had never been a human-spirit relationship before,

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,090
I'm willing to take this path that no one has ever walked.

75
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm willing to do whatever it takes, even if it's hard.

76
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
No matter what,

77
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,630
I'm willing to give it a try.

78
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,270
I believe you'll understand me.

79
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,370
Otherwise, in the past few hundred years,

80
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,160
you wouldn't have persevered

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,480
on your search for white epiphyllum.

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,940
You even went out of your way to ask me, a human, for this flower.

83
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,190
The fragrance of the white epiphyllum lasts forever.

84
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,830
I hope this flower can fulfill your wish, Chief.

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I still haven’t figured out what

86
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,830
what Lady Fairy went to the Spirit-Master Kingdom to ask for.

87
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,760
That spirit guard was so stubborn.

88
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,080
Even Chunlin wine from the old fox couldn't buy him over.

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,440
I was about to go out,

90
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,600
and I couldn't find my dearest Chunlin wine.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,330
So you were the one who stole it.

92
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,290
Old fox.

93
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,560
You almost killed me before.

94
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,340
What's wrong with stealing some of your wine?

95
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,000
Let alone your stealing wine,

96
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,240
even if I destroyed your fox nest,

97
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,330
you should also...

98
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
Stop drinking.

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,610
Even then, you can't be stealing my wine!

100
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,970
Little rascal.

101
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,920
Were you the one who stole all the Chunlin wine

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
which had went missing previously?

103
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,360
So what if did?

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,540
So what if I didn't?

105
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,530
So that means you stole it.

106
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,870
In that case,

107
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,120
don't blame me for being rude.

108
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,070
I... I...

109
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,480
Jiaojiao!

110
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
I will beat you to death!

111
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,950
-Stop!
-Jiaojiao.

112
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,310
You are so mean!

113
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,000
What did you say?

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,950
Say it again!

115
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,170
Jiaojiao, I wouldn't dare to say a thing when you are so fierce.

116
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,230
I want you to say it.

117
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,260
Alright, enough.

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,900
Elder, Elder.

119
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,320
I was wrong. I was wrong.

120
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,070
Give it to me.

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,610
You can have it.

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,190
You have to answer one question first.

123
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,950
What is it?

124
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,480
What did the Spirit-Master Kingdom give Lady Fairy

125
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,340
on their trip to Tushan this time?

126
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,020
You don't know?

127
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,160
That's fine too.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
It has nothing to do with you anyway.

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,770
Give it to me.

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,720
S-Slow down.

131
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,760
It's all because of your Dongfang family.

132
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,510
All of you are so difficult to deal with.

133
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,360
The Spirit-Master Kingdom's princess traveled for thousands of miles just to give the white epiphyllum flower.

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,909
She must be wanting to use this flower

135
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,140
to nourish the soul of Dongfang Luo.

136
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,320
Dongfang Luo?

137
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,179
Let me tell you.

138
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,070
Six petals of the white epiphyllum can preserve the soul of a human.

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,530
When Dongfang Luo was in danger,

140
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,000
Chief protected his soul with this very flower,

141
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,910
and placed it within the white epiphyllum formation at the Twin Peaks.

142
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,030
This flower withers once every century.

143
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,870
Chief has taken great pains

144
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,470
to replace the flower every century,

145
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,140
just to protect his soul.

146
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,960
When the time is right, she'll then call him back.

147
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,030
Dongfang Luo?

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,270
Soul?

[Tushan Double Peak]

150
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,090
This black fog is extremely negative and evil.

151
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,350
It can be resisted with Purest Sun Flame.

152
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,540
Amplify the Divine Flame.

153
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,070
Your Purest Sun Flame has broken through the second level.

154
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,750
Is he the old friend you saw in your dream?

155
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:17,960
Oh no.

156
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,570
Lady Fairy, don't.

157
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,720
You have yet to fully recover.

158
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,710
If you use so much of your power,

159
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,430
it will definitely hurt your body.

160
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,910
The white epiphyllum is already destroyed.

161
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,450
If we don't protect him with spirit power,

162
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,620
his soul will be burnt to ashes.

163
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,110
Yuechu!

164
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,470
Yuechu.

165
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,340
Why are you doing this?

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,990
Do you know that

167
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,630
although the human breathe can protect the soul,

168
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,630
as time passes,

169
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,320
the soul will consume your qi and blood,

170
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,380
and hurt the body which is nursing it.

171
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,020
It doesn't matter.

172
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,200
Have you forgotten that I've always been your sidekick?

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,300
I should do my best

174
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,390
to protect you

175
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,450
and make you happy.

176
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,750
Since you care so much about this soul,

177
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,280
I should protect it for you.

178
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,240
Yuechu.

179
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,910
It's okay.

180
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
I have Purest Sun Flame protecting me.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
This little bit of qi and blood is nothing to me.

182
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
But exactly who touched this

183
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
white epiphyllum?

184
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,080
The outer shell is crispy while the filling is runny.

185
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,240
I didn't expect the black sesame pills in the Spirit Market

186
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
to be so delicious and interesting.

187
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,510
Kuan, try some.

188
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,000
I dare not.

189
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,120
If you like it,

190
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll be happy just by seeing you eat.

191
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:07,860
This is an order.

192
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,200
How is it? Is it delicious?

193
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,130
Your Highness,

194
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,330
it's very delicious.

195
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,390
Let's go. Hurry up.

196
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,240
There won't be any left if we're late.

197
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,510
Time to see the laterns!

198
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,630
Don't go alone.

199
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,590
Wait for us.

200
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,600
Wait for us.

201
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,790
Slow down.

202
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,170
Are you envious?

203
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,390
Actually, this is what spirits should look like.

204
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,650
The Spirit-Master Kingdom is truly not a great place to be.

205
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,970
There are good people in the Spirit-Master Kingdom too.

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,200
I came to Tushan to seek marriage.

207
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,390
Aren't you curious about who I like?

208
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,340
If you wanted to tell me,

209
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,190
you would have told me.

210
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,390
Regardless of who you like,

211
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,610
I will always protect you.

212
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

213
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,830
You're too harsh.

214
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,440
Shi Kuan and I have been living in the Spirit-Master Kingdom for a long time.

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
And now, we get to enjoy the views of Tushan.

216
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,240
Get lost!

217
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,000
You must give us an explanation!

218
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,910
After we capture Spirit-Master Kingdom's princess,

219
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,210
I'll eat her up as an appetizer.

220
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,690
Shan, you're awesome!

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
Awesome!

222
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,410
Shall we eat something?

223
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,340
Let's eat first.

224
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,950
Eat first?

225
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,910
Let's go!

226
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,440
Let's go!

227
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,070
I'm sure... I'm the cause of the commotion again.

228
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,670
Don't worry.

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,630
If Tushan can't even solve such a trivial matter,

230
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,090
how dare we make a promise?

231
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
The both of you,

232
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,930
please.

233
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Flowers for sale!

234
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,740
What kind of trouble can a small gangster

235
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,140
like Chi Shan cause?

236
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,350
As the deputy chief of Tushan,

237
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,130
I can take care of him with a flick of my finger.

238
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,320
So confident?

239
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,840
I heard that the original form of Chi Shan

240
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,970
is a fire dragon.

241
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,280
He might be somebody afterall.

242
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,660
Don't you dare put down others to make yourself look good.

243
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,350
What fire dragon?

244
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,990
It's just a small snake

245
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,560
which has yet to fully evolve.

246
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,860
Just judging by size,

247
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,140
you're already on the losing end.

248
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,860
If you can't handle him,

249
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,980
remember to inform me.

250
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,780
I'll help you.

251
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,150
What a joke.

252
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,630
Me begging you?

253
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,720
You'd better get behind me.

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,620
I, Tushan Yaya,

255
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,030
beat up tigers in the south with my fists,

256
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,910
and kicked the evil dragon in the north.

257
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,510
I have more than what it takes

258
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,550
to deal with such a tiny snake.

259
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,600
Shan,

260
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,820
is this your first time here at the Spirit Market?

261
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,220
The deputy chief of Tushan?

262
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,270
L-Let me tell you.

263
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,070
Don't try to be friendly with me.

264
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,420
Hand over the Spirit-Master Kingdom's princess,

265
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,080
and I'll spare Tushan's life.

266
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,170
That's a big statement and temper.

267
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
But are you sure you are confident of

268
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,610
fighting against Tushan on your own?

269
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Who said I'm alone?

270
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,380
My brothers are all outside Tushan.

271
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,440
If you don't hand her over,

272
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,170
I'll destroy Tushan in no time.

273
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,390
Okay.

274
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,420
You're a frank and straightforward spirit.

275
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,680
I, Tushan Yaya, have made you my friend.

276
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,500
How about this?

277
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,970
Let's discuss.

278
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,480
About what?

279
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,290
Waiter, serve some dishes with more wine.

280
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,960
Let's give Shan a jug of

281
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,750
our famous tipsy brew.

282
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,589
Okay.

283
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,349
Good food goes with good wine.

284
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,010
Only then you'd have made the trip worth, right?

285
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,590
I know the Grief Tree has never matchmade between humans and spirits.

286
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,920
But true love knows no boundaries.

287
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,480
Since the Grief Tree is a sacred tree,

288
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,350
it can definitely see through our differences as human and spirit,

289
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,790
and feel our love.

290
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,270
Previously,

291
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,240
whenever a spirit couple makes a pact under the Grief Tree,

292
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,100
and if they truly love each other,

293
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,070
the Grief Tree will feel their sincerity,

294
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,670
and give its blessings within a few days.

295
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,040
And the vixens of Tushan

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,320
will also carry out the mission of

297
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,070
clearing obstacles in their relationship

298
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,530
to help them get together.

299
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,970
So if humans and spirits

300
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,730
also truly love each other,

301
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,510
can the vixens of Tushan

302
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,240
help them overcome obstacles and stay together?

303
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,110
As long as it's the love recognized by the Grief Tree,

304
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,510
Tushan will do our best to help.

305
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,240
It's just that

306
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,440
there is no precedent for a human-spirit relationship in Tushan.

307
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,810
Even as the chief,

308
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,780
I'm not confident

309
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,120
nor can I guarantee that the Grief Tree

310
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,850
will bless your relationship.

311
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,060
Thank you for your careful arrangement.

312
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,170
Even if it's a one-in-a-million chance,

313
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,570
I'd like to give it a shot.

314
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,250
Although my lover

315
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,070
doesn't know of my feelings,

316
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,310
but I really love him.

317
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,650
My only wish is to be with him forever.

318
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,450
I hope the Grief Tree

319
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,020
can bless us with a Feathered Flower,

320
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,270
Especially on the account that there was once me,

321
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,100
♫When my gaze passes through the long night♫

322

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,010
♫The wind blows and makes my heart flutter♫

369
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,030
♫But it's using falling leaves to prepare for this life's parting♫

370
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,700
♫Love and hate are related to you♫

371
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,550
♫Our meeting was not in vain♫

372
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
I do.

373
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,920
I do.

374
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
Lady Fairy,

375
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,170
are you just like Bu Tai?

376
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,550
Waiting for a hundred years after another hundred years,

377
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,270
and never giving up

378
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,820
just for that small possibility,

379
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,920
What kind of butterfly is this?

380
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,000
So beautiful.

381
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,110
This is the spiritual butterfly of Tushan.

382
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,100
It's an ancient spirit insect used to pass messages.

383
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,200
Then it's a good thing.

384
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,880
Do you want to know what it said?

385
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,340
What did it say?

386
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,640
It said,

387
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,680
"It seems like there are just...

388
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,960
about six or seven people in total."

389
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,850
Nonsense!

390
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,410
You used poison?

391
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,920
If we could save some of our energy

392
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,960
when dealing with these evil spirits, we should.

393
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,020
As long as it works.

394
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,830
That's true.

395
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,140
But what kind of powerful poison is that?

396
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,610
It's a secret.

397
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,480
Someone tampered with the white epiphyllum?

398
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm only telling you now

399
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,640
because I don't want to affect your matchmaking.

400
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,500
How could it be?

401
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,400
I had purposely set

402
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
seals and charms around the flower.

403
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,650
I've been carrying it with me all the way.

404
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,050
No one could approach it.

405
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,210
In that case,

406
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,310
it means that they must have touched

407
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,790
the white epiphyllum back in Spirit-Master Kingdom.

408
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,120
That's impossible too.

409
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,590
The white epiphyllum is the royal flower of the Spirit-Master Kingdom's imperial household.

410
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,720
It only exists within the palace.

411
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,010
There are even dedicated caretakers looking after it.

412
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,340
No ordinary man can get close enough to it.

413
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,010
If this person is from within the palace,

414
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,400
or has extraordinary spirit power,

415
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,590
it is possible to get close to the white epiphyllum without a sound.

416
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,480
Either way,

417
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,920
it means something is going on within the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

418
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,520
Let me escort the princess back to our kingdom.

419
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,560
Your Highness, don't worry.

420
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,160
The fact that this person only dared to destroy the flower in secret,

421
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,880
means that

422
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,030
he is not powerful enough to fight against Spirit-Master Kingdom directly.

423
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,350
Chief, do you mean...

424
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,030
Chi Shan is causing trouble in Tushan.

425
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,180
This means someone wants to use him

426
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,780
to stop you from returning to Spirit-Master Kingdom as planned.

427
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,200
Then my father...

428
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,870
Your Highness, don't worry.

429
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,580
I will escort you back as soon as possible.

430
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,480
Lady Fairy,

431
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,670
I know my way around Tushan.

432
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,070
Let me send you two out of Tushan,

433
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,070
and back to Spirit-Master Kingdom.

434
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,930
Don't worry.

435
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,110
The current me

436
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,720
is not the same as the Yuechu

437
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,680
who could only take beatings at the Human Market.

438
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,530
Moreover,

439
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,030
the Spirit-Master Kingdom has always been enemies with the spirit clan.

440
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,430
If we send other spirits,

441
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,670
it might cause more trouble instead.

442
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,830
Your Highness,

443
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,030
please wait a moment.

444
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,830
Follow me.

445
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,510
Lady Fairy.

446
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,450
Within the Spirit-Master Kingdom,

447
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,440
the conflict between the human race and the spirit clan has been intensified.

448
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,550
Additionally, someone is trying to sow discord.

449
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,350
You must be careful on this trip.

450
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,560
Don't worry.

451
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,270
Lady Fairy.

452
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,250
Before I make my way to Spirit-Master Kingdom and meet up with you,

453
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,240
this Heaven & Earth Thread that has my breath

454
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,100
can help you to get out of trouble.

455
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,330
When I'm not around,

456
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,580
please take care of yourself.

457
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,860
It'll be a dangerous trip.

458
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,600
Remember to keep me posted.

459
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,210
I'll be off.

460
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,760
Gujin.

461
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,580
How dare you stop the Princess' carriage?

462
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,790
The human race of the Spirit-Master Kingdom has been bullying us for hundreds of years.

463
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,740
[Spirit-Master Kingdom's spirit slave, Gujin]

464
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,710
Now, it's finally our chance to become masters.

465
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,920
Shi Kuan, move!

466
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,480
I don't care what you want to do.

467
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
But if you want to endanger Her Highness...

468
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,600
You shall not.

469
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,960
As spirits,

470
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,300
I don't want to kill each other.

471
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:18,990
Step aside.

472
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,310
You wouldn't?

473
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,890
Then don't blame me

474
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,060
for disregarding our friendship of hundreds of years.

475
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,730
The princess is missing!

476
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,490
The are much fewer spirit slaves on the streets now.

477
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,210
As Chief had expected,

478
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,080
there has been a change in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

479
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,810
Let's go to the palace and meet your father first.

480
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,200
Where's Bu Tai?

481
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,240
Gujin.

482
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,200
It's not too late to turn back.

483
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,460
Turn back?

484
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Shi Kuan.

485
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
It won't take you long

486
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,640
before you're with us.

487
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,880
Let's go.

488
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,040
Mu Xi, did you really asked us here

489
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,990
just for us to drink yoghurt?

490
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,550
It's creamy, rich and has many fruity bits.

491
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,810
It tastes really good.

492
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,240
This yoghurt will surely be a bestseller across the spirit clan.

493
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,830
So,

494
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,550
isn't it time to raise your rent?

495
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,920
No way.

496
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,870
Seven-colored Luminance?

497
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,590
The direction in which the Feathered Flowers are scattered

498
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,320
is Sister's Huguang Pavilion.

499
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,860
Go check it out.

500
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,210
The Chief of Tushan

501
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,390
[Bu Tai, Shi Kuan]

502
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,430
has never personally executed a matchmaking mission.

503
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,110
This is really strange.

504
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,750
The Grief Tree not only

505
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,210
gave you a divine mission,

506
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,570
it even arranged such a strange task.

507
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:38,480
Maybe, it's the Grief Tree's method of self-rescue.

508
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,540
If Honghong completes the task,

509
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,610
not only the Grief Tree,

510
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,410
but Honghong may also gain a powerful force of love

511
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,720
to save herself.

512
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,240
Love between a human and spirit is fraught with challenges.

513
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,400
But if they indeed get attached,

514
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,240
their love must be very strong.

515
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,960
Perhaps that's why the Grief Tree gave such a difficult mission

516
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
to you, Sister.

517
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,740
No matter what,

518
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,350
Tushan needs to protect this relationship.

519
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,680
I'll go to the Spirit-Master Kingdom now.

520
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,780
It's too dangerous to go there now.

521
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,640
Yaya.

522
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,400
The divine mission is no trivial matter.

523
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,460
If it's not completed,

524
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,790
not only the Grief Tree,

525
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,400
but the entire Tushan will be implicated.

526
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
Why don't I go with you?

527
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,830
No.

528
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,880
The Elder is not here now.

529
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,680
We need someone to guard Tushan,

530
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,550
in case someone tries to take advantage of us.

531
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,640
What about you?

532
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Sister.

533
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,160
It's reasonable for Yaya to worry.

534
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,820
You have yet to fully recover.

535
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,750
It's really not a good idea to venture out on your own.

536
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,830
In my opinion,

537
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,040
if you must go,

538
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,580
why don't you bring some men with you?

539
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,600
Besides Yaya,

540
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,790
there's no shortage of foxes in Tushan who have spirit powers.

541
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,640
Lai.

542
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,310
Let Lai go with you.

543
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,690
Although his power is a bit weak,

544
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,490
he's pretty good with poison.

545
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,030
In case of danger,

546
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,440
you could use poison to buy time.

547
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm sure he can run away with you.

548
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,810
Stop!

549
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,170
Your Highness!

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,650
Elder Xu.

551
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,740
Your Highness?

552
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

553
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,500
You’re finally back.

554
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,570
[Elder of Spirit-Master Kingdom, Xu Yi]

555
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,720
Where is Guard Shi?

556
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,250
Why isn't he escorting you?

557
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Who is this?

558
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm Yuechu.

559
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,750
Tushan sent me to escort Her Highness.

560
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,640
As for Guard Shi, he will be here soon.

561
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,400
Tushan?

562
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,490
Your Highness.

563
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,420
Elder Xu, I'll explain later.

564
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,670
Where is my father?

565
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,080
The medicine just now...

566
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,880
Ever since you left,

567
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,550
His Majesty has been suffering from a sudden, acute illness.

568
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,830
The imperial physicians couldn't find the cause either.

569
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,670
Your Highness, you should go in now.

570
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,730
His Majesty has been waiting for you.

571
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,960
Mr. Yuechu, please wait.

572
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,410
Her Highness and His Majesty share a deep bond.

573
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,930
We shouldn't disturb them as outsiders.

574
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,490
You're right.

575
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,360
Thank you for reminding me.

576
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Goodbye.

577
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,500
[King of Spirit-Master Kingdom]

578
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,480
Father.

579
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,680
Father.

580
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,190
I'm unfilial.

581
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,550
I failed to return in time.

582
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,760
How did you get so ill, Father?

583
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,160
Life and death are predestined.

584
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,910
No one could've predicted this.

585
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,830
Bu Tai.

586
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,830
My days are numbered.

587
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,030
Recently,

588
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,510
I've gathered

589
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,610
the Mother Talisman of all spirit slaves in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

590
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,160
You must keep it safe.

591
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,830
Without the talisman,

592
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,370
the spirits

593
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
would definitely gather and rebel.

594
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,490
By then,

595
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,040
the situation will be out of control.

596
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,570
The country will be destroyed.

597
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,030
Don't worry, Father.

598
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
I, Bu Tai,

599
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,310
will do my best to protect the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

600
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,550
Good girl.

601
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,310
I know that

602
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,790
although you look weak,

603
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,830
but you are the strongest and most decisive.

604
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,100
The Spirit-Master Kingdom

605
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,550
is now in your hands.

606
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,470
In the future,

607
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,200
I can no longer protect you.

608
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,830
You must...

609
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,710
live well on your own.

610
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,190
[Spirit-Master Kingdom]

611
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,270
It's all my fault.

612
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,400
I failed to protect you.

613
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,120
I failed to protect His Majesty.

614
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,219
Your Highness,

615
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,500
it's getting late.

616
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Let me take you back to your chamber.

617
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,800
There are many matters waiting for you to settle.

618
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,680
As long as you get the Mother Talisman,

619
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,320
all the spirits in the city

620
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,650
will be at your bidding.

621
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,500
By then, taking down the Spirit-Master Kingdom

622
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,620
and killing Tushan Honghong,

623
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,520
will be no effort at all.

624
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,920
After I kill Tushan Honghong,

625
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,930
Dongfang Yuechu will naturally be yours.

626
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,730
Thank you, Spirit Lord.

627
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,800
The imperial family of the Spirit-Master Kingdom

628
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,130
belong to the same Yiqi Alliance as your Divine Flame Villa.

629
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,670
Previously, I asked you to win over the power of

630
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,130
Yiqi Alliance within the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

631
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,530
How's that coming along?

632
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,760
The critical points

633
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,340
have been taken care of.

634
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,450
Disciples of Yiqi Alliance

635
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,360
are used to killing spirits.

636
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,700
Who are they used to killing?

637
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,320
Spirit Lord, please calm down.

638
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,550
Forgive me for saying too much.

639
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,710
You did well at the last matchmaking event.

640
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,440
This time,

641
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,070
don't met me down.

642
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,460
Don't worry, Spirit Lord.

643
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,720
If it weren't for you

644
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,090
teaching the drug tester how to purify spiritual blood,

645
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,640
I wouldn't have made it to today.

646
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,650
I'll follow you to the end.

647
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,840
I will do anything for you.

648
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,760
As long as you remember.

649
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,400
There are so many spirit slaves in the Spirit-Master Kingdom

650
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,930
who are being bullied and tortured every day.

651
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,080
They have hated the human race for a long time.

652
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,650
I just have to provoke them slightly,

653
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,710
and I'll be able to use them.

654
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,800
Let's tear up the human race and Tushan.

655
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,800
And also the hatred

656
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,110
within these spirit slaves.

657
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,160
I see you've got

658
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,680
a good understanding now.

659
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,740
You're using the power of the bystanders' resentment.

660
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,070
Not only me, but for you,

661
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,390
maintaining the strong hatred of these spirits

662
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,700
can also quickly increase your cultivation.

663
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,360
When my cultivation returns to its peak,

664
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,370
together with the hatred I've absorbed,

665
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,360
the great task of unifying the six realms

666
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,070
will be achieved soon.
