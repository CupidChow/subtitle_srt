[Fox Spirit Matchmaker: Red-Moon Pact]

2
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,680
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,610
Who are you?

4
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I'm a hero

5
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,310
who can't stand by in face of injustice.

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,280
Cut the crap.

7
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,770
How are you related to Jin Renfeng?

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,480
Jin Renfeng?

9
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,990
Why'd you mention him

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,280
to dampen my spirits?

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,500
Don't bother with him.

12
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,480
Go find Honghong first.

13
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,150
Yes.

14
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,730
I'll leave this to you.

15
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,800
Finally, I've protected it.

16
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,010
Lady Fairy!

17
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,790
Lady Fairy, it's me.

18
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,760
It's me.

19
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,330
I hurt you.

20
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,800
Lady Fairy.

21
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,750
What's going on?

22
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,270
If I'm not mistaken,

23
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
the evil force in you

24
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,630
is the same force as the black fog

25
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,890
emitted by Grief Tree.

26
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,000
But how could the purest spiritual tree

27
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,800
have such an evil force?

28
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,470
If you can't tell me,

29
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,670
pretend I didn't ask.

30
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,610
I won't tell anyone about this.

31
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,900
I'll tell you.

32
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,800
For centuries,

33
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Grief Tree's been corroded by the Dark Force.

34
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,960
After investigating for years,

35
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,690
I finally found

36
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
traces of Dark Force on Jin Renfeng.

37
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,120
But what about

38
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
the Dark Force on you?

39
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,750
Grief Tree's corrosion

40
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
affects me too.

41
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,480
I just didn't expect

42
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,900
it'd be so severe this time.

43
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,600
Is this force

44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,780
related to the person you saw in your nightmare?

45
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,510
No.

46
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,050
Then who is he?

47
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,570
Just an old friend.

48
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,070
An old friend?

49
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,830
Dongfang Yuechu.

50
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,320
What are you thinking about?

51
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,750
He was just saving her.

52
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,520
He didn't say he likes her.

53
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Why torture yourself over him?

54
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,830
Who is it?

55
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,480
Lady Fairy?

56
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,450
Take off your clothes.

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,480
Why?

58
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,550
Take them off.

59
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,630
I'm your sidekick and we're different species,

60
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,700
but men and women

61
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,380
still shouldn't be intimate.

62
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,190
How can I take off my clothes?

63
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,770
What are you thinking?

64
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,530
To apply medicine?

65
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,360
I see. I thought...

66
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
You thought what?

67
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,800
Nothing.

68
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,070
Apply it.

69
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,270
Done.

70
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,930
Thank you, Lady Fairy.

71
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,610
You're welcome.

72
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,630
Rongrong's told me what you did

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,210
to counter Renfeng's ambush of Tushan this time,

74
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,610
that you were brave

75
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
and responsible.

76
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,260
Rongrong sure is perceptive.

77
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,430
I don't wanna brag,

78
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,000
but I'm not your sidekick

79
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,340
for nothing.

80
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,290
In that case, I have a task for you.

81
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,790
If it weren't for the Dongfang Blood,

82
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,190
I'd have manipulated Tushan Honghong with hatred

83
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,270
to absorb her and Grief Tree's powers

84
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
to make a body.

85
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,680
Dongfang Yuechu...

86
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,600
Hurry up.

87
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,870
Be gentle.

88
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,270
You're so slow.

89
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,240
Listen.

90
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,870
What are you looking at?

91
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,930
Even if you're not Renfeng's accomplice,

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,460
you'll still be punished.

93
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,930
Let's see...

94
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,420
Which shop should I sell you to?

95
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,110
Yaya, you're here.

96
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,900
Try our new product,

97
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,560
Blessed Meatballs.

98
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,010
Yummy.

99
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,530
There's sauce inside.

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Oh, right.

101
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,520
Do you still need a servant?

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,250
What about this big guy?

103
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,740
Stop there!

104
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,310
Over here!

105
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,200
Stop there!

106
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,740
Come on!

107
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
Stop there!

108
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,430
Come on.

109
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,730
You should keep Dinghai Rod safe.

110
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,540
You're in love with Aolai Sanshao?

111
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,420
It's not love.

112
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,730
Then what is it?

113
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,480
It's admiration.

114
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,360
Great gods are to be admired.

115
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,550
Love is shallow.

116
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,220
Forget it.

117
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,980
You won't get such things above your level.

118
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,560
Who on earth are you?

119
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,680
Honghong's received your message, Prince Lai.

120
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,270
Please head to Tushan.

121
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,700
So...

122
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,330
you're Honghong's guest?

123
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,250
Please.

124
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,220
They can give Renfeng Tushan's spirit aura

125
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,170
and know to use the dreamcatcher to deal with me.

126
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,820
Who could it be?

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,750
Honghong.

128
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,170
I've asked Prince Lai

129
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,820
to wait by Grief Tree.

130
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,630
Do you know

131
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,080
who set you up with the dreamcatcher?

132
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,030
Do you know

133
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
who I met in this nightmare?

134
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,840
Dongfang Luo.

135
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,420
How could it be him?

136
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,850
Few knew about this even back then.

137
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,410
After centuries,

138
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,070
let alone the human race,

139
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,540
even only a few

140
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,670
of Tushan's

141
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,730
older fox spirits know about it.

142
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,440
That's right.

143
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,980
Renfeng could sneak into Tushan silently

144
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,450
because he had Tushan's spirit aura.

145
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,310
How did he get the aura?

146
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,320
And the fox spell that attacked Elder...

147
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,160
You suspect...

148
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,020
the mastermind's related to Tushan?

149
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,720
Right now,

150
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,730
only one person fits the bill.

151
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,360
You suspect her?

152
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
No way.

153
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,160
Yes.

154
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,280
How could a fox spirit whose

155
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,760
body and soul were obliterated

156
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,270
do this?

157
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,530
[Tushan's former chief: Shi Ji]

158
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,150
I've been Tushan's chief

159
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,440
for centuries.

160
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,550
To think I'd be

161
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,700
forced to this plight

162
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,020
by a traitor.

163
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,310
It's your retribution.

164
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,320
Since you became chief,

165
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
you've been causing chaos.

166
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,700
Over 300 years,

167
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,240
has there been a day of peace in Tushan?

168
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,310
What do you know?

169
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,120
Everything I did

170
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,340
was for Tushan!

171
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,780
Was it for Tushan

172
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,650
or your ambition?

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,240
Tushan Honghong.

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,320
Remember this.

175
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,340
One day,

176
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,660
you'll pay the price for today's

177
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,120
reckless betrayal.

178
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
Tushan will always be mine!

179
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,710
The war between

180
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,460
Tushan and humans will now cease,

181
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,960
and I'll be

182
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,320
Tushan's protector from now on.

183
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,840
Be it her or not,

184
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,500
if they wanna harm Tushan,

185
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,630
I won't let them off.

186
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,920
Did you figure out what this is?

187
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,610
You came uninvited.

188
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,750
You must've found an anomaly.

189
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,790
It’s been years.

190
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,840
You’re still so straightforward.

191
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,240
Where's the pleasantries

192
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
to greet your old friend?

193
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,480
Cut the crap.

194
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,850
What did you see?

195
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,070
This black fog

196
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,670
looks similar to a force

197
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,090
I've seen before,

198
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,920
but it doesn't seem to be the same one.

199
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,950
Look.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,730
Grief Tree's losing its power.

201
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,660
That's right.

202
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,500
I've never seen

203
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,660
a force that can seize others' powers.

204
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,670
Who could it be?

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,270
Regardless,

206
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,240
if they manage to seize all of

207
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,760
Grief Tree's power,

208
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,030
it might affect

209
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Tushan and the six realms.

210
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,830
You've travelled a lot.

211
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Have you heard of the soul-restoration spell?

212
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,600
Soul restoration?

213
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,570
Before you came here,

214
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
I've found some clues.

215
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,900
But the person I suspect

216
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,480
had her soul obliterated

217
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,960
centuries ago.

218
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,670
Have you heard of the Life Island?

219
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,930
Life Island?

220
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,960
You mean the island

221
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,290
at the circle's border?

222
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,360
Yes.

223
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,230
Life Island contains mysterious power

224
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,500
to restore souls and revive the dead.

225
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,910
It'd make sense

226
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,140
if an islander did it.

227
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,910
But all these years,

228
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,600
Life Island's been elusive

229
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,840
and never interfered with the six realms.

230
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,000
And I heard

231
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,270
the islanders vow at birth

232
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,360
to never step out of the island.

233
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,200
This is...

234
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,230
The islanders can't get out,

235
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,750
but outsiders may be able to get in.

236
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,570
You can find out

237
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,440
by sending men to the island to check.

238
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,070
But with the current situation,

239
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,210
I doubt Grief Tree can wait that long.

240
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,630
By the way,

241
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,340
since you've raised that Dongfang kid

242
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,370
in Tushan,

243
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,700
why don't you test him out?

244
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,870
Get up.

245
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Go find that old fox who ran away.

246
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,110
It's Dongfang Yuechu's hidden weapon.

247
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,030
Go away.

248
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,240
You're a Dongfang descendant?

249
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,630
Why did Chief hide it from me?

250
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,630
Elder.

251
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,590
You're omniscient.

252
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,450
Do you know why?

253
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,690
I don't.

254
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,120
But many of Tushan's fox spirits

255
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,520
were killed by Dongfang's Divine Flame.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,110
I remember it clearly.

257
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Old fox, don't be impulsive.

258
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Let me ask you.

259
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
Were those fox spirits

260
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,990
killed by Divine Flame

261
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,350
or by me?

262
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,260
The Human-Spirit war ended centuries ago,

263
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,160
even before

264
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,070
my grandparents

265
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,250
were born.

266
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,790
Every debt has its debtor.

267
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,330
Is it fair for me

268
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,520
to take the blame?

269
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,020
Are you asking me to find your ancestors?

270
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,590
If it can help you vent your anger,

271
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,460
why not?

272
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,690
-You…
-My ancestors are all dead anyway.

273
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,860
If you can find them,

274
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,590
you can make them pay the price.

275
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,030
Right?

276
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,470
Dongfang Divine Flame is so vicious.

277
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,590
Where are you hurt?

278
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,040
Let me see.

279
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,400
To think

280
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,120
the Dark Force

281
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,710
would not only seize Grief Tree's power

282
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,900
but also use its roots as a medium

283
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,990
to attack the land.

284
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,690
It’s only the Twin Peaks now.

285
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,140
If we don't stop it soon,

286
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,560
the entire Tushan will be...

287
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,360
Honghong.

288
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,790
Oh no.

289
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,500
Grief Tree's condition is getting worse.

290
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,360
Honghong.

291
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,010
Are you really not considering Prince Lai's suggestion?

292
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,330
You agree to sacrifice Yuechu too?

293
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,830
I just think

294
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,200
Prince Lai's more objective as a bystander.

295
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,330
Yuechu's lived in Tushan for 16 years.

296
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,640
Let alone us,

297
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,050
even the little foxes love him deeply.

298
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,700
Maybe we all forgot

299
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,670
why we kept him in Tushan.

300
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Chief, you can't hesitate anymore.

301
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,200
Chief, you can’t hesitate anymore.

302
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,490
Offer the sacrifice.

303
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,960
Only pure Dongfang Blood

304
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,640
can suppress the vicious Dark Force

305
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,160
to save Grief Tree

306
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,600
and Tushan.

307
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,870
You know Yuechu's identity?

308
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,530
Chief.

309
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,550
If I hadn't

310
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,460
found out the truth from Fu Kui,

311
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,640
how long were you gonna keep it from me?

312
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,710
I will consider it myself.

313
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
It's the last resort.

314
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,790
I won't give up trying other ways.

315
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,000
Come on!

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,720
Stop there!

317
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,410
Return me my wine!

318
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,310
-Ouch!
-You imp! Come on!

319
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,480
Listen up.

320
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,340
When I was young,

321
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,200
everyone knew how formidable

322
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
I am.

323
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,750
It's easy to deal with small fry

324
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,880
like you.

325
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,440
Jiaojiao, you're so brave.

326
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,010
What did you call me?

327
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,550
Your name wasn't Tushan Buzui originally,

328
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,640
but Tushan Jiaojiao.

329
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,820
Don't blame me for being cruel.

330
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
I have

331
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,540
no choice.

332
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,070
For Tushan,

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,920
I'd have to give up

334
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,930
even my own life.

335
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,880
From now on,

336
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,290
I'll be a vegetarian for life

337
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,130
and accumulate merits for you.

338
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,830
Brat.

339
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,890
Tushan's raised you for 16 years.

340
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,140
It's time to contribute for Tushan.

341
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,250
He has spiritual blood.

342
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
This is his destiny.

343
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,830
He wouldn't be implicated

344
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,760
if not for the evil scheme.

345
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,880
That makes sense.

346
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,030
Then

347
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,440
what should we do?

348
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,000
It's Dongfang Blood.

349
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,310
Tushan Honghong's sacrificing it?

350
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,810
I can't fail!

351
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,200
Five-Yao Death Formation?

352
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,000
You're trying to kill me.

353
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,390
Renfeng's severely injured.

354
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,570
Why don't we work together

355
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,850
to take him out of Divine Flame Villa?

356
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,440
Once we arrest him,

357
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,360
we can follow the clues

358
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,920
to find the mastermind.

359
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,140
But if Yiqi Alliance is alerted,

360
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,000
it will be

361
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,460
catastrophic for Tushan.

362
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,670
Lady... Fairy.

363
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,690
That was close.

364
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,450
If the sacrificial formation hadn't been interrupted,

365
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,580
centuries worth of planning

366
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,840
might've been ruined by Dongfang Blood.

367
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,480
Tushan Honghong.

368
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,250
At this point,

369
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,470
how can you dream about protecting everyone with benevolence?

370
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,400
Ridiculous.

371
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,070
[Tushan's mini pavilion]

372
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,250
Honghong.

373
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,970
Luckily, it's just external injuries.

374
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,430
But I'd better send someone to the leech clan

375
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,460
to ask Cui Yuling

376
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,890
to treat him thoroughly.

377
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,960
Okay.

378
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
How's Yuechu?

379
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,180
He's fine now.

380
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,350
Chief.

381
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,490
Let’s go check out Grief Tree.

382
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,510
I just checked the tree

383
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,680
and found

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,340
it's losing its power faster.

385
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,840
Right now,

386
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,070
we can only reforge the tree's heart

387
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,240
for it to survive.

388
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,810
Forge a heart...

389
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,530
Humans need a heart to live.

390
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,960
Trees too.

391
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,310
That's true.

392
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,770
But it's not easy to reforge Grief Tree's heart.

393
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,930
Any good ideas?

394
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,370
Spirit bone.

395
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,110
Grief Tree's a spiritual being nurtured by Heaven and Earth.

396
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,970
The spirit bone of Tushan's chief

397
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,750
can transform everything into spiritual beings.

398
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,720
Even so,

399
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,220
you can't sacrifice your spirit bone

400
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,880
to reforge the tree's heart.

401
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,010
Why not?

402
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,590
Chief, you should know

403
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,560
that doing this

404
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,040
would bind your life

405
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,560
to this Grief Tree.

406
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,610
When it withers,

407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,660
your soul will be obliterated

408
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,010
and you'll die with it.

409
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Grief Tree

410
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,890
will not wither.

411
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,480
If you're decided,

412
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,110
I won't stop you.

413
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,000
But you'll need

414
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,880
to be more careful

415
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,510
and care for the Love Seed in your body.

416
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,830
You mean the power of a fox spirit comes from love?

417
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,200
That's right.

418
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,680
As the chief of Tushan,

419
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,620
you have the only Love Seed in the six realms.

420
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,520
You can connect with Grief Tree,

421
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,070
where lovers pray for bonds,

422
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,730
and transform their emotions

423
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,710
into love.

424
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,670
Without your spirit bone,

425
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,600
this Love Seed

426
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,620
is your last life support.

427
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,570
I understand.

428
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,830
Is he so important to you?

429
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,790
To protect him,

430
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
you'd even give up your spirit bone.

431
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,790
This is my mission.

432
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,410
It's dangerous to remove the spirit bone,

433
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,540
but I can still live.

434
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,190
If Yuechu gives his Dongfang Blood to the tree,

435
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,880
he will die.

436
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,960
Since there is a way out,

437
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,070
why choose death?

438
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,590
Why?

439
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,970
I've lived in Tushan for 16 years.

440
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,530
How could he try to kill me?

441
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,030
A human?

442
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,790
I've long heard there's a human in Tushan.

443
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,070
So it's him.

444
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:23,850
Let's go

445
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,530
take a look.

446
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,480
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Feng]
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Li]

447
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,430
My name is Feng.
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Feng]
[Twin Peaks' flower spirit: Li]

448
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,480
My name is Feng.

449
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Her name is Li.

450
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,270
What’s your name?

451
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm asking you!

452
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,610
Are you the flower spirits who live in Twin Peaks?

453
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,350
What?

454
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,660
First time picking honey?

455
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
So what?

456
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,230
Don't look down on spirits.

457
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,640
We are both 50 years old.

458
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,360
Right?

459
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
Yes, we're 50.

460
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,160
So?

461
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,790
So in terms of age, you should speak formally to us.

462
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,050
Respect us and obey us.

463
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,150
Aren't you afraid of humans?

464
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,070
What's there to be afraid of?

465
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,610
You don't have more limbs than us,

466
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,090
nor do you fly as fast as us.

467
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,200
That's right.

468
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,350
But humans are evil and cunning,

469
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,280
using magic tools to deal with spirits.

470
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,500
Don't scare us.

471
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,600
What are you doing?

472
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,960
Chief, there’s a bad guy here.

473
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,830
You two go back first.

474
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,300
-Yes.
-Yes.

475
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,160
How is your injury?

476
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,440
Still resenting Elder?

477
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,680
I'm not.

478
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,000
I only blame myself...

479
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,440
for spending 16 years in Tushan.

480
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,270
At first, I was aware I'm a human

481
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
who's unlike you.

482
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,310
But as time passed,

483
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,350
I forgot that.

484
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,400
Elder made me come to my senses.

485
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I'm an outsider,

486
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,200
a human,

487
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
a Dongfang descendant you detest.

488
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,310
So,

489
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,860
you purposely scared those two flower spirits?

490
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,490
I didn't mean to.

491
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,570
I'm quite close with everyone.

492
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,880
But...

493
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,870
As Elder took you as a villain,

494
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,540
you feel wronged.

495
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,640
So,

496
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,360
you really think of yourself as a villain.

497
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,620
It's not up to others

498
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,000
who you are.

499
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,290
Are you Dongfang Yuechu?

500
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,870
What kind of person are you?

501
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,000
It's all up to you.

502
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,010
It's nothing to do

503
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,600
with your background and what others say.

504
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,910
Next time you see Feng and Li,

505
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,750
apologize to them.

506
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:03,870
Let me

507
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,180
take you somewhere.

508
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,880
This is Tushan's

509
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,540
Forbidden Forest.

510
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,930
So high!

511
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,840
A human's here!

512
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,780
A human.

513
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,160
Ni.

514
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,280
Come here.

515
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,110
His name is Yuechu,

516
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,520
a human who grew up in Tushan.

517
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,940
He won't hurt you.

518
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,310
Go play.

519
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Let's go play!

520
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,590
Their parents

521
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,660
were killed by humans

522
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,010
in the Human-Spirit War

523
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:27,920
centuries ago,

524
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,850
or in the recent conflicts

525
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,690
outside of Tushan.

526
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,830
Most of them

527
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,440
were killed by the Dongfangs.

528
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,050
It'll take a while for them

529
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,840
to get over their hatred towards humans

530
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,430
and the Dongfangs.

531
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,220
I can understand that hatred.

532
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,540
All these years,

533
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,470
has Tushan been secretly adopting these little spirits?

534
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,260
After the Human-Spirit War,

535
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,350
Tushan's been

536
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,350
staying out

537
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,680
of conflicts between humans and spirits.

538
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,500
We can only adopt these orphans in secret

539
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,770
and keep them here.

540
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,090
When they grow up,

541
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,160
they can decide where to go.

542
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,650
No wonder Tushan's so hard up.

543
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,080
It's because of the many adoptions.

544
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,360
Are you still mad at Elder?

545
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,720
I won't

546
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,910
call Rongrong stingy again.

547
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,650
I want to make more money for Tushan

548
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
so that these

549
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,570
parentless kids like me

550
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,550
can live a good life.

551
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,240
I hope there'll be

552
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,920
no hostility between

553
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,570
humans and spirits,

554
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,770
such that all children

555
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,700
can grow up freely and happily

556
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,470
with their parents,

557
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,050
and not be separated because of the ambition

558
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,550
of a select few.

559
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,050
[Tushan's Academy]

560
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,920
You want me to guard Tushan for you?

561
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,030
Yes.

562
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,250
I'll be cultivating in seclusion for a few days.

563
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,780
I can't take care of Tushan.

564
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,270
Luckily, your injury's almost healed.

565
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,340
You can divide the work with Rongrong.

566
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,480
Remember, always think twice.

567
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,610
Honghong, don't worry.

568
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,920
I'm Tushan's deputy chief after all.

569
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,010
I'll take good care of

570
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,790
Rongrong and other foxes.

571
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,440
If there's any problem, ask Lai for help.

572
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,920
By the way,

573
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,000
I heard that the white fox you picked up

574
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,110
is asking around about Lai.

575
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,480
What?

576
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,060
I'll teach Guoguo

577
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,540
a lesson when I get back.

578
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,440
Aren't you curious?

579
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,630
I am.

580
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,280
But you've always been cautious.

581
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,690
If you want to hide his identity,

582
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,130
I won’t ask.

583
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,190
Chief.

584
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,350
Deputy Chief.

585
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,080
Hello, Prince Lai.

586
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,520
Prince Lai, this way, please.

587
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,820
Are you okay today?

588
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,960
As they say, an exchange of blows lead to friendship.

589
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,670
It was all just a misunderstanding.

590
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,320
You're Honghong's good friend,

591
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,920
so you're my good friend too.

592
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,430
All right, you may leave.

593
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,940
I have something to discuss with Lai.

594
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,760
Okay.

595
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Your sister's really interesting.

596
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,620
Please don't tell her

597
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
I'm removing my spirit bone.

598
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,400
Why?

599
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,290
Among us three sisters,

600
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,170
Yaya's the most carefree one.

601
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,470
I don't want these things to affect her.

602
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,210
But why do I think

603
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,150
a carefree woman like her

604
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,880
shouldn't just be sheltered?

605
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Just a suggestion.

606
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
It's all up to you.

607
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,070
By the way,

608
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,440
how's the preparation for removing your spirit bone?

609
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,670
Are you troubled?

610
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,280
No.

611
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,670
Don't lie.

612
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm not.

613
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,950
Come on. Tell me.

614
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,620
Let me ask you.

615
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,450
What do you think of me?

616
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,330
Not bad.

617
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,290
Affectionate and loyal.

618
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,070
What about other humans?

619
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,070
Suddenly?

620
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,670
You hate humans, don't you?

621
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,710
Yes.

622
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,130
But it's not just me.

623
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,630
Every spirit in Tushan

624
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,070
hates humans.

625
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,970
Besides,

626
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,170
no humans like spirits too.

627
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,320
Do you believe

628
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,540
there'll come a day

629
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,090
when humans and spirits are friends?

630
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,220
Are you drunk?

631
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,810
How many fingers do you see?

632
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,830
Just go drink your wine.

633
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I need alone time.

634
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,400
I'm leaving.

635
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,480
Thank you.

636
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,320
Good wine.

637
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Humans and spirits coexisting in harmony.

638
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,440
Prince Lai.

639
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,600
Please wait here.

640
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,980
I’ll go investigate.

641
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,740
Aolai Sanshao was born from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?

642
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,070
He can turn air into mountains and tears into seas?

643
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,590
What a pack of lies.

644
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,230
Mountains existed before Sanshao was born.

645
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,800
Also,

646
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,180
Sanshao does live by the sea,

647
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,540
but it doesn't mean he created it.

648
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,770
You don't understand.

649
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,320
Think about it.

650
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,440
Except Honghong,

651
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,720
Sanshao's the most powerful being in the world.

652
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,280
With one wave of his Dinghai Rod,

653
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,880
he can draw a circular boundary

654
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,160
to protect all lives,

655
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,690
including humans.

656
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,030
Why can't a hero like him

657
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,000
summon the wind and rain

658
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,590
to create seas and mountains?

659
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,860
He’s not some hero.

660
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,080
You think too highly of him.

661
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,360
If he knew

662
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,230
drawing that boundary

663
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,830
would use up so much of his power,

664
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,000
he'd reconsider it.

665
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,550
Nonsense!

666
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,610
A small fry like you

667
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,960
can't fathom the level

668
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,780
he's at.

669
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,680
It's not nonsense.

670
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,400
As a kid,

671
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,280
he fell off clouds often.

672
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,050
You...

673
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,720
Let me tell you.

674
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,370
I hate people like you who slander others.

675
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,510
Are you jealous of him?

676
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,610
Come on.

677
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,360
Where's your conscience?

678
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,650
How dare you

679
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,190
slander a great god?

680
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,640
I really know a lot about Sanshao's true colors.

681
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,320
Go away.

682
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,010
Keep your distance from me.

683
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,920
Sanshao

684
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,180
actually has such a supporter.

685
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,200
Old Fox?

686
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,880
Old Fox.

687
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,930
Jiaojiao?

688
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,990
The heavens let me run into you tonight.

689
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,730
I don't blame you because you had a reason

690
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,660
for what you did,

691
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,320
but I have to vent my anger.

692
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,910
No way. I didn't even touch you.

693
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:55,990
Why are you crying?

694
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,280
Don't tell me it's because

695
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,900
you failed to kill me?

696
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,100
You know nothing.

697
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,150
I feel sorry for Chief.

698
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,000
Lady Fairy?

699
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,850
What's wrong with her?

700
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,880
Tell me!

701
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,150
Tomorrow morning, she'll remove her spirit bone

702
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:30,380
to reforge the Grief Tree's heart.

703
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,920
Remove her spirit bone

704
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,370
to reforge the Grief Tree's heart?
