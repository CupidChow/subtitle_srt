00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,740
[Episode 10]

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,600
You...

5
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,410
It's you.

6
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,750
I've planted the Mother Talisman in your body.

7
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,680
If you dare escape again,

8
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,440
I will burn the Mother Talisman

9
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,060
and make you

10
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,920
die a painful death.

11
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,120
No.

12
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,150
No...

13
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,120
No...

14
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,150
It's not true.

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
I must be dreaming.

16
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,120
I'm dreaming.

17
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,310
Dreaming?

18
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,630
True.

19
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,320
This place

20
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,530
is my nightmare.

21
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,910
All these years,

22
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,530
I still haven't

23
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,540
let it go.

24
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,570
Because you...

25
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,800
are still alive.

26
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,530
Help...

27
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,310
Help!

28
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,960
Help!

29
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,800
Help!

30
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,040
No.

31
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,450
No...

32
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,280
What are you doing?

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,690
Don't... Don't... Don't!

34
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,310
Useless!

35
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,000
Spirit Lord, calm down.

36
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,260
We have tried our best.

37
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,720
But rumours are spreading all over the city

38
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,390
that the Mother Talisman has been taken back by the Princess.

39
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,720
No spirit dares to leave the city anymore.

40
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,600
Spirit Lord,

41
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,870
has our talisman

42
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,730
been taken back by the human race?

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,570
Get lost!

44
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

45
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,750
He hasn't go meet Chi Shan yet...

46
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,640
This is the divine power in Xu Yi's body.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,830
He's dead?

48
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,560
Darn it.

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,420
Not enough...

50
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,120
Damned humans...

51
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,810
With only Xu Yi dead

52
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,800
is far from enough.

53
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,600
Here, take the medicine.

54
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,550
This medicine is too bitter.

55
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,870
No one in the Spirit-Master Kingdom raises chicken.

56
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,870
I painstakingly captured this from outside the city.

57
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,060
I added natural spices and honey.

58
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
It must be delicious.

59
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,510
It smells so good.

60
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,630
Half a bowl.

61
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,330
No.

62
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,270
Who would have thought

63
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,070
the top spirit in the six realms Tushan Honghong

64
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,360
is afraid of taking medicine.

65
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
How funny.

66
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,610
The chicken smells so good. Even I want to try it.

67
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,580
All right.

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,310
Did you see Shi Kuan on your way back?

69
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,540
Yes.

70
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,480
Princess chased him away.

71
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
But he was reluctant

72
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,540
so he could only wander around here.

73
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,230
I thought of what Bu Tai asked us to do.

74
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,940
If we don't solve this,

75
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,930
she and Shi Kuan can't be together.

76
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,240
The crisis of the Spirit-Master Kingdom can't be solved either.

77
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,630
The spirits in Spirit-Master Kingdom

78
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,600
have been bullied by the human race for hundreds of years.

79
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,740
If the Mother Talisman

80
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,500
can be unbound one day,

81
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,320
it's difficult to tell what will happen next.

82
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,090
It would be great if the spirits'

83
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,420
actions and words can be restricted like in Tushan.

84
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,260
Actually, I've thought about this long ago.

85
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
I want to unite the spirit clan

86
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,010
like Yiqi Alliance.

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,540
That can be a long-term plan.

88
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,430
Staying in Tushan for just a few days,

89
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,310
you've forgotten who you are?

90
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,740
I dare not.

91
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,750
I was seriously injured

92
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,630
and was hunted down by Xu Yi's men.

93
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,070
If you hadn't saved me,

94
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,430
I would have been killed by the human clan.

95
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,580
I will never forget

96
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,090
your kindness.

97
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,360
Is this how you repay me?

98
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,000
I ordered you to stay in Tushan

99
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,890
to cooperate with Chi Shan.

100
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,600
How dare you come to the Spirit-Master Kingdom and ruin my plan on your own accord?

101
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,540
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

102
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,860
I know... you won't kill me.

103
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,440
I...

104
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,240
know that the Mother Talisman was stolen.

105
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,309
I have a strategy.

106
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,760
You have a strategy?

107
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,270
Go ahead.

108
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,470
Normal spirits would be of no use

109
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
no matter how many of them come to us.

110
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,110
Why don't we fight to make

111
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,710
some powerful spirits to be used by us?

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
Rise.

113
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,620
Since you've come up with this idea,

114
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,080
you must have a candidate.

115
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,840
Tell me about it.

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,670
Last night,

117
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,290
Shi Kuan who saved Bu Tai

118
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,060
has amazing spirit power.

119
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,480
I heard he is the top warrior of Beishan.

120
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,880
He's the most powerful spirit in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

121
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,780
[Spirit-Master Kingdom]

122
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,220
Shi Kuan.

123
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,240
You are?

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Spirit Lord.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,750
You look dull

126
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,840
but you are quite agile.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
If I were Princess,

128
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,750
I wouldn't want to kick you out.

129
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
What do you want?

130
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
Don't be nervous.

131
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,430
Now you should know

132
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,550
the human race will never

133
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,100
treat spirits as their own.

134
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Instead of being a slave to the human race for your whole life,

135
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,380
why don't you come with me to save your own people

136
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,030
and overthrow Spirit-Master Kingdom?

137
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,870
Dream on!

138
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,460
If you really care about the spirits,

139
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,990
you should unbind the Mother Talisman for us

140
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,290
and solve this crisis peacefully.

141
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Why are you in a hurry to refuse?

142
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,420
With your ability,

143
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,480
if you work with me,

144
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,400
you will achieve great things.

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,710
Don't you like the Princess?

146
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,280
By then,

147
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,470
you will no longer a slave,

148
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,910
and she will no longer be a princess.

149
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,000
Your status will be above her.

150
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,200
Wouldn't it easy to get her?

151
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,270
Do you want to be a master

152
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,450
or a slave?

153
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,090
Whether you can be with the woman you love

154
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,630
depends on you.

155
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,270
I

156
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,980
won't betray the Princess.

157
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,710
Then you're forcing me to do it the hard way.

158
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,710
What a righteous warrior.

159
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,920
Since you are not willing to hurt your people,

160
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,560
how can you watch your people

161
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,180
be bullied by the human race?

162
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,650
If you work with me,

163
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,040
you can protect your people

164
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,470
and get your beauty.

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,240
Why not?

166
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,960
I

167
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,510
will never

168
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,600
betray Princess!

169
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,000
I always cherish talents.

170
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,660
I won't burn your Mother Talisman for the time being.

171
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,730
Go back and think about it.

172
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,960
I’m waiting for your answer.

173
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,010
You kicked Guard Shi out.

174
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,000
I’m worried that he’ll join the evil spirits

175
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,390
and betray you.

176
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,890
If so,

177
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,880
it would be better.

178
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,080
Princess.

179
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,010
In that case,

180
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,020
he won't be in danger anymore.

181
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,040
How dare you, spirit slave!

182
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,080
How dare you hurt the disciples of Yiqi Alliance?

183
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,610
Jin Mian Flame Immortal...

184
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,290
It’s Jin Mian Flame Immortal!

185
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,240
Greetings, Jin Mian Flame Immortal.

186
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
Thank you for saving my life.

187
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,270
You’re welcome.

188
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,190
I'm from the same alliance as you.

189
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,010
We should help each other.

190
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,200
I heard that the spirit slaves of the Spirit-Master Kingdom rebelled

191
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,750
and killed Elder Xu.

192
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,330
So I came here to help.

193
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
Good timing, Master Jin.

194
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,330
After Elder Xu died,

195
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,220
the disciples lost their leader.

196
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
We don't know what to do.

197
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,980
For ordinary humans,

198
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,400
it takes at least three to five years

199
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,460
for the cultivation of this magic for it to take effect.

200
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
How can we improve humans' defense

201
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,480
in a short time?

202
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Mr. Yuechu.

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,210
What can I do for you?

204
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,270
I heard that

205
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,390
spirit slaves attacked disciples of Yiqi Alliance outside the city.

206
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,670
Now that Chief is not around,

207
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,890
I would like to ask you

208
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,440
to go to the scene with me to find out the truth.

209
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,120
All disciples of the Yiqi Alliance have cultivation

210
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,400
and have magic tools.

211
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,610
Why are the spirit slaves from the city suddenly so bold?

212
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,680
I also think it's strange.

213
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,720
I'll go with you.

214
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
It's Spirit Lord.

215
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,000
She came to me last night

216
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,000
and forced me to work with her.

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,260
I wanted to reject her,

218
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,440
but I'm afraid she'll harm the princess

219
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,500
and harm the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

220
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,990
After thinking about it,

221
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,380
I can only discuss it with you.

222
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,750
Are you worried

223
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,550
she'll threaten you with Princess's life?

224
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,670
Princess is with Yaya and Lai.

225
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
You can rest assured.

226
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
On the other hand.

227
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,310
they have your Mother Talisman.

228
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,850
Don’t worry, Chief.

229
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,570
I will never betray Princess

230
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,960
even if it costs my life.

231
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,960
I know you are loyal to her.

232
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,630
But now loyalty

233
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
can't protect the princess,

234
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,630
nor your people.

235
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,520
Princess.

236
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,990
Since the Mother Talisman was stolen,

237
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,650
the human race in the city dared not go out again,

238
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,280
afraid of getting revenge by the spirits.

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,150
That's true...

240
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,330
Although half of the talismans were retrieved,

241
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,570
we can't use them to

242
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,960
force the spirits in the city

243
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,800
to fight against spirits outside the city

244
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,460
and make them kill each other.

245
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,420
So the current situation

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,550
is not optimistic.

247
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,910
I want to hunt spirits!

248
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,240
I want to catch spirits!

249
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,200
Come in!

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,030
I want to hunt spirits!

251
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,360
I want to catch spirits!

252
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,600
I want to hunt spirits!

253
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,720
Stop shouting!

254
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,650
If humans

255
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
have magical tools that are sufficient to fight against spirits...

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,510
Humans and spirits can be at a level playing field.

257
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,770
Not everyone can cultivate magic tools.

258
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,030
Not even all of the disciples of Yiqi Alliance

259
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,670
have a magic tool.

260
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,280
How can we shorten the time to cultivate it?

261
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
A letter from the human race.

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,320
The spirit slaves outside the city who attacked the disciples of Yiqi Alliance

263
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,570
is Jin Renfeng's doing.

264
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,360
Fu Cheng?

265
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,750
The spirits who attacked the Yiqi Alliance in the city

266
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,390
were arranged by Jin Renfeng.

267
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,240
The master of Divine Flame Villa?

268
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,370
Why would he do that?

269
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,510
What master?

270
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,510
He’s just an ungrateful traitor.

271
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,050
I didn't expect him to win over Yiqi Alliance disciples' hearts

272
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,930
in such a despicable way.

273
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:39,550
It seems

274
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,720
it's time for Wangquan Villa

275
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,780
to know about this.

276
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,600
You mean

277
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,570
you want me to join forces with

278
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,080
the spirits whose talismans were stolen

279
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,630
to guard Spirit-Master Kingdom together.

280
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,390
I know

281
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,650
you have a great reputation among the spirits in the city.

282
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,770
They will believe you.

283
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,119
Protecting the Spirit-Master Kingdom is protecting themselves.

284
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,380
Otherwise, given what Spirit Lord would do,

285
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
once Spirit-Master Kingdom falls,

286
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,790
it will be a catastrophe for both

287
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,420
the humans and spirits.

288
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,859
If I can make a magic tool,

289
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,349
the evil spirits won't be of any threat.

290
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,480
With the magic tool,

291
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,000
the human race can not only protect themselves,

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,100
but also help you

293
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,440
to fight against the evil spirits from Spirit-Master Kingdom.

294
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
After we defeat these evil spirits,

295
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,630
Kuan and you

296
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,830
can be together.

297
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,450
Do you think

298
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,610
that day will come?

299
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,550
Yes.

300
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
Everyone is working hard.

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Including Kuan.

302
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,110
I believe

303
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,910
he is the one who hopes that

304
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,170
humans and spirits can live in harmony the most in Spirit-Master Kingdom.

305
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,410
Kuan is here.

306
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,680
Mr. Yuechu.

307
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,280
Princess.

308
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,880
Where is Lady Fairy?

309
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,110
She's at the gate tower.

310
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,560
I shan't disturb you.

311
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,480
I shall go look for her.

312
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,030
Goodbye.

313
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,530
Princess.

314
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,920
I will send you back.

315
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,720
I hope Princess Bu Tai won't push Shi Kuan away anymore.

316
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,960
No matter how much she wants to keep a distance,

317
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,890
Shi Kuan still loves her very much.

318
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,030
Sometimes,

319
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,680
exactly because you love each other too much,

320
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,260
you'd do everything to protect them

321
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,010
so that they won't get hurt.

322
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,890
Are you the same?

323
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,070
Nothing.

324
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,590
Lady Fairy.

325
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,920
This time,

326
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,480
we saw the sunset of the Spirit-Master Kingdom together.

327
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,830
Next time, let's go to the peak of a snow mountain together,

328
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,790
as well as forest as dense as sea,

329
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,830
rivers that reflect the bright moon,

330
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,830
and many beautiful sceneries in the world.

331
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,070
Let's go and see them together.

332
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,550
Okay?

333
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,830
You've always been talking about this wish since you were a child.

334
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,090
Aren't you tired of it?

335
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,530
That was when I was young.

336
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,070
When I first met you,

337
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,410
I tried everything

338
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,600
to chum up to you.

339
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,350
I was afraid that I would be

340
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,180
eaten by a spirit like you.

341
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,790
Although I said this all the time back then,

342
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,250
I didn't actually mean it.

343
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,900
No wonder Elder always says you are cunning.

344
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,720
You finally admit it.

345
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,420
You're double-faced

346
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,610
and honey-lipped.

347
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,500
I told you that was when I was young.

348
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,340
What about now?

349
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,070
Now?

350
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm saying it sincerely now.

351
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,310
Lady Fairy,

352
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,980
I want to spend four seasons with you,

353
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,410
in the shadows of the mountains,

354
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,470
watching the moon.

355
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,310
You just said

356
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
you thought of a way to protect the human race.

357
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,080
What is it?

358
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,720
To make magic tools

359
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,840
for ordinary people with no cultivation to defend themselves.

360
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,450
My mother once said

361
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,770
Purest Sun Flame changes endlessly.

362
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,370
Besides transforming power

363
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,680
to refine the magic to control the Divine Fire,

364
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,510
it can also transmute ordinary weapons

365
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,510
into magic tools.

366
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,050
If Purest Sun Flame

367
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,640
can reduce the difficulty of making magic tools,

368
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
the human race of the Spirit-Master Kingdom

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,530
can also protect themselves after Mother Talisman is unbound.

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,300
What your mother said is true.

371
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,710
I once saw someone from the Dongfang family

372
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,300
make a magic tool with Purest Sun Flame.

373
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,240
But that person's Purest Sun Flame

374
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,940
was already at the third tier.

375
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,680
In that case,

376
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,790
whether the human race can protect themselves in Spirit-Master Kingdom

377
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,070
is now on me, Dongfang Yuechu.

378
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,450
Now,

379
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,100
I finally know how quickly people can change when things haven't.

380
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,130
A month ago,

381
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,510
you,

382
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,680
me,

383
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,080
and my father

384
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,120
were enjoying the flowers here together.

385
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,540
But now this place is so unfamiliar.

386
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,310
Now outside the palace,

387
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,880
the evil spirits are putting pressure on everything,

388
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,480
and humans and spirits are killing each other.

389
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,510
Please wait a little longer, Princess.

390
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,440
Everything will eventually pass.

391
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,690
What about you?

392
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,400
The Spirit Lord has her eyes on you.

393
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,680
You escaped this time.

394
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,800
But there will be a next time.

395
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,200
As long as you are fine,

396
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:08,780
I

397
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,040
won't be afraid of death.

398
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,350
Don't say that!

399
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,340
So many people and spirits have died in Spirit-Master Kingdom.

400
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,710
The rest must live on.

401
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,360
Besides,

402
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,170
you are no longer my spirit guard.

403
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,880
You don't have to risk your life for me.

404
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
It's not for you,

405
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,550
but for myself.

406
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,110
In the past,

407
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,540
I only practiced martial arts

408
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,940
and protected you.

409
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,370
Now I understand.

410
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
It's not enough

411
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
to just practice martial arts well.

412
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,260
What do you mean?

413
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,320
I want to be a real warrior

414
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,010
and protect the people I want to protect.

415
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,710
Please grant my wish.

416
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,350
Since we took back half of the Mother Talisman last time,

417
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,200
the spirits in the city have been watching.

418
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,490
There are fewer spirits leaving the city.

419
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm afraid that's why Shi Ji

420
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,510
targeted Kuan.

421
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,720
No matter the reason,

422
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,790
since they have targeted Kuan,

423
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,250
they won't stop easily.

424
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,980
Unfortunately, after what happened last time,

425
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,640
these guys are very vigilant.

426
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,090
I'm afraid it's hard to steal the Mother Talisman again.

427
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,170
Now they have Shi Kuan's Mother Talisman.

428
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,790
Why don't we let Shi Kuan pretend to surrender?

429
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,190
When we fight again,

430
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,830
we'll catch her off guard.

431
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,160
-Good idea!
-Good idea!

432
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,660
I said it first.

433
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,630
I said it first.

434
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
I said it first.

435
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,130
I said it first.

436
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,920
I said it first!

437
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,380
-I was the one who said it first.
-All right, both of you shut up.

438
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,290
What do you think, Shi Kuan?

439
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,880
I agree.

440
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,100
No, I don't agree.

441
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,070
They are ruthless.

442
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,400
Xu Yi was killed immediately

443
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,950
after failing last time.

444
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,380
If you fail,

445
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,910
they won't let you go.

446
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,410
Since the first day I was bound to a Mother Talisman,

447
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,810
my fate is to obey.

448
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,050
This time the Mother Talisman fell into the hands of the evil spirits,

449
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,650
I

450
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,010
don't want to give in to the talisman anymore.

451
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,290
As for the Mother Talisman,

452
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,320
I want to return them to the spirit slaves as soon as possible.

453
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,770
You want to unbind them from the Mother Talisman?

454
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,550
In the past, I lived a carefree life

455
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,070
staying in the palace all day long.

456
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,440
All I knew was that the human race

457
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,240
controlled the spirits with the Mother Talisman.

458
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,000
But I never thought

459
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,760
the desperation and sadness of those spirits.

460
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,230
As the head of the kingdom,

461
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,340
as someone who can decide their fate,

462
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,880
I don't want to ignore these people anymore.

463
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,560
Aren't you worried that

464
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,230
once the spirits regain their freedom,

465
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,170
they may take revenge on the humans

466
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,900
who can't protect themselves?

467
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,720
I've thought about that.

468
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,800
With you and the people of Tushan to protect,

469
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,040
I think even if those spirit slaves are free,

470
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,830
they won't take revenge on the human race immediately.

471
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,110
Your decision

472
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
will be really helpful

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,460
to the current situation.

474
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,870
The power Shi Ji and Jin Renfeng have now

475
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,150
are about the same as you.

476
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,180
If one day we fight,

477
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
we can't tell who would win just yet.

478
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,430
If you unbind the Mother Talisman,

479
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,320
it will destroy

480
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,160
the morale of Shi Ji’s forces.

481
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,440
Chief, please follow me.

482
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,030
Well,

483
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,400
can you change

484
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,510
your habit of sneaking around?

485
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,700
How many times have I caught you?

486
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,030
Who's sneaking around?

487
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,580
I'm helping Yaya pick flowers to help with her sleep.

488
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,780
Stop thinking everyone's suspicious.

489
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,080
You're quite good at using human lingo.

490
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,300
Did you live with humans in the past?

491
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,720
Do you want to learn?

492
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,300
Given your talents,

493
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,270
you can also learn pretty well

494
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,050
after a few quarrels with the darned humans.

495
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
No matter

496
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,100
whether you are really out here to pick flowers or not tonight,

497
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,540
if it happens again,

498
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,890
don't blame me for taking action.

499
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,030
Excuse me.

500
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,480
A good dog doesn't block the way.

501
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,510
A good dog?

502
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,880
Hurry up!

503
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,550
Go!

504
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,810
-Do you hear that?
-Are you slacking off?

505
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,720
You're quite busy.

506
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,000
Yaya.

507
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,350
Since you entered Spirit-Master Kingdom,

508
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,720
you kept going missing.

509
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,640
What are you doing?

510
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,750
I...

511
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,530
w-was looking for you.

512
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,790
Looking for me?

513
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
What is this?

514
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,590
I know you love drinking alcohol.

515
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,440
I thought Spirit-Master Kingdom

516
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,960
is different from Tushan

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,400
so maybe the wine is different.

518
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,830
So I asked around

519
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,720
and finally found this grape wine.

520
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,180
You looked for this for me?

521
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,810
That's very nice of you.

522
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,010
Oh right,

523
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,250
the situation of Spirit-Master Kingdom is complicated.

524
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,080
Don't walk around in the dark at night.

525
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,750
If the evil spirits catch you,

526
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,610
you won't have a chance to return to Tushan anymore.

527
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,830
Understand?

528
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,550
Do you hear me?

529
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,460
What are you thinking?

530
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,510
I got it.

531
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
I'm heading off then.

532
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,800
[Spirit-Master Kingdom]

533
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,650
We're free!

534
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,370
We're free!

535
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,680
Great!

536
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,960
The news has been released?

537
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,770
Don't worry.

538
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,510
This is something that hasn't happened for centuries in Spirit-Master Kingdom.

539
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,510
Within half a day,

540
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,640
the news will definitely get to Shi Ji.

541
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,330
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

542
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,120
Who said they wanted to have their Mother Talisman unbound?

543
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,680
It's me!

544
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,240
You kept saying that the human race's Princess is horrible

545
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,720
and asked us to overthrow her.

546
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,720
But she has unbound the Mother Talisman for everyone.

547
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,920
Those who dare to escape

548
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,080
will end up like this!

549
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,020
In a few days,

550
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,230
I will take over the Spirit-Master Kingdom with you.

551
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,370
In the future, there will be no human race

552
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,210
in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

553
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,480
What is it?

554
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,440
Shi Kuan.

555
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,200
Have you thought about

556
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,400
what I mentioned to you previously?

557
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,280
I told you.

558
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,040
I would never betray Princess.

559
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,450
Should I call you a fool?

560
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Or that you're a hopeless romantic?

561
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,640
If you work with me,

562
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,030
you can have the beauty,

563
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,140
If you don't,

564
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,360
you two can only be lovers in your afterlife.

565
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,930
As expected of the top warrior of Beishan.

566
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,360
You have some guts.

567
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,930
Have you thought about it?

568
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,080
If you die,

569
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,790
what will happen to your delicate princess?

570
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,200
After invading the city,

571
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,910
I will kill her first.

572
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
If you work with me,

573
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,750
for your sake,

574
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
I will spare her life.

575
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,880
Will you keep your promise?

576
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,060
That depends on how useful you are to me.

577
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,930
I heard that you've been

578
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,070
quite close to the spirit slaves in the city recently.

579
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,300
Help me draw them over.

580
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,480
When we invade the city,

581
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,480
you will be my vanguard of the city.

582
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,010
Remember,

583
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,520
I have your Mother Talisman.

584
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,660
If you dare to play any tricks,

585
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,790
I'll kill you anytime.

586
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,510
Lady Fairy.

587
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,240
This is...

588
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,520
Chicken soup.

589
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,720
There are some herbs in it.

590
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,470
Although your wound has recovered,

591
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,960
it's not a small matter that your soul is unstable.

592
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,820
It's good to have more nutrition.

593
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,440
Here.

594
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,390
How is it?

595
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,440
Not bad.

596
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,440
Why didn't I notice that you can do

597
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,040
so many other things other than roast chicken?

598
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,110
Why don't you work in the canteen in the future?

599
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,690
No.

600
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,030
Why?

601
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,900
You get paid well there.

602
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,830
That won't do too.

603
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,770
I'll only cook for you.

604
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm not interested in cooking for others.

605
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,400
Why aren't you drinking?

606
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,560
It smells so good.

607
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
I smelled it from afar.

608
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,510
It's really chicken soup.

609
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,230
Sister.

610
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,050
You must've made this for me

611
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,800
knowing that I've been so tired that

612
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,860
I've lost weight from hunger, right?

613
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,590
Brat, serve it to me.

614
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,550
Why are you still here?

615
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,100
Are you going to stay to wash the dishes?

616
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,659
No. Do it yourself.

617
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,330
Don't forget,

618
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,510
after Lady Fairy finishes it,

619
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,699
do her dishes too.

620
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,820
I don't need you to remind me that.

621
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,840
Lady Fairy,

622
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,100
I'll take my leave now.

623
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,190
Can you see me off?

624
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,020
Here.

625
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,170
This is...

626
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,000
Supper, your favorite roast chicken.

627
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,560
I wanted to give it to you after you finish the soup.

628
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,590
Don't let Yaya know.

629
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,690
I'm leaving.

630
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,510
What's going on?

631
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,320
Why does my heart suddenly feel like

632
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
it was bitten by snakes and insects?

633
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,790
Yuechu, why did you do that?

634
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,970
Do you know

635
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,670
although human breath can protect the soul,

636
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,780
as time passes,

637
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,060
the soul will consume the Qi and blood,

638
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,710
and damage the body of the person who is naturing it.

639
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,540
Could it be...

640
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,880
the soul of Dongfang Luo is starting to attack?
