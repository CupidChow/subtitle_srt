[Episode 8]

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Greetings, Spirit Lord.

5
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,470
How is it going?

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,510
I've replaced His Majesty's Mother Talisman.

7
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,640
What he gave to Bu Tai

8
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,750
is just a useless piece of paper.

9
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,960
I've planned for so long.

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,990
These spirit slaves

11
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,740
are finally in my hands.

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,190
They are under my command now.

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,780
I heard that Tushan Honghong has set off.

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,800
It's almost time she's here.

15
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,550
You and I will cooperate then

16
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,650
and give her a big gift.

17
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Yes.

18
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,790
I don’t want these things to dirty my hands.

19
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,120
Then I will

20
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,590
keep it for you.

21
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,810
In the Spirit-Master Kingdom,

22
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,580
there are 10 times more spirits than humans.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,060
Now that we have the Mother Talisman,

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,740
there will only be more spirits who leave the city to find another master.

25
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,560
When you

26
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,630
gather more than half of the spirit slaves,

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,750
it'd be easy for us

28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,300
to take down Spirit-Master Kingdom.

29
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,300
By then, we will work together from inside and outside

30
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,070
to stir up the storm in Spirit-Master Kingdom.

[Spirit-Master Kingdom]

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,530
The spirits are rebelling!

33
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,930
The spirits are killing!

34
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,160
Everyone saw

35
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,210
what happened today.

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,870
If you want to live,

37
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,250
we can only save ourselves.

38
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,820
Spirit Lord, show us a way out!

39
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,300
Yes, show us the way!

40
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,920
The spirits have spirit power to protect them

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,450
and they have longer lives.

42
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,820
They are stronger than the human race.

43
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,150
They are only forced to be slaves and humiliated

44
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,650
because of the Mother Talisman.

45
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,210
Now that I've got everyone's Mother Talisman,

46
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,310
you can let yourself free

47
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,710
and take revenge!

48
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,870
Turn the Spirit-Master Kingdom

49
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,800
into the territory of the spirits.

50
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,750
Trample over

51
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,580

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,980
Kill the human race and destroy Spirit-Master Kingdom!

53
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,240
Kill the human race and destroy Spirit-Master Kingdom!

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,420
Kill the human race and destroy Spirit-Master Kingdom!

55
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,550
Kill the human race and destroy Spirit-Master Kingdom!

56
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,060
Over hundreds of years,

57
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,250
many spirits have died in the hands of the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

58
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,230
Today

59
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,720
is the time for our revenge.

60
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
I didn't expect that despite rushing over,

61
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,710
things have already happened to Spirit-Master Kingdom.

62
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,040
We can't let the conflict continue to grow.

63
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Otherwise, the situation will continue to worsen.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,190
Okay.

65
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,909
Wait here.

66
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll be right back.

67
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,870
Cui Yuling, come and take a look.

68
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,500
This guy is very strange.

69
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,510
After he was poisoned last time,

70
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,360
he has been unconscious for days.

71
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,150
Is that so?

72
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,830
Seven-Day Sleep.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,080
What is Seven-Day Sleep?

74
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,560
It's a special poison made by Nan Kingdom.

75
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,490
The victim won't wake up till seven days have passed.

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
How a poison from Nan Kingdom

77
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,870
appear in Tushan?

78
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
The only person who knows how to make this poison

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,320
Poison Boy from Nan Kingdom.

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,920
But Lai is an important guest invited by my sister.

81
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,950
How could that have anything to do with Poison Boy from Nan Kingdom?

82
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,750
Could it be...

83
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,560
Lai was disguised by Poison Boy?

84
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,870
You harmed these spirits?

85
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,480
I poisoned them with Seven-Day Sleep.

86
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,880
You probably don't know,

87
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,830
but the spirits in Spirit-Master Kingdom

88
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,830
are controlled by the human race with Mother Talisman.

89
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,830
Mother Talisman?

90
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,240
All these years, I thought these spirits

91
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,640
volunteered to serve others.

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,100
I didn't expect there to be such a charm here.

93
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,510
I must do something.

94
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
What do you plan to do?

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,070
Tushan Honghong.

96
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,070
You must accept all these grand gifts

97
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,630
one by one.

98
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,350
It's too late.

99
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,040
What happened?

100
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Is someone

101
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,090
destroying their Mother Talisman?

102
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,010
How dare you, spirit!

103
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,150
How dare you kill the spirit of Spirit-Master Kingdom in public!

104
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,390
This is outrageous!

105
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,910
Elder,

106
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,450
you've misunderstood.

107
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,660
These spirits slaves suddenly died.

108
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,300
We were just helping them, not killing them.

109
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,440
Everyone saw you

110
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,300
killing the spirit slaves just now.

111
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
You're still denying it?

112
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,140
These spirit slaves were not poisoned

113
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,580
and were not injured by an external force.

114
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,690
There's only one possibility that they died such a tragic death,

115
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,550
that someone destroyed their Mother Talisman.

116
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,240
Nonsense!

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,710
The Mother Talisman of the spirits of Spirit-Master Kingdom

118
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,640
is in the hands of the royal family.

119
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,920
Who would dare to destroy it secretly?

120
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,380
The bodies are here.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,200
I didn't make a groundless conclusion.

122
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,750
Elder Xu,

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,290
it was indeed caused by their Mother Talisman being ruined.

124
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,390
In that case,

125
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,810
it must be because you used your spirit power

126
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,870
and destroyed their Mother Talisman.

127
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,100
Otherwise, why would this happen to so many spirit slaves

128
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,550
the moment you arrive?

129
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,960
Sounds like

130
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,390
you are determined to

131
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,970
to blame us for the death

132
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,410
of these spirit slaves.

133
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,240
Arrest these two spirits who killed the spirit slaves!

134
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
If they resist,

135
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,200
kill them immediately!

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,650
Yes!

137
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,650
Lady Fairy, why didn't you dodge?

138
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
It's to test your recent cultivation.

139
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,290
Looks like it has been useful.

140
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,570
So you've noticed me long ago.

141
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,470
How dare you!

142
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,870
Yuechu,

143
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,630
I treated you as a guest invited by the princess

144
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,350
so I gave you respect.

145
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,600
How dare you obstruct my job?

146
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,150
I dare not.

147
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,770
Elder Xu, you are just doing your job.

148
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,020
I am too.

149
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,910
I'm here to welcome Tushan's chief

150
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,540
under the order of Spirit-Master Kingdom's princess.

151
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,570
What?

152
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,430
So she's Tushan Honghong.

153
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,100
The strongest spirit.

154
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Tushan Honghong.

155
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,270
I don't care where you are a chief at.

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,100
Since you've entered the territory of the Spirit-Master Kingdom,

157
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
it's under my jurisdiction.

158
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,600
Killing spirit slaves

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,270
is unforgivable nevertheless.

160
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,000
Capture her!

161
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,270
Stop!

162
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,910
Tushan's chief is an important guest the Princess has invited.

163
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,510
Without concrete evidence,

164
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,920
it's inappropriate

165
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,350
and illegal for you to

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
capture her.

167
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,550
Elder Xu,

168
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,910
there are still a few spirit slaves who doesn't have their Mother Talisman destroyed.

169
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,200
They're just in a coma.

170
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,590
Why don't we bring them back?

171
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,370
When they wake up, the truth will be revealed.

172
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,670
Yes.

173
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,080
At this point,

174
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,400
Elder Xu, why are you still not letting her go?

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,670
Are you going to disobey the Princess's order

176
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,070
in front of the disciples of Yiqi Alliance?

177
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,010
Keep your fox tails.

178
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,080
Otherwise, don't blame me for not letting you go back.

179
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,510
Thank you for your reminder, Elder Xu.

180
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,510
Take the living spirit slaves away.

181
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,530
How did the Princess know my schedule?

182
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,860
Of course she doesn't.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,720
I was just lying

184
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,510
to scare that old man Xu.

185
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,600
I saw him taking people out of the city, so I followed him secretly.

186
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,130
I didn't expect to meet you–

187
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,770
Keep up.

188
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
Get up. Don't slack off.

189
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,470
Take him back.

190
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,010
Work properly.

191
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,200
Go!

192
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,830
Hurry up!

193
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,900
Elder Xu, watch your step.

194
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Don't slack off.

195
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,360
You're old.

196
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,670
Be careful when you walk.

197
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,030
If you fall down,

198
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,760
you won't be able to get back up.

199
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Stop pretending.

200
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,530
Get up and work!

201
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,650
Hurry up! You're asking to be beaten!

202
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,580
Your Highness,

203
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,550
we've brought Tushan Honghong and her companion.

204
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,720
Tushan's chief?

205
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,930
She came in person.

206
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,150
You didn't know?

207
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,380
Invite her in quickly.

208
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,630
Yes.

209
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,240
Don’t bother, Elder Xu.

210
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,910
Chief.

211
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,480
I’ve heard about your father.

212
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,370
My condolences, Princess.

213
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,510
Thank you, Chief.

214
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,470
How was your trip?

215
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,150
It was okay.

216
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,020
It's just that when we first arrived at the city gate,

217
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,720
we met a few spirit slaves who were rebelling.

218
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,050
Don't worry, Princess.

219
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,390
These things have been solved.

220
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,030
To avoid any accidents,

221
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,430
I’ve asked Guard Shi to oversee the prison.

222
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,600
Thank you for your kind consideration, Young Master Yuechu.

223
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
Have you ever thought about this?

224
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,120
The spirit slaves have always been obidient

225
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
because of the Mother Talisman.

226
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,680
But this time, why did they act brazenly and recklessly?

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,240
Indeed.

228
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,790
Logically, Father gave me the Mother Talisman.

229
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,320
They wouldn't dare to do so.

230
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,850
What if someone stole the Mother Talisman?

231
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,090
I just checked before you came.

232
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,570
The Mother Talisman is still there.

233
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,720
Are you sure

234
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,380
the Mother Talisman in your hand is real?

235
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,070
Darned spirit!

236
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,270
How dare you gather in public and cause chaos to the Spirit-Master Kingdom?

237
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,330
You deserve to die!

238
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:00,800
Stop!

239
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
Shi Kuan!

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,250
You are just a spirit guard.

241
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,960
How dare you interfere with my interrogation?

242
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,230
He's guilty,

243
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,380
but he needs to be interrogated first.

244
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,140
Elder Xu,

245
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
how can you punish him without permission?

246
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,950
You're protecting him so much.

247
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,980
Are you working with this spirit slave?

248
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,550
I just want to remind you.

249
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,360
Now,

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,910
Princess wants to investigate this thoroughly,

251
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,130
if you really abuse him to death,

252
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,880
it wouldn't be good.

253
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,670
Ridiculous.

254
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
I don't need to discuss with you,

255
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,890
a spirit slave , on how to do my job.

256
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,410
Shi Kuan, are you really going to rebel for this spirit slave?

257
00:15:59,170 --> 00:15:59,980
Elder Xu.

258
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,470
Her Highness summons you.

259
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,230
Greetings, Your Highness.

260
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,440
Rise, Elder Xu.

261
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,270
Why did you summon me?

262
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,030
Elder Xu.

263
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,330
My father was seriously ill a few whille ago.

264
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,600
It was thanks to you

265
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,060
and the close ministers and servants' care.

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,720
I'm very grateful. I want to draw up a reward

267
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,670
to comfort my late father.

268
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,790
You're welcome, Your Highness.

269
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,670
This is my duty.

270
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,090
You're doing your duty,

271
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,320
but the royal family can't do nothing about it.

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,000
Elder Xu, please draw up a list of

273
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,760
the people who have assisted and taken care

274
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,089
of my father for me

275
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,089
so that I can reward them one by one.

276
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:13,810
Yes.

277
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,970
Princess.

278
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,070
Thank you, Elder Xu.

279
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,490
If there's nothing else,

280
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,250
I'll take my leave.

281
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,320
Go ahead.

282
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,110
Chief.

283
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
My father has always been cautious.

284
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,590
The point of time where the Mother Talisman was stolen

285
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,590
mustn't be long before he died.

286
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
The person we're looking for

287
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
should be among them.

288
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,350
After the late emperor passed away,

289
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,720
all the ministers of the Spirit-Master Kingdom didn't agree to damaging his body.

290
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,920
I can only get this little bit in secret.

291
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,090
I thought it might work in the future.

292
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,720
No wonder Chief always protects you.

293
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,170
You are quite reliable.

294
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
Red Brave Flower.

295
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,830
This is an extremely rare poison

296
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,200
that is priceless.

297
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,370
The poisoned would have a high fever like a medical emergency

298
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,850
and die in a short time.

299
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,400
I knew it.

300
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:36,780
Here.

301
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,260
Gujin,

302
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,040
you have always been cautious.

303
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,650
What happened today?

304
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
You not only led a group of spirits to cause commotions,

305
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,210
and even wanted to kill humans.

306
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,640
If the Mother Talisman gets burned,

307
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,790
you'd be dead.

308
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,200
It's different now.

309
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,810
We're going to make a comeback

310
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,310
and teach those humans a lesson.

311
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,920
Shi Kuan,

312
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,400
listen to me.

313
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,640
A powerful female spirit

314
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,510
got our Mother Talisman.

315
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,590
She said

316
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,550
we are going to overthrow the Spirit-Master Kingdom

317
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,480
and trample over

318
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,550
the human race.

319
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,120
Impossible.

320
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Impossible?

321
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,300
Look around.

322
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,270
These days,

323
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,350
there are so many spirits who rebel.

324
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Are there any of them

325
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,670
who have been beaten, killed

326
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,270
or had their Mother Talisman burned?

327
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,270
This means

328
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,450
our Mother Talisman is no longer in the hands of the human race.

329
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,480
Shi Kuan.

330
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,330
Join us.

331
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,670
You were born with divine power.

332
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,080
Join us

333
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,880
to overthrow the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

334
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,610
and no longer be a spirit slave.

335
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,270
With your ability,

336
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
you'll be successful in the future.

337
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,960
Why are you hesitating?

338
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,080
Just for

339
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,830
the Princess of the human race?

340
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,770
The Princess and the late Emperor treated me well.

341
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,690
I can't be ungrateful.

342
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,950
Ungrateful?

343
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,600
Wake up, Shi Kuan!

344
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,590
Why did they treat you well?

345
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,310
They just want your divine power

346
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,640
for protection.

347
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,960
Once they find out

348
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,970
you are no longer used by them,

349
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,160
they would be heartless

350
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,770
when they turn around to deal with you.

351
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,570
What about the female spirit you mentioned?

352
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,210
How do you know

353
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,280
she's not using you?

354
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,030
Princess.

355
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,960
Kuan,

356
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,760
are you hiding something from me?

357
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,160
Are you afraid that I will punish Gujin?

358
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,720
Will you punish him?

359
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,400
You wouldn't worry about this in the past.

360
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,790
Have I changed

361
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,000
in your heart?

362
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,100
You are no longer just a princess.

363
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,040
You are the Master of Spirit-Master Kingdom.

364
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,550
Be it the Princess or the Master,

365
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,350
it makes no difference between us.

366
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,790
What changed

367
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,710
is the relationship between

368
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,470
human race and spirit clan.

369
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm a human, you're a spirit.

370
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,370
If a dispute happens between the two,

371
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,720
what will you do?

372
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,070
I will always be your spirit guard.

373
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,400
From the first sight I saw you,

374
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,810
I swore to protect you forever.

375
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,100
No matter what happens between humans and spirits,

376
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,220
I will never... change my mind.

377
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,720
Kuan,

378
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,550
do you know

379
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,440
my father

380
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,580
was poisoned?

381
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,330
Princess...

382
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,440
The reason why Gujin are fearless

383
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,370
is because someone killed Father

384
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,250
to steal Mother Talisman.

385
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,590
Please rest assured, Princess.

386
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,350
No matter there is a Mother Talisman or not,

387
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,960
I

388
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
will protect the princess forever.

389
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,550
Kuan,

390
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,710
I only have you now.

391
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,760
Princess.

392
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,970
No.

393
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,310
It's getting late.

394
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,230
Send me back.

395
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,310
First, they put a spy

396
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,270
by the Emperor's side to poison him.

397
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,680
Then, they switched the Mother Talisman

398
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,790
without anyone knowing

399
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,190
and encouraged the spirit slaves to rebel.

400
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,790
The female spirit behind this

401
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,550
has amazing

402
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,920
ambitions and plans.

403
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Using Dark Force to deal with Tushan,

404
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,310
naturally, this person has evil intentions.

405
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,590
That's very evil.

406
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,310
This female spirit is saying that she will free the spirit slaves.

407
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,160
Yet till now,

408
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,790
she still hasn't removed the Mother Talisman for them.

409
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,510
Instead, she kept trying to get

410
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,510
even more spirit slaves on her side.

411
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,800
What does that mean?

412
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,680
You mean

413
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,750
she wants these spirit slaves to be controlled by her?

414
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,750
When enough spirit slaves are on her side,

415
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,830
she can become the new master of spirit slaves.

416
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,830
Then she can take the chance

417
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,590
to fuel the hatred between spirit slaves and humans

418
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,390
to realize her ulterior motive.

419
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,000
Chief,

420
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,440
could this be Shi Ji

421
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,310
which you mentioned previously?

422
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,670
No matter it's her or not,

423
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I have to meet her.

424
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,270
How?

425
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,550
Sneak in as a spirit slave.

426
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,030
Sneak in as a spirit slave?

427
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,290
That's too dangerous.

428
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,960
I agree.

429
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,280
Brat, what do you agree with?

430
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,110
Do you know that with her current cultivation,

431
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,570
if anything goes wrong...

432
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,280
No one can stop what

433
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,940
Lady Fairy wants to do.

434
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,830
Right?

435
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,790
Fine.

436
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,510
I'll risk my life to accompany you

437
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,160
and be a spirit slave with you.

438
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,030
No need.

439
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,550
The spy in the palace hasn't been found yet.

440
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,810
We still need you here.

441
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,180
Spirit-Master Kingdom

442
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,670
follows human habits.

443
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Without the magic tools of spirits,

444
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,430
will you be not used to it?

445
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,250
I'm not that delicate.

446
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,150
I lived in the wilderness in the early years.

447
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,920
In the wilderness?

448
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,370
Were you afraid?

449
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,280
Anyone but me should be afraid.

450
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,690
All right, you must be tired

451
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,590
after today.

452
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,920
Rest early.

453
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,630
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

454
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,790
Pick me up?

455
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,350
Yes.

456
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,520
I'll go to the spirit gathering place with you.

457
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,250
No need.

458
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Do you think

459
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,510
I would really let you go alone?

460
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,330
Let go.

461
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,280
No.

462
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,880
Unless you agree.

463
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,200
You cheated!

464
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,920
I've taught you since you were young:

465
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
all is fair in war.

466
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,270
I need to rest.

467
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,030
How boring.

468
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,160
Remember...

469
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,720
to come to pick me up earlier tomorrow.

470
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,410
Lady Fairy,

471
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
I look like a fox spirit now, right?

472
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,270
You do look like a male fox from Tushan.

473
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
However...

474
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,400
You still need some spirit aura.

475
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,830
Done.

476
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,960
Today,

477
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,820
our identities will be switched.

478
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,160
Switched?

479
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,490
I

480
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,410
shall be

481
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,510
Susu.

482
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,420
Brother,

483
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,240
keep up.

484
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,510
Susu,

485
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,360
be good today.

486
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,160
Good!

487
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,730
One more!

488
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,390
One more!

489
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,160
Well...

490
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,760
Bravo! Bravo!

491
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,750
Bravo!

492
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,480
Stop playing.

493
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,630
If you score again,

494
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,390
I'll lose everything.

495
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,490
Boss,

496
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,440
integrity is key in business.

497
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,890
Well...

498
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,840
Since I won the cuju game, you should give me the gift.

499
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,790
W-Well...

500
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,420
Susu,

501
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,180
what do you want this time?

502
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,210
That one.

503
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,880
Okay!

504
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,750
Get lost!

505
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:55,910
Move!

506
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,420
Move!

507
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:56,900
Move!

508
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,160
Move!

509
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,440
Look.

510
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,140
This is it?

511
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,400
Since when

512
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,010
can spirit slaves can have fun in the street?

513
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,760
What are you looking at?

514
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,080
Susu.

515
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,690
You've been the one protecting me while I was growing up.

516
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,290
This time,

517
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,960
let me protect you.

518
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,070
Let go!

519
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,590
Wait. Just you wait!

520
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,550
Just you wait!

521
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,580
You deserve it!

522
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,340
[Resistance of the human race
6.5 km outside of the city
In the depths of the desert]

523
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,050
Your plum juice is here.

524
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,660
Kuan,

525
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,510
come and have one too.

526
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:42,930
Princess.

527
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,110
Kuan,

528
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,270
you won't drink plum juice

529
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,180
with me anymore?

530
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
I don't mean that.

531
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,770
Why aren't you drinking then?

532
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm not thirsty.

533
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,360
Are you thirsty or do you dare not?

534
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,420
I'm just a spirit slave.

535
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,970
I don't deserve to drink with you.

536
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,250
Kuan,

537
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,130
I've never seen you as a spirit slave.

538
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,550
From the first sight I saw you,

539
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,010
you have always been

540
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,070
Kuan.

541
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,070
I hope you can forget who I am

542
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,520
and just think of me as Bu Tai.

543
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,720
I'm sorry.

544
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,830
Sit.

545
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,250
All these years,

546
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,160
the taste of the plum juice

547
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,310
stayed the same.

548
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,110
But I don't know why

549
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,350
as people grow,

550
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,750
they become more difficult to understand.

551
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,510
Did we change,

552
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,550
or has the distance between us changed?

553
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,390
You are a royal.

554
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,060
Now you have someone you love too.

555
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,150
I am

556
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,050
not someone who deserves your worry.

557
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,070
Kuan,

558
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
don't worry.

559
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,590
I won't punish Gujin,

560
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,159
nor will I punish those spirit slaves.

561
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,440
I know it's not their fault.

562
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,670
Princess,

563
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,280
remember your identity.

564
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,630
If others see

565
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,170
you are involved with a spirit slave,

566
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,630
there will be some unnecessary rumors.

567
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,360
What if I say I don't care?

568
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,120
Princess,

569
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,410
you're Master of the Kingdom now.

570
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,550
Chi Shan eats so much.

571
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,110
In just a few days,

572
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,760
I've received so many invoices from the restaurant.

573
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,670
Consider it a salary to them.

574
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,450
I need to go to Spirit-Master Kingdom to help Honghong.

575
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,240
Use that method to make Chi Shan and the others protect Tushan.

576
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,440
If anyone dares to make trouble,

577
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,300
they will be dealt with in no time.

578
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
That's true.

579
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,940
Speaking of which,

580
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,090
thanks to Prince Lai's Seven-Day Sleep,

581
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,220
this poison not only

582
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,210
made Chi Shan scared to cause trouble,

583
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,930
but also made them protect Tushan for us.

584
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,290
Don't mention that guy.

585
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,770
He is an evil spirit.

586
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,840
He lied to the whole Tushan pretending to be Honghong's friend.

587
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,720
When I see him,

588
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,360
I will make him pay for it!

589
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,310
Yaya,

590
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,000
let's set off.

591
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,660
Guoguo.

592
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,790
Spirit-Master Kingdom is unlike Tushan.

593
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,790
Don't run around.

594
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
If you hold me back,

595
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,950
I won't protect you.

596
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,130
Don't worry, Yaya.

597
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,330
I know what to do.

598
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,330
These days,

599
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,840
I practiced hard

600
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,600
just to perform well.

601
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,000
Really?

602
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,230
Just wait and see.

603
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,930
Lady Fairy,

604
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
the gathering place that the spirit slave in the prison mentioned

605
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,620
should be right ahead.

606
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,300
Be careful.

607
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,230
Look, this plant is called Fire Candle.

608
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,150
It's a common poisonous herb in the desert.

609
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,680
It fuses with blood easily.

610
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,330
If you accidentally touch it,

611
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,590
though it's not fatal,

612
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,710
your veins and tendons would feel like they are being burned.

613
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,440
Only by forcing the poison out can it be relieved.

614
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,840
This thing is so scary?

615
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,310
I have to stay away from it.

616
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,110
When we

617
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,590
find out the female spirit's location,

618
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,640
act accordingly,

619
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,590
and retrieve the Mother Talisman.

620
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,070
Okay.

621
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,240
Let's go.

622
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,670
Susu.

623
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,040
We can finally be free.

624
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,870
Sir.

625
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,810
I heard that our Mother Talisman

626
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,880
has been taken from the human race.

627
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,630
Is that true?

628
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,660
Where are you two from?

629
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,580
Why haven't I seen you before?

630
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,880
You have no idea.

631
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,210
Previously,

632
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,360
we've been imprisoned by our master

633
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,760
and was never allowed to go out.

634
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,700
After we

635
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,960
heard the news,

636
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,840
we did everything we could go escape.

637
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,800
That's right.

638
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,070
Our master

639
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,620
hit us a lot.

640
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,440
My brother almost died

641
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,190
trying to protect me last time.

642
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
That's right.

643
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,650
Fortunately, we got our Mother Talisman back.

644
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,280
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

645
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
That's right.

646
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,410
Which amazing spirit did that?

647
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,370
Of course.

648
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Spirit Lord said

649
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,630
when we destroy the human race,

650
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,280
Spirit-Master Kingdom will be our territory.

651
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,230
Spirit Lord?

652
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,930
Spirit Lord?

653
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,510
The two of you look obviously oblivious.

654
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,940
You don't even know who Spirit Lord is?

655
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,080
Spirit Lord's spirit power is unfathomable.

656
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,920
Even the most powerful magic tool can't do anything to her.

657
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,910
Since Spirit Lord is so powerful,

658
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,650
why isn't she returning the Mother Talisman to us?

659
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,690
Then everyone will be free.

660
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,670
In this way,

661
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,190
no one can threaten us

662
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,640
with the Mother Talisman.

663
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,440
You're right.

664
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,110
Why didn't you

665
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,630
unbind our Mother Talisman directly?

666
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,380
That's right.

667
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,050
Why?

668
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,030
That's right, it makes sense.

669
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,800
Bros,

670
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,030
do you know where the Spirit Lord is now?

671
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,290
We want to go thank her.

672
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,950
Go straight along this road and turn right.

673
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
When you reach the end

674
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,160
and see a dune,

675
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,670
she's right there at the turn.

676
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,270
Thank you.

677
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,200
Let's go.

678
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,920
They found this place so soon?

679
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
Tushan Honghong,

680
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,630
I can't wait

681
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,760
to meet you.

682
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,190
Unfortunately,

683
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,320
the number of spirit slaves who left the city are still the minority.

684
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,630
My real identity can't be exposed yet.

685
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,190
I'll let you go on for a few more days.

686
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,920
It's empty. No one's here.

687
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,540
They moved so fast.

688
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,840
Maybe

689
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,670
what we said in the crowd

690
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,420
aroused their vigilance.

691
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,960
Looks like we need to find them

692
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
in another way.

693
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,400
Maybe

694
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,550
we can start from

695
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,150
that spirit slave we caught.

696
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,420
Gujin.

697
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,550
Gujin.

698
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,410
Spirit Lord sent me to save you.

699
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,790
Come with me.

700
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,000
Next,

701
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,880
you can go out of the palace to find Spirit Lord.

702
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,320
What about you?

703
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,230
I have to stay in the palace. I have other tasks.

704
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,540
Take care.

705
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,380
Go ahead.

706
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:10,820
Thanks.

707
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:11,640
Go ahead.

708
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,710
This guy is quite vigilant.

709
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,840
We've been circling around.

710
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,130
Shadows move without any wind.

711
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,070
Appear.

712
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,210
Looks like this is their lair.

713
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,340
Shadows move without any wind.

714
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,340
Appear.
