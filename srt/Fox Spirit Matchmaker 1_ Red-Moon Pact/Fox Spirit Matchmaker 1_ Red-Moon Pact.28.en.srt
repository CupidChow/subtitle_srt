Nangong Shi for punishment.

6
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,229

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,970

to protect Yan Rushan and my love,

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,310
please bless him

Don't say anything else.

20
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,360
What kind of questions?

21
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,960
Just answer.

34
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,070
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,070
I was too stupid.

36
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,329
I never expected you to like me.

37
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,070
And I didn't realize

38
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
your feelings for me.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,560

my feelings for you...

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
I know.

42
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,970
I've already known it.

43

Nangong Shi colluded with evil spirits,

60

killed his father and fellow disciples,

61
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
and usurped the position of director.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,190
According to Yiqi Alliance's law,

63
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,360
he'll be expelled

64

65

76
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,200
Do you plead guilty?

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,310
Yes.

78
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,870
Since you admitted to it,

79
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,390
by law,

80
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,560

escaped prison for another reason.

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,720
That day,

86
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,510
he was bewitched with the fox spell

87
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,530
by evil spirits.

88
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,340
That's why he escaped.

89
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,350
We should reconsider

90
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,510
his punishment.

91
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,890
How can a mere fox spell

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,210
manipulate one to this extent?

Fire!

97

There's fire there too!

98

Yan Rushan.

105
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,120
Did you escape prison because you were bewitched

106
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,240
by this spell?

107
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,600
That day,

108
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,070
there was a voice

109
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,510
in my head

110
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,560
egging me on to escape Huntian Prison.

111
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:52,870
Director.

112
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,580
The guard who was threatened by Rushan

113
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,750
said Rushan was acting out in his testimony too.

114
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,760
Even so,

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,750
after sobering up,

116
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,240
you should've turned yourself in immediately.

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,990
Why didn't you come back?

118
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,350
Because he wanted to save me.

119
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,720
Lyu Jianwen.

120
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,170
What do you mean?

121
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,470
Why would Rushan risk his life

122
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
to save you?

123
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,280
Because we love each other.

124
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,250
We've already made our vows

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,130
under Tushan's Grief Tree.

126

Lyu Jianwen.

127
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,789
As a Yiqi Alliance member,

128
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,470
how can you fall in love with a spirit?

129
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,130
Even confessing it in public?

130
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,559
How shameless!

131
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,620
Shameless!

132
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,150
May I ask

133
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,910
if there's a law in Yiqi Alliance

134
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,380
banning humans from loving spirits?

135
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,790
After I fell for a spirit,

136
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,320
have I done anything

137
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,550
to hurt humans?

138
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,720
You can

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,260
punish me for my mistake.

140
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,390
But you can't put me on trial

141
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,370
for loving a spirit.

142
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,030
Everyone,

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,560
among you,

144
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,390
who can tell us

145
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,050
what Constable Lyu did wrong?

146
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,750
If not,

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,050
let's continue.

148
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,630
Director.

149
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,630
Director.

150
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,130
Is it a crime for humans

151
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,440
to love spirits?

152
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,170
Is it a crime for humans

153
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,410
to love spirits?

154
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,750
Loving spirits

155
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,240
is not a crime.

156
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,790
In that case,

157
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,790
Rushan's verdict...

158
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,960
Butler Fei.

159
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,470
Rushan was eager to save a life

160
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,910
and bewitched by the fox spell.

161
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,990
Under such circumstances,

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,790
how should he be punished?

163
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,080
Yiqi Alliance's law values legal principles

164
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,390
and human sentiments.

165
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,650
Rushan's jailbreak

166
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,000
involves

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
extenuating circumstances.

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,870
But he still escaped without permission.

169
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,930
He should get an additional forty years.

170
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,790
Forty years?

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,670
With the previously unfinished sentence,

172
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,070
it's a total of 100 years.

173
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Yan Rushan.

174
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,630
Do you accept your verdict?

175
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,080
I, Yan Rushan,

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,950
plead guilty.

177
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,000
Take Yan Rushan away.

178
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Director.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,460
Rushan's been sentenced,

180
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,100
but we can't dismiss Jianwen's incident

181
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,550
of falling for a spirit.

182
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,480
It isn't a crime,

183
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,250
but Yiqi Alliance was set up to kill spirits.

184
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,390
Since Jianwen fell in love with a spirit,

185
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,510
we should expel her.

186
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,150
Yes, expel her!

187
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,670
Expel her!

188
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,270
Director.

189
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,200
Everyone.

190
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,700
I, Lyu Jianwen,

191
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,720
will resign from the position of constable

192
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,120
and leave Yiqi Alliance.

193
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,080
Please allow me to do so.

194
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,250
Have you really made up your mind?

195
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,000
Your Lyu family's been the backbone

196
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,130
of Yiqi Alliance's legal system.

197
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,620
For a spirit

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,580
with a 100-year jail sentence,

199
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,330
are you really willing

200
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,810
to forsake us and your promising future?

201
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
If this so-called future

202
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,390
means forsaking my love,

203
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,510
I don't

204
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,480
need it.

205
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,670
Granted.

206
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,040
Thank you, Director.

207
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,400
Director Wangquan.

208
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
Today's disaster

209
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,600
occurred because the fox spell

210
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,720
broke through Huntian Prison's defenses.

211
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,450
How will Yiqi Alliance deal with it in the future?

212
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,940
Since Rushan escaped prison,

213
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,870
Yiqi Alliance's sent 3,000 more guards

214
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,470
to guard day and night

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,050
and reinforced the barriers inside and outside the prison.

216
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,040
I'm afraid that

217
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,360
still can't stop the fox spell,

218
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,240
which controls a person's will.

219
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,150
If someone is there,

220
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,960
it can take advantage of them.

221
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,310
I suggest that

222
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,120
since the powerful fox spell

223
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,390
is not unpredictable,

224
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,600
why don't we ask Spirit Alliance's director to help

225
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,480
strengthen Huntian Prison's defenses

226
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,190
to prevent fox spells?

227
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,770
Well...

228
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,320
Then

229
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,540
we can reduce jailbreaks.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,060
More importantly,

231
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,850
similar conflicts between the two alliances

232
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,960
could be curbed.

233
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,030
No way!

234
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,450
Huntian Prison is a vital base of ours.

235
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,650
It can't be tainted by spirits!

236
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,120
Yes, Director.

237
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
What if the spirits are up to something?

238
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,380
It'll be too late then.

239
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,130
Honghong must be

240
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,650
here today for this.

241
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,720
Are you all against it

242
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,490
for Yiqi Alliance's safety

243
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,450
or some so-called dignity?

244
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,420
This...

245
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,710
For Yiqi Alliance's safety, of course!

246
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,140
If someone attacks

247
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,260
Huntian Prison with the fox spell again,

248
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,870
how will you

249
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
protect Yiqi Alliance?

250
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,770
Fight to the death with evil spirits?

251
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,370
Or blame it all on evil spirits?

252
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,150
This can be solved easily

253
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,370
with the alliances' collaboration.

254
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,780
Do we have to split into factions

255
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,700
due to prejudices?

256
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,750
This was an evil spirit's intrusion.

257
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,360
If it's a stronger force next time,

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,630
what will you do?

259
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,060
I've made up my mind.

260
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,270
We'd like Chief of Tushan to help

261
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,900
fix the security loopholes of Huntian Prison.

262
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,820
Chief of Tushan, what do you think?

263
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,900
It's my duty.

264
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,230
Don't comfort me.

265
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,910
I've never been as free

266
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,660
as I am now.

267
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,890
What comfort?

268
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,490
I want to congratulate you.

269
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,500
After slogging away for years,

270
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,600
you finally have time to relax.

271
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,870
If you really envy me,

272
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,200
you can resign anytime.

273
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,970
No need.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
I want to pursue fame and fortune

275
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
to change the future of Yiqi Alliance.

276
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,600
Why did you come to see me alone,

277
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,890
Director Wangquan?

278
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,550
At this point,

279
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,390
you still refuse to tell the truth.

280
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,440
Where did the evil spirit who colluded with Nangong Shi

281
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,480
get their external power from?

282
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,130
How do you know about the external power?

283
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,790
I've been outside the circle.

284
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,840
Aolai Sanshao created the circular boundary

285
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,240
with his power back then.

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
How did you get there?

287
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,540
When Sanshao's rod made that circle,

288
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,550
to bridge the junction between the starting and ending points,

289
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,150
lone members of Yiqi Alliance's Heaven Sect set up their mantra.

290
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,320
Back then,

291
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,360
I cracked the mantra

292
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,760
to leave the circle.

293
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,310
Are you referring to the current Heaven Sect Pass on the border?

294
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,970
That's right.

295
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,940
Who exactly lives outside the circle?

296
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,840
I only know

297
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,580
they can't be killed.

298
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,400
Why?

299
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,140
They're creatures without physical form.

300
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
What's scarier is

301
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,890
they can control people's mind and consciousness.

302
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,640
Anyway,

303
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,400
the external power is mysterious.

304
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,930
It can destroy the six realms.

305
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,880
They mustn't enter the circle.

306
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,500
Have you heard of Tushan Shi Ji?

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,460
The evil spirit

308
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,480
who started the Human-Spirit War centuries ago?

309
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,350
Yes.

310
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,560
Now that she's back,

311
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,640
she's aided by external power.

312
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,680
Yiqi and Spirit Alliances

313
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,920
must join forces now.

314
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,030
I'm sorry.

315
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,180
Since I couldn't shorten your sentence,

316
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,430
you'll be lonely for 100 years

317
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
and never be

318
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,210
with Jianwen in this life.

319
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm just reaping

320
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,870
what I've sown.

321
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,470
I can only bear the consequences.

322
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,120
It’s not anyone’s fault.

323
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,460
Besides, you and Chief

324
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,930
have done a lot for us.

325
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,850
It's good you've come to terms with it.

326
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,830
Actually,

327
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,620
rather than being separated,

328
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,270
it hurts more when the one you love

329
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,160
doesn't love you.

330
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,050
Something troubling you?

331
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,550
Nothing.

332
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,660
Right,

333
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,040
Jianwen asked me to tell you

334
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,960
she's no longer a member of Yiqi Alliance.

335
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,200
She can't visit you as promised.

336
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,070
But she'll wait for you outside,

337
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,010
forever.

338
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,030
Wait for me outside?

339
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,440
Forever?

340
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,030
I have a favor to ask.

341
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,720
Can I meet

342
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,150
Chief?

343
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,520
You want Jianwen to forget you?

344
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,030
Yes.

345
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,350
She and I

346
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,800
aren't meant to be in this life.

347
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,030
Instead of letting her wait endlessly,

348
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,240
let her forget me.

349
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Only in this way

350
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,440
can she forget the pain

351
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,590
and start over.

352
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,970
Please grant me this wish.

353
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,850
Do you know

354
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,380
once she's struck by the sorrow-oblivion spell,

355
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,910
she'll never remember you in every lifetime?

356
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,660
In

357
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,920
every lifetime?

358
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,960
The sorrow-oblivion spell

359
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,120
severs your bond for good.

360
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Once the spell takes effect,

361
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,450
the fate of your love will be gone

362
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,760
and you'll never meet again.

363
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,440
Even so,

364
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,070
I wish she will

365
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,460
forget me completely.

366
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,400
Should we

367
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,480
consult Jianwen on this matter?

368
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,410
Love is between two people.

369
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,590
It's not up to you to decide.

370
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
She won't agree.

371
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,200
So for her own good,

372
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,010
she can't find out about this.

373
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,510
You think it's good for her

374
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,790
to forget you.

375
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,810
But love comes from the heart.

376
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,950
For lovers,

377
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,960
even when separated,

378
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,500
they'll still be happy

379
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,910
to be able to love each other.

380
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,920
No matter what,

381
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,790
I can't let her cling onto

382
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,610
a promise that can't be fulfilled

383
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
and live the rest of her life

384
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,850
pining hopelessly.

385
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,010
Chief, please grant my wish

386
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,600
and teach me this spell.

387
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,270
Chief.

388
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,180
What are your plans?

389
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,000
I'll...

390
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,000
do what I should do.

391
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
I can't go back to Yiqi Alliance,

392
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,680
but many humans still seek my help

393
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
for investigations.

394
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,880
As for him...

395
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,890
It's just a 100-year sentence.

396
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,070
I'll wait for him.

397
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,070
For humans,

398
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,010
a century's a lifetime.

399
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,380
You may wait your whole life

400
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,340
but never see him again.

401
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,260
Even so,

402
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I'll wait for him.

403
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,420
If you still want to be with him in this life,

404
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,750
I might have another way.

405
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,400
What is it?

406
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,390
I can use Grief Tree's power

407
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,680
to turn your memories of him into love

408
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,570
and extend your lifespan.

409
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,720
So after

410
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,350
Rushan's released in 100 years,

411
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,290
you can meet him again.

412
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
But...

413
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,450
But what?

414
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,310
But

415
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,710
you'll forget him

416
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,650
for a century.

417
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,230
You might fall in love

418
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,880
with someone else.

419
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,450
When you reunite, everything would've changed.

420
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,260
But I want to remember him forever.

421
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,130
Thank you, Chief.

422
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,540
What if Rushan also wants you to forget him?

423
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,880
Lovers should

424
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,130
guard their love despite all obstacles.

425
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,770
We can't be together now,

426
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,510
but our hearts are together.

427
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,920
How dare you lure me

428
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,270
to perish with Yuechu together?

429
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,110
How dare you!

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
Do you think you will

431
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,420
be with Honghong together forever then?

432
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,170
Does it hurt?

433
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,080
Does it remind you of your past suffering?

434
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,110
Of course.

435
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,620
How could I forget

436
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,270
that intense pain

437
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,010
where I'd rather die?

438
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,050
Then how dare you betray me?

439
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,820
I like Honghong.

440
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,850
She is my only tie in this world.

441
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,760
Without her,

442
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,020
my life

443
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,560
is no different from death.

444
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,760
Since you love her so much,

445
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,990
why did you cooperate with me to frame her

446
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,250
and deceive her?

447
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:11,960
Tell me!

448
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,680
I regret it.

449
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,310
Do you regret working with me

450
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,960
just to be awakened?

451
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,610
Unfortunately, there's no antidote to regrets.

452
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,280
I'll tell you the truth.

453
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,170
Centuries ago,

454
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,650
from the moment she hurt you,

455
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,170
you and her are destined to be a tragedy!

456
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,370
Darn it.

457
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,810
Not only did I fail to destroy the divine mission,

458
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,160
but it even linked with White Fox's fate.

459
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,010
I told you

460
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,500
your plot

461
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,110
won't succeed.

462
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,740
-Don't underestimate
-Don't underestimate

463
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,200
-your importance to Honghong.
-your importance to Honghong.

464
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,040
You...

465
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,240
You...

466
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,160
You old witch!

467
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,610
What are you doing?

468
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,520
-Tushan Honghong.
-Tushan Honghong.

469
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,840
One wants the other to forget

470
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,030
while the other refuses to forget the other.

471
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,760
Looks like this divine mission

472
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,180
will only get tougher.

473
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,390
Rather than suffering,

474
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,890
isn't it better to be depleted of emotions and desires?

475
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,840
Without emotions and desires,

476
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,620
what's the point of living?

477
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,640
So,

478
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,720
you don't think I should teach Rushan

479
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,670
the sorrow-oblivion spell?

480
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,440
Yes.

481
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,510
Only by loving someone

482
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,920
will life have meaning.

483
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:31,570
I hope the person I love...

484
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,110
can remember every little bit of us.

485
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,070
Whether it's funny, absurd, painful,

486
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,480
or happy,

487
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,810
it's what we've been through.

488
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,110
When our hair turns gray,

489
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,580
they'll tell me

490
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,290
I'm all they need in this life.

491
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,940
The person I want to be with

492
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,840
is not anyone else,

493
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,510
but only her.

494
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,430
Black spiritual butterfly?

495
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,720
What is it?

496
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,390
Shi Ji threatened me with Dongfang Luo's life

497
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,890
to meet with her.

498
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,440
Go back and wait for me.

499
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
I'll be back soon.

500
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,690
I know I can't stop you from saving him,

501
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,310
but let me accompany you.

502
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,590
-I knew you'd come.
-I knew you'd come.

503
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,990
You're not Dongfang Luo?

504
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

505
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,280
-And no.
-And no.

506
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,690
He's under Shi Ji's fox spell.

507
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,010
Not just that.

508
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,410
Shi Ji also infused part of her soul

509
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,040
into his consciousness.

510
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
In that case,

511
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,940
we can only capture him

512
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,110
and not kill him.

513
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,520
That's right.

514
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,790
If you want to kill me,

515
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,070
you have to kill Dongfang Luo first.

516
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,730
Yuechu!

517
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,200
Yuechu.

518
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,190
Watch out!

519
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,050
Dongfang Luo, wake up!

520
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Honghong?

521
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,270
Don't be manipulated by Shi Ji.

522
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,670
This isn't what you want.

523
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:37,990
You said

524
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,340
there are evil humans

525
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
and good spirits,

526
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,190
that humans and spirits will be in peace one day.

527
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,990
Dongfang Luo!

528
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,280
Oh no.

529
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
Honghong has reservations.

530
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,610
She can't kill him.

531
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:57,940
Honghong!

532
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,110
Honghong.

533
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Dongfang Luo.

534
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
I know you can hear me.

535
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,510
Don't forget you said

536
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,200
Honghong's your only tie in the world.

537
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,570
You'll never allow anyone to hurt her!

538
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,680
Trying to trick him into going against me?

539
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,300
Save it.

540
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,410
Honghong,

541
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,550
you're to blame for this ending.

542
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,680
You weren't righteous and selfless enough.

543
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,490
If you'd just died obediently,

544
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,030
you wouldn't have to fight him to death.

545
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,340
Dongfang Luo!

546
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,200
Kill Tushan Honghong

547
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,440
and I'll let you go.

548
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,240
Dongfang Luo!

549
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,700
Honghong!

550
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,550
Are you okay?

551
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,410
Stay by my side later.

552
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,650
I'll protect you.

553
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,880
I'm sorry.

554
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,230
Chi Shan...

555
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,510
was killed by me.

556
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,250
I made many mistakes,

557
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,540
and achieved nothing

558
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,460
I wanted to.

559
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,910
Yuechu.

560
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,500
To meet a friend like you

561
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,750
is the best thing of my return

562
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,560
this time.

563
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm jealous.

564
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,860
And I understand why

565
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,090
you can get what you love.

566
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Honghong.

567
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,150
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,250
This time...

569
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,570
I have to break my promise.

570
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,770
♫Staring into the moonlit sky♫

571
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,790
♫To bury my entire life♫

572
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,389
♫Borrowing a shimmer of light♫

573
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
♫To illuminate you♫

574
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,210
Tushan Honghong.

575
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,500
You still killed him in the end.

576
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,960
For your own ambition,

577
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,230
♫A thousand years feel like a fleeting moment♫

578
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,840
how many more will be sacrificed?

579
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,070
♫This isn't our first time around♫

580
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,159
In this world,

581
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,850
most people's lives are meaningless.

582
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,710
♫Despite all the hardships♫

583
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,389
It's their honor to sacrifice for me.

584
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,949
♫The warmth of love still remains♫

585
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:49,090
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

586
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,190
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

587
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,230
♫If you look back♫

588
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,400
Honghong.

589
00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,590
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

590
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,110
Be it the past or present,

591
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,200
his deaths are not your fault.

592
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,510
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

593
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,140
This is his choice.

594
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,180
You've done your best.

595
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,940
♫To bury my entire life♫

596
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:17,200
♫Looking back, how can I make it worth it?♫

597
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,340
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

598
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,340
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

601
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,920
I am his...

602
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,610
only friend.

603
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,420
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

604
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,710
♫To bury my entire life♫

605
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:01,230
♫When I look back, you're under the tree of longing♫

606
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,110
His only...

607
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:00,880
friend?

608
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,880
What's wrong?

609
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,620
You've been acting weird since just now.

610
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,580
You don't love Dongfang Luo?

611
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,760
Why do you ask?

612
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,570
Answer me.

613
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,030
I don't.

614
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,500
You also think

615
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,330
Rushan should respect Jianwen.

616
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,020
He can't decide on their relationship on his own.

617
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,750
But have you ever respected me?

618
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,780
Before you'd forgotten me,

619
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,840
did you consult me?

620
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,930
Forget you?

621
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,200
What are you talking about?

622
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,030
We bought

623
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,440
this mask at Human Market together.

624
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Many years ago,

625
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,030
you saved me back to Tushan

626
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,940
and cultivated with me.

627
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,840
You forced me to roast chicken.

628
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,970
Together, we defeated Jin Renfeng,

629
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:32,240
watched Princess Bu Tai and Shi Kuan get together,

630
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,970
established Spirit Alliance,

631
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,410
and many more.

632
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,760
I've lived in the mini pavilion for 16 years.

633
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,800
I even

634
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,370
confessed to you here.

635
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,420
You rejected me...

636
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,290
and even cruelly forgot me.

637
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,400
If it wasn't for Dongfang Luo,

638
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,960
what was it for?
