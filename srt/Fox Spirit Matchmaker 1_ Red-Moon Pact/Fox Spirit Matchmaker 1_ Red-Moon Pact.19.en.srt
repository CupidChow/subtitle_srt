[Episode 19]

4
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,840
I told you...

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,930
not to do such things again.

6
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,410
This is the last time.

7
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,920
Lady Fairy.

8
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Give me your hand.

9
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,520
This is...

10
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,660
Another secret of Dongfang Blood.

11
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,150
You'll be immune to Divine Flame

12
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,550
after washing your hands

13
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,280
with it for three months.

14
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,120
Lady Fairy.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,750
From now on,

16
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,240
you don't have to fear

17
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,900
Dongfang's Purest Sun Flame.

18
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,800
Blood aura?

19
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,130
Your wound hasn't healed yet?

20
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,720
My recovery's slow.

21
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,050
You're so cautious.

22
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,070
Is the water made of gold?

23
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,250
It's more valuable than gold.

24
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,560
Are you touched?

25
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,940
If so,

26
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,370
I have a request.

27
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,240
What is it?

28
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,440
I want you to arrange

29
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,450
a matchmaking ceremony for me...

30
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,460
So I can ask Grief Tree for a Feathered Flower.

31
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,310
I thought

32
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,260
you're aware of how I feel.

33
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,870
Of course.

34
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm clearer than ever.

35
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,460
I want Grief Tree

36
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
to witness this love.

37
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
What you're doing

38
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,150
is meaningless.

39
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I just want to fulfill my obsession.

40
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,470
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,390
I can't.

42
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,510
Why?

43
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,720
Other spirits,

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,600
including Princess Bu Tai,

45
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,130
could prove their feelings under Grief Tree.

46
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,290
Why can't I?

47
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,570
Because what you wish for...

48
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,680
will never happen.

49
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,020
There are things

50
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,750
you have to try out

51
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
before you can come to a conclusion.

52
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,830
Your work is done.

53
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,780
You may leave.

54
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,600
Grief Tree.

55
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,730
Lady Fairy didn't agree to ask for the flower for me.

56
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,300
Can you feel my love?

57
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,720
All kinds of obsessions

58
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,110
are bound here.

59
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,380
I ask for nothing else,

60
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
except that in a century,

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,020
when Lady Fairy sees this flower,

62
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,890
it'll remind her of a passer-by in her life

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,090
who cared about her so much.

64
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Dongfang Yuechu.

65
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,580
This is the matchmaking event

66
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,400
just for you.

67
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,510
May the world be filled with good times

68
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,130
and all the stars

69
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,070
illuminate her nights

70
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,130
so she never knows sorrow.

71
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,640
Neither can I...

72
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,920
accept

73
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,560
or

74
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,720
refuse

75
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,140
this love.

76
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,200
Yuechu.

77
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,510
What's the matter so early in the morning?

78
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,150
Yeah.

79
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,480
You were so urgent.

80
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,210
What's wrong?

81
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,370
Are you going out?

82
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,030
I'm leaving Tushan.

83
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,400
Leave Tushan?

84
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,050
Where are you going?

85
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,570
Did Chief assign a new task

86
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,450
to you?

87
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,120
Are you

88
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,350
going back to Divine Flame Villa to be its master?

89
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,910
Then why?

90
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,960
Although spirits live in Tushan,

91
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
this is your home after all.

92
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,460
And you have good friends like us.

93
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,150
Yes.

94
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,600
Can you bear to leave us?

95
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,920
I called you here

96
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,040
because I couldn't bear to.

97
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,680
It's usually a vixen matchmaking in Tushan,

98
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,250
but this is a rare fate.

99
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,270
As your friend,

100
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,390
I don't want you two

101
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,370
to miss out on it.

102
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,790
Jiushuang.

103
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,220
The person you like likes you back.

104
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,280
This is so rare.

105
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,210
Cherish it.

106
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,000
Who said I don't cherish it?

107
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Jiushuang...

108
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,390
Yuechu.

109
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,690
If you encounter any difficulties

110
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,270
or you can't survive outside,

111
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,530
remember to come back.

112
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,380
Tushan will always be your home.

113
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,200
Bye.

[Recruitment notice]

115
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,900
Traitor!

Joining Yiqi Alliance's

117

recruitment tryouts behind our backs?

118
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,590
Let me ask you.

119
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,720
How did Tushan fail you?

120
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,390
Why are you helping those jerks

121
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,650
fight against Tushan?

122
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,850
Yaya.

123
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,140
Can you pretend you didn't see me and let me go?

124
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,810
No.

125
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,520
You can leave Tushan

126
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,380
only after you trample over me.

127
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,510
This wine's just to my liking.

128
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,840
If only there were more.

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880
Let go of me!

130
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,550
Using the magic we taught you to subdue us?

131
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,390
Traitor!

132
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,550
Traitor of Tushan!

133
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,100
Yaya.

134
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,390
I'll give it back to you.

135
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,890
Enough.

136
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,270
You can't stop me.

137
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I advise you

138
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,170
to study more about cold magic

139
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
and master Absolute Zero soon.

140
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,440
Lady Fairy's power moves

141
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,410
don't suit you.

142
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,290
Are you really leaving?

143
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,750
Rongrong.

144
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,810
Are you going to stop me?

145
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,630
Actually,

146
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,540
I was entrusted by Yaoxin Shop's owner

147
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,080
to catch you.

148
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,910
You owe him three months' snack money.

149
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,710
Tushan won't pay it back for you.

150
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,410
Well...

151
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,930
Are you leaving without paying your debt?

152
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,460
Also,

153
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,200
since you've decided to leave,

154
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,340
why did you leave a Divine Flame

155
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,720
in the mini pavilion?

156
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,790
Because I want to protect everything in Tushan.

157
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Rongrong.

158
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,800
Use the most common summoning spell

159
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,920
to summon the fire.

160
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
Then you'll know why.

161
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,120
This...

162
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,170
Why's this happening?

163
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,090
From now on,

164
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,840
Tushan can summon Purest Sun Flame anytime.

165
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,700
If spirits come to cause trouble,

166
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
you can use Divine Flame to drive them away.

167
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
This is the only thing

168
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,700
I can do for Tushan now.

169
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,000
Divine Flame?

170
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
You did this for...

171
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,870
So please take care of my debts, Rongrong!

172
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,550
Let's settle our debt later!

173
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,010
I'll pay you back someday!

174
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,790
Thank you!

175
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,260
Why are you here?

176
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,360
You still want to leave?

177
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,460
Don't persuade me to stay.

178
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,980
We'll get a chance to meet again anyway.

179
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,510
That's all for now.

180
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Leave if you want.

181
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,020
If you leave,

182
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,240
the other foxes might miss you,

183
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,860
but I won't.

184
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,530
Are you here...

185
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,960
just to tell me this?

186
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,600
Of course not.

187
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,890
I'm here to retrieve

188
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,610
what Tushan left in you.

189
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,360
This is the Heaven & Earth Thread.

190
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,140
Since you don't want to go with me,

191
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,540
I'll leave this with you.

192
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,400
No matter where you go,

193
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,700
I'll be able to find you.

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,870
and controlling the six realms.

382
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,750
But you've never truly empathized

383
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,150
with the people you control

384
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,500
and serve them.

385
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,960
Motivated by hatred?

386
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,150
You think you're different from me?

387
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,310
Don't forget

388
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,920
our power comes from Grief Tree,

389
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,110
that is hatred.

390
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,520
That's right.

391
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,200
Tushan's Grief Tree

392
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,770
absorbs love from matchmaking spirits

393
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,510
and creates more love with it.

394
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,670
But what about you?

395
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,530
Didn't your power

396
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,500
come from you killing Dongfang Luo?

397
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,520
Do you want me to tell you a way

398
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,680
to bring Dongfang Luo back to you?

399
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,970
How could I forget

400
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,290
you love someone else now?

401
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,380
Even if you don't want Dongfang Luo to return to you,

402
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,310
you have to protect your dear Dongfang Yuechu.

403
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,990
What do you want?

404
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,900
Dongfang Yuechu's joining the Yiqi Alliance tryouts.

405
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,680
How could I miss such a good opportunity

406
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,020
to target him?

407
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,220
Please enlighten me.

408
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,670
Thank you.

409
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,120
Those are spiritual skills.

410
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,690
Those are spiritual skills.

411
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,770
They're not human skills.

412
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,910
You cultivated spiritual skills?

413
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,830
What's wrong with that?

414
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,790
Knowing yourself and your enemy is the way to secure wins.

415
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,900
What if I run into an evil spirit

416
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,080
in the wild?

417
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,890
I'm familiarizing with their moves beforehand.

418
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,270
How arrogant.

419
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,720
You want to sneak into Yiqi Alliance by being flamboyant.

420
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,430
I've seen many people like you.

421
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,160
You're right and wrong.

422
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,070
I'm trying to be flamboyant.

423
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,400
But I'm not sneaking in.

424
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,340
I'm participating sincerely

425
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,790
to change Yiqi Alliance.

426
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,290
How arrogant!

427
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,280
If you can take ten moves from me,

428
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,160
I can consider

429
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,930
taking you in.

430
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,770
Ten moves? Is that enough?

431
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,510
How about I give you 100 moves?

432
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,120
Look carefully.

433
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,550
I won't use spiritual skills this time.

434
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,480
Using magic tools so soon?

435
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,080
It's a pity that magic tools

436
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,440
being family heirlooms

437
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,400
isn't the human race's future.

438
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,340
Do you know what nonsense you're talking about?

439
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,960
Nonsense?

440
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,600
When you saw me use spiritual skills,

441
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,670
you rushed onto the stage.

442
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,030
What?

443
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,000
Are you afraid they can't defeat me?

444
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,400
You...

445
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,000
What do you mean?

446
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,310
Do you know what

447
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,790
the biggest conflict between humans and spirits is?

448
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,910
It's that there are four spirit emperors,

449
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,780
but only one Wangquan sword.

450
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,070
So what?

451
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,660
When all the aristocrats of Yiqi Alliance are united,

452
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,100
be it one or four spirit emperors,

453
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,350
we're not afraid of them.

454
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,610
What about the other humans and spirits?

455
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,290
Humans fear spirits

456
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,480
due to a disparity in power among humans.

457
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,780
If we get rid of the corrupt custom

458
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,440
of aristocrats governing Yiqi Alliance

459
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,940
and every human has a magic tool,

460
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,730
be it a weak or strong human,

461
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,530
everyone can cultivate

462
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,610
and contribute their strength

463
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,600
to create a prosperous and peaceful human race.

464
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,820
It's an endless virtuous cycle.

465
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,920
This

466
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,010
is the human race's future.

467
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,470
Human race's future?

468
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,280
Ridiculous!

469
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,240
Aristocrats protect humans

470
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,210
from being hurt by spirits.

471
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,440
You're just monopolizing

472
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,840
the bulk of the resources

473
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,410
so that commoners can only rely on you.

474
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,170
Cut the crap.

475
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,680
What's going on?

476
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,510
Did you see that?

477
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,400
Dongfang Yuechu hates Dongfang Luo

478
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,070
to the core.

479
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,170
I can't kill him.

480
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,500
Think about it.

481
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,880
You want to destroy him.

482
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,440
You want him to disappear,

483
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,320
even from her memories.

484
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,000
It was just a coincidence

485
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,710
that they met.

486
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
She doesn't know him,

487
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,670
his character,

488
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,840
his childhood,

489
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,360
or his likes and dislikes.

490
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
Nothing!

491
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,230
But because he made her feel guilty,

492
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,480
he became the love she couldn't let go of

493
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
and get over.

494
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,790
Didn't you leave Tushan

495
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
just to erase him from her heart?

496
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
If you can't do it,

497
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,360
I can help you.

498
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,730
Will I be happy

499
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,200
if I kill him?

500
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,650
Will Lady Fairy really be happy?

501
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,840
The Lady Fairy

502
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,360
I met

503
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,550
and got to know

504
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,480
is the version of her who knows him.

505
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,290
If I erase him from her memories,

506
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,220
is she still my Lady Fairy?

507
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,140
♫Gentle as water♫

508
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,450
I left Tushan

509
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,880
not to erase Dongfang Luo

510

511

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,750
♫So I deserve, I deserve♫

568
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,600
♫To cry myself hoarse♫

569
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,900
♫So I endure, I endure♫

570
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
♫Pretending to be innocent♫

571
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,550
♫Don't try to shut me down♫

572
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,740
♫So I hate and love♫

573
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,360
♫With burning passion♫

574
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,590
♫Why hide, why hide♫

575
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,200
♫Behind a perfect facade♫

576
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,730
♫Unarmed, I wipe my tears♫

577
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,160
♫And face everything with a smile♫
