Just send him away.

193
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,220
Since you can't tolerate him,

194
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,570
why don't you drive him away?

195

197
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,500
and magic powers.

198
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,760
It should be easy

199
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,730
to kick him out.

200
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,210
He has no powers?

201
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
If I send him away,

202
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,390
will he die?

203
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,030
Forget it then.

He must have other intentions.

211

Moreover, humans are evil and cunning.

Raising a human kid in Tushan

213
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,290
would be raising a wolf among the sheep.

214

Even if I'd risk angering you,

215

I've to do my duty as an elder.

216
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,610
We can't keep that brat.

217
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,830
So you're forcing me to give you an explanation?

218
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,890
That’s right.

219

an explanation,

221
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
I will...

222
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,980
I won't leave Huguang Pavilion.

223

226
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,650
calm down.

227
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,120

228
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,440

We can't let our guard down.

232

That's more like it.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,700
Why are you still here?

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,180
Yes.

235
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,820
I'll take my leave.

236
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,950
What a bad temper.

237
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,980
No wonder a beauty like you

But if Tushan needs you one day,

244

you have to sacrifice your spiritual blood

258
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,920

that Dongfang Spiritual Blood

260

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,610
see the Grief Tree.

568
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,530
Okay.

569
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,810
That force's indeed strengthened.

570
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,050
Honghong!

571
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,530
I'm fine.

572
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,440
Grief Tree was invaded by the Dark Force

573
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
and is on the wane.

574
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,620
I couldn't find the source

575
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,670
despite years of investigation.

576
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,550
Who's plotting against Tushan?

577
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,320
[Dark Grief Tree's heart]

578
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,170
So powerful.

579
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,200
The exorcism move doesn't require cold aura.

580
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,460
Suppress the enemy with absolute strength.

581
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:42,590
Use your mind

582
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,200
to gather your spirit power in your fist.

583
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,530
The greater your spirit power,

584
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,860
the stronger your fist.

585
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Next, practice by yourselves.

586
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,290
J-Jiushuang.

587
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,050
Don't rush it.

588
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,850
Your main duty as a female fox

589
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,730
is to matchmake us spirits.

590
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,310
Yaya.

591
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,360
Sorry, Yaya.

592
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,690
Yaya.

593
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,820
I have something to ask you.

594
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,620
The exorcism move can even transform with magic tools?

595
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,500
You know the exorcism move?

596
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,680
Still deny you didn't eavesdrop?

597
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,840
Yaya, you misunderstood.

598
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,210
I admire you for your superior

599
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,120
spirit power,

600
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,250
so I couldn't help but imitate you.

601
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,850
All right, why are you looking for me?

602
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,120
Yaya.

603
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,240
I was supposed to take Lady Fairy's class today,

604
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
but it became your class.

605
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,810
Where did she go?

606
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,910
You want to know?

607
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,110
I won't tell you.

608
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,500
Are you not telling me or do you not know?

609
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
Trying to provoke me?

610
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,600
I won't fall for that.

611
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,480
Fine.

612
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,120
Then don't blame me for being disloyal.

613
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,300
Your Endless Wine Gourd

614
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,250
is filled with Elder's Chunlin wine, yeah?

615
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,730
I know he has a bad temper

616
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,210
and nags a lot.

617
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:50,040
If he knows you stole his wine,

618
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,540
he'd nag in your ears

619
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,520
till the end of time.

620
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,400
Fine.

621
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,380
I'll tell you, okay?

622
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,750
The wolf spirit who collects debts in the market died.

623
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,520
Honghong went to investigate with Rongrong.

624
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,180
She doesn't have time for you.

625
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,330
The wolf spirit who collects debts in the market died?

626
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,220
The money's still here.

627
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,890
So it's not for money.

628
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,850
Could it be revenge?

629
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,250
But when I was choosing the creditor,

630
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,170
I investigated this wolf.

631
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,530
He's always alone,

632
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,770
without relatives or enemies.

633
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,380
A revenge murder is unlikely.

634
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,730
Look at his wound.

635
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,320
A sword wound?

636
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,770
The wound is smooth and even.

637
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm afraid you can't find

638
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,900
such a sharp sword in Tushan.

639
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,100
In that case,

640
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,450
someone sneaked into Tushan?

641
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,400
The wolf's hair is rough

642
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,520
and grey.

643
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,100
But this strand of hair is so soft

644
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,370
and black.

645
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,090
It's clearly not his.

646
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,890
The Dark Force?

647
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,340
This force's never left Grief Tree

648
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,470
and gone elsewhere.

649
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,620
How did this happen?

650
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,560
You're right.

651
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,450
It's the first time

652
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,850
this force's appeared outside Grief Tree.

653
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,700
Apart from going around in Tushan,

654
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,400
the wolf is no different from the spirits in the market.

655
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,960
Looks like their target is still Tushan.

656
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,280
The boy's name is Yuechu?

657
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,270
He appeared in Tushan many years ago?

658
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,520
Yes.

659
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,100
[Divine Flame Villa's disciple: Fu Cheng]

660
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,170
Tushan forbids humans from entering,

661
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,890
let alone taking them in.

662
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,650
That boy

663
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,520
must be Dongfang Yuechu.

664
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,600
Congratulations, Master.

665
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,600
You've finally located the source of Dongfang Blood.

666
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,210
Are you congratulating me

667
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,480
or celebrating for yourself?

668
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,210
I dare not.

669
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,770
Without the Dongfang Blood,

670
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,560
I have to rely on a drug tester like you

671
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,480
to purify my spiritual blood.

672
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,290
It doesn’t feel good, does it?

673
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,290
It’s my honor to serve you, Master.

674
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,060
[Beginning of fate]

675
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,810
Father!

676
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,440
How are you?

677
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
Watch out!

678
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,770
Tushan Honghong?

679
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,360
How dare a mere fox spirit

680
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,690
covet the Dongfang Spiritual Blood?

681
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,430
Your chicken's roasted well.

682
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,260
Are you always following me

683
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,290
for my Dongfang Blood?

684
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,320
Wait.

685
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,920
Then you wouldn't

686
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,120
go to all this trouble

687
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,860
and just killed me long ago.

688
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,330
You never showed up

689
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,590
until I was roasting chicken.

690
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,290
Could it be...

691
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,720
you like my roasted chicken?

692
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Don't come over.

693
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,520
You have Dongfang Blood

694
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,120
and dealt with Jin Renfeng.

695
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,850
They won't let you go.

696
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you wanna stay with the humans

697
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,490
or go to Tushan with me?

698
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,080
It's up to you.
