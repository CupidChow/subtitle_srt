[Wangquan Villa]

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Jin Renfeng

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,200
gathered various sects of Yiqi Alliance

7
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,030
to attack Tushan?

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,950
That's right.

9
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,660
The disciples guarding Tushan

10
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,810
just sent a message.

11
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,240
It's said that Jin Renfeng claimed

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,150
Second Young Lady, Qinlan's son is in Tushan.

13
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,699
On the day the Tiger and Crane Immortals were killed in the market,

14
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,770
we did receive a letter

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,870
from someone who claimed to be the son of Second Young Lady.

16
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,960
After that, I have been investigating but to no avail.

17
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,360
Back then, when Jin Renfeng killed his master to seize his position,

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,400
Qinlan was forced to leave

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,520
and went missing.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,350
If she really has a descendant,

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,520
we can't let them suffer anymore.

22
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,440
Take some men to Tushan now.

23
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,960
If that child is there,

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,150
we must protect him

25
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,930
and bring him back to the villa.

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,460
Yes, Sir.

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,890
Fu Cheng!

28
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,370
Fu Cheng.

29
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,450
Someone from Divine Flame Villa?

30
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,280
You misunderstood.

31
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,120
Although she's from Divine Flame Villa,

32
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,050
she hates Jin Renfeng just like us.

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,470
That day in the city,

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,190
you were able to stop the disciples of Yiqi Alliance

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,710
thanks to the messages she sent.

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,960
But–

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,490
A life's at stake. Hurry up!

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,770
Fu Cheng.

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,670
Fu Cheng!

40
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,580
She's poisoned with Sorrowful Tear.

41
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,240
She needs to take the antidote every seven days.

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,910
Judging from her current condition,

43
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,710
the window for her to take the antidote has passed.

44
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,730
How long more can she last?

45
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,710
She won't last longer than six hours.

46
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,710
If we want to save her,

47
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,770
we have to be quick.

48
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,140
Leave me alone.

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I brought all these upon myself.

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,960
Fu Cheng!

51
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,860
Let's save her first

52
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,360
then go help Lady Fairy.

53
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,280
Tushan Honghong.

54
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,970
You won't be able to escape today!

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,030
Red Lotus Spirit-devouring Formation.

56
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,490
With blood as the trigger,

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,370
no matter how strong your spirit power is,

58
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,360
when you fall into this formation,

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,890
you will be burned to ashes!

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,780
Do you know?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,870
Divine Blood Red Lotus Spirit-devouring Formation

62
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,870
can be countered with the Claw of Insulation.

63
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,590
Darned Tushan spirit...

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,920
Your ribs are broken,

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,409
and your organs are damaged.

66
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,870
Get your men to carry you back to recuperate.

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,650
From now on,

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,100
anyone not invited

69
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,580
will not be allowed in Tushan.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,890
If you cross the line again,

71
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,850
I won't let you off easily.

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,190
Do you think...

73
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,690
this is the end?

74
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,620
Refined Spirit Core?

75
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,050
Indeed.

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,520
This is my ultimate skill.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,050
Strange.

78
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,409
Why is Jin Renfeng's Divine Flame burning even brighter?

79
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,400
No! I must save her!

80
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,730
Brat, do you want to die?

81
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,430
You used up so much power just now.

82
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,760
You'll die if you go now.

83
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,680
Jin Renfeng's target is me.

84
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,940
Only I can save her.

85
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,310
Lai.

86
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,330
Do me a favor.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,530
Send Fu Cheng back to Tushan immediately.

88
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,930
Only you can save her now.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,750
Don't worry.

90
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,970
Tushan Honghong.

91
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,350
Aren’t you very strong?

92
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,140
My Divine Flame is now

93
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,040
invincible.

94
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,020
Even you

95
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,690
wouldn't be able to take it.

96
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,720
Sister!

97
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:09,680
Sister!

98
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,520
Leave now!

99
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,620
Today,

100
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,170
I'm going to kill you spirits from Tushan

101
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,110
and take revenge!

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Rongrong!

103
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,510
Bastard!

104
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,510
The consciousness of the world!

105
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,780
Lady Fairy.

106
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,630
Dongfang Yuechu!

107
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,480
I'll bring you back to Divine Flame Villa

108
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,880
after I destroy these Tushan spirits!

109
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,120
Who told you to come?

110
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,250
I told you,

111
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,890
I'll protect you.

112
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,870
This brat is from the Dongfang family.

113
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,630
Lady Fairy,

114
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,320
let me tell you

115
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,330
the secret of the Dongfang bloodline.

Impossibl!

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,260
He lost too much blood.

141
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,150
I can only seal his heart first

142
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,210
and then use the Blood-making Magic.

143
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,630
He saved you with the blood from his heart this time.

144
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,750
His spiritual power is greatly damaged.

145
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,950
It will take some time

146
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,150
for him to recover.

147
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,360
Thank you.

148
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,150
It seems

149
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,120
he entrusted his life to you.

150
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,920
But only in this way

151
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,730
could he help you win this battle

152
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,860
by reversing the situation

153
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,190
and retreat unscathed.

154
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,540
But now that his identity is exposed,

155
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,890
I'm afraid he can't

156
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,880
stay in Tushan anymore.

157
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,750
Liushang!

158
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,910
Calm down.

159
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,670
Don't be so agitated!

160
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,470
Don't stop me!

161
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,480
Wuli! Liushang!

162
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,040
Rongrong.

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,760
Is Yuechu really from the Dongfang family?

164
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,390
Yes, he is indeed a descendant of the Dongfang family.

165
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,940
Dongfang Yuechu.

166
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,480
Why can he, a descendant of the Dongfang family,

167
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,320
enter Tushan

168
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,870
and stay here for so many years?

169
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,360
Did Chief know about this from the start?

170
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,000
Rongrong,

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,130
Liushang is just...

172
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,600
Your parents died in the hands of Divine Flame Villa.

173
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,320
I understand

174
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,720
your resentment towards the Dongfang family.

175
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,920
Tonight at midnight,

176
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,130
Cui Yuling will leave to make medicine.

177
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,760
Yuechu is currently in a coma.

178
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,700
If you want to kill him,

179
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,090
I won't stop you.

180
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,510
Midnight...

181
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,110
Liushang.

182
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,270
Liushang!

183
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,840
Rongrong.

184
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,150
Liushang!

185
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,490
What if Liushang really does something to Yuechu...

186
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,090
Are you...

187
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,950
worried about Yuechu?

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,550
No.

189
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,210
I'm just afraid that Liushang will be scolded by Chief.

190
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,870
You hate Divine Flame Villa

191
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,240
because they

192
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,480
killed many spirits in the war between humans and spirits.

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,810
But has Yuechu ever killed a spirit?

194
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,840
In that case, does it make a difference if he's just Yuechu

195
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,440
or Dongfang Yuechu?

196
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,680
I understand now...

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,560
You know that

198
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,390
everyone is close to Yuechu,

199
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,890
so Liushang wouldn't–

200
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,460
It's not good to be too smart.

201
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,670
She's from Yiqi Alliance.

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,440
You brought her here?

203
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,680
Of course not.

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,130
It's Yuechu.

205
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,270
Yuechu?

206
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,670
Are you close to him?

207
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,360
Could it be...

208
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,610
You knew his identity?

209
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,670
There's nothing I don't know.

210
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,360
So...

211
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,240
you,

212
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,600
Honghong and Rongrong all know about this,

213
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,930
but only kept it from me.

214
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,890
It's all that brat's fault.

215
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,130
Him hiding in Tushan aside,

216
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,600
he even brought people in.

217
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,040
Does he think

218
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,180
Tushan is

219
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,980
Divine Flame Villa's shelter?

220
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,800
You don't mean that, do you?

221
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,800
Can you bear to see Yuechu

222
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,400
die in Jin Renfeng's hands?

223
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,010
That's a different matter.

224
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,120
Anyway, when that brat wakes up,

225
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,670
we have to settle the score with him.

226
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,030
Kick this person out of Tushan now.

227
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,850
Kick her out?

228
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,720
I can't.

229
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,390
The most important thing now is to find Jin Renfeng.

230
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,320
Let me ask you.

231
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,200
How do you plan on doing that?

232
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,840
I...

233
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Of course I will...

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,960
So,

235
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,290
don't be too impulsive.

236
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,150
He's cunning.

237
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,480
If we are going to search for him all over the world,

238
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,390
it's finding a needle in a haystack.

239
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,990
If we really want to find him,

240
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,440
we have to rely on her.

241
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,600
Her?

242
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,360
What can she do?

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,840
She was...

244
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,900
a trusted aide of Jin Renfeng.

245
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,670
Master.

246
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,870
This place is far away from Tushan.

247
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,000
It will take them some time to catch up.

248
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,410
Tushan won't let us go so easily.

249
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,660
I didn't expect

250
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,910
that little bastard to risk his life

251
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
by giving the heart from his blood to Tushan Honghong.

252
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
If it weren't for that,

253
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,910
I would have killed that fox spirit!

254
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,670
Divine Blood

255
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,040
would've already been mine!

256
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,270
Master, take it easy.

257
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,240
I’ll arrange for you

258
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,670
to return to Divine Flame Villa to recuperate as soon as possible.

259
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,320
No!

260
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,150
With this battle,

261
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,270
those from Wangquan

262
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,300
are already suspecting Divine Flame Villa.

263
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,600
If we go back,

264
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,910
we will die.

265
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:11,770
Butler Fei.

266
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,310
Some of the small sects from the alliance

267
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,109
have also come to Tushan this time.

268
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,130
According to the survivors,

269
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,589
Jin Renfeng killed many disciples

270
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:18,920
to set up the formation.

271
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,589
Luckily, Tushan Honghong showed up

272
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,460
so the rest

273
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,349
could escape.

274
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,190
Formation?

275
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,970
Yes.

276
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,790
It is said that Jin Renfeng used blood as the trigger

277
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,720
to set up an evil formation.

278
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,920
Fortunately, there was a descendant of Dongfang family

279
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,160
hiding in Tushan called Yuechu.

280
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,960
I heard he voluntarily

281
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,720
gave his spiritual blood from his heart

282
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,120
to help Tushan's chief defeat Jin REnfeng.

283
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,880
So,

284
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,330
he's staying in Tushan voluntarily?

285
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

286
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,210
Send my message to Tushan Honghong.

287
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,590
That I would like to meet her for something important.

288
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,110
Yes.

289
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,200
Y-You will really kill him?

290
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,410
Of course.

291
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,480
I have a blood feud with him to start with.

292
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Yet he still cheated me and was so close to me normally.

293
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,790
She's left.

294
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,460
What are you going to do?

295
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm going in to take revenge.

296
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,630
What's wrong?

297
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,000
Cui Yuling

298
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,930
seems to have returned.

299
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,790
No?

300
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,680
There's no one around.

301
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,900
Really?

302
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Dongfang Yuechu!

303
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,420
I won't let you off easily!

304
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,000
Wh-Where is he?

305
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,880
This brat.

306
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,810
Count him lucky!

307
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
It's so late.

308
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,330
Where can he go?

309
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,390
I don't care.

310
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,300
He's covered in wounds

311
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,310
yet still wandering around.

312
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,640
I hope the pain gets to him, he deserves it!

313
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,550
Luckily, it's the full moon today,

314
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,530
so my spirit power can be barely recovered

315
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,730
to help heal him.

316
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,270
Lady Fairy.

317
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,230
The battle

318
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,110
had taken up almost all of your spirit power.

319
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,440
Why are you still pushing yourself for me?

320
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
One careless move

321
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
will hurt your body.

322
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,880
You know that too?

323
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,880
How can you draw your blood from your heart easily?

324
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,360
If anything happens to you,

325
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,820
where can I find another Dongfang Yuechu at?

326
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,720
Sister.

327
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,580
Butler Fei of Wangquan Villa requested to see you.

328
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,660
Thank you, Tushan's chief, for defeating Jin Renfeng.

329
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,480
Otherwise, the disciples of the alliance will continue to be killed.

330
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,590
This disturbance

331
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,260
is not what we expected,

332
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,030
and we would like to ask for your forgiveness.

333
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,200
Is there anything else?

334
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,740
There's another favor we would like to ask.

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,260
It's about Dongfang Yuechu.

336
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,900
Third level of Purest Sun Flame!

337
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
I've mastered it!

338
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,350
Lady Fairy!

339
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,240
I've mastered the third level

340
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,370
of Purest Sun Flame!

341
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,940
I did it!

342
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,920
I did it!

343
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,000
Back then,

344
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,110
even my mom couldn't get to the third level.

345
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,710
I didn't expect that I could.

346
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,110
Maybe Cui Yuling's medicine has amazing powers.

347
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,750
Or maybe,

348
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,930
your injury this time connected your veins.

349
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,270
Whatever the reason is,

350
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,670
it's worth celebrating.

351
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,120
Let's go, Lady Fairy.

352
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,960
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

353
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,160
You'll be satisfied.

354
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,880
Lady Fairy.

355
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,150
What's wrong?

356
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,240
Did Wangquan Villa come to Tushan

357
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,720
to look for me?

358
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
Butler Fei did propose

359
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,680
to take you back to Wangquan Villa.

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,990
What did you say?

361
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,510
You didn't agree, did you?

362
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,810
You don't want to go?

363
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,790
Lady Fairy.

364
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,830
Do you know how

365
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,240
the strongest soldiers of Wangquan Villa's Yiqi Alliance

366
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,400
came about?

367
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,880
My grandfather had

368
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,440
only two daughters.

369
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,830
Other than my mother,

370
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,920
he had an eldest daughter named Huaizhu.

371
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,410
[Divine Flame Villa Eldest Young Lady:
Dongfang Huaizhu]

372
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,720
After Jin Renfeng killed his master to take over the position,

373
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,590
Aunt Huaizhu wanted to invite other aristocrats of Yiqi Alliance

374
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,590
to help them.

375
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,610
But unexpectedly,

376
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,640
the aristocrats were either on the stronger party's side,

377
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,170
or protecting themselves.

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
Even the most powerful Wangquan family

379
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,190
just stood by and watched.

380
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:15,120
[Wangquan Villa]

381
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,200
In the end,

382
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
in order to escape from Jin Renfeng,

383
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,160
Aunt Huaizhu was forced to marry into Wangquan family as a concubine,

384
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,090
to birth a soldier of Yiqi Alliance

385
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,200
for Wangquan family with Dongfang Spiritual Blood.

386
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,750
Yet, she died from obstructed labor.

387
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,790
Wangquan Hongye did not kill anyone,

388
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,270
but Aunt Huaizhu did die because of him.

389
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,140
Yes.

390
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,090
He feels guilty now.

391
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,730
And wants to make up for it.

392
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,720
But I’m not qualified to forgive him in Aunt Huaizhu's stead.

393
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,740
I see.

394
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,170
I thought you would be reluctant to leave Tushan.

395
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,270
I...

396
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,440
Of course I would be reluctant to leave.

397
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I eat, drink, and sleep for free every day.

398
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,030
I even get to pat foxes every day for free.

399
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,560
This is a comfortable life.

400
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,080
So

401
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,590
you know you're bullying the little fox spirits too?

402
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,270
I...

403
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,110
I'm staying in Tushan anyway. I'm not going anywhere.

404
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,550
Wangquan Villa wants to take you back.

405
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,680
But there's no free lunch in the world.

406
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,100
In any way,

407
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,500
all your expenses in Tushan

408
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,760
all these years should be accounted for.

409
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,830
Unfortunately, though Wangquan family

410
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,510
may seem wealthy,

411
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,390
they're very petty.

412
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,640
They wouldn't even pay

413
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,970
a small sum for alimony.

414
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,110
A small sum?

415
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,680
Lady Fairy,

416
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,790
how much did you ask them for?

417
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,680
Not much.

418
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
Adding it up,

419
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,500
it's just about

420
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,590
100,000 taels...

421
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,010
Of gold.

422
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,890
100,000 taels of gold?

423
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,790
What? Do you think you are not worth that?

424
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Of course I am.

425
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,790
You're asking for too little!

426
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,440
Think about it. Other than those fees,

427
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,310
all these years,

428
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,240
I've broken many things in Tushan. It costs money to repair.

429
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,110
I also have to pay for the damages for patting the foxes so much they are bald.

430
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,960
I also have to compensate for angering Elder.

431
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,590
Along with all the interest,

432
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,900
I don't think it'd be enough even if Wangquan Villa

433
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,630
brings over a mountain of gold.

434
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,720
Are you

435
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,960
trying to be a doctor?

436
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,920
Everyone has their specialty.

437
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,440
I can't treat patients.

438
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,550
I'm experimenting for a new braise seasoning.

439
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,000
I only cook grilled chicken, boiled chicken, and shredded chicken porridge all day long.

440
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,530
Anyone would be tired of it.

441
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,180
I'm trying something new: braised grilled chicken.

442
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,640
Braised grilled chicken?

443
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,310
You're so calm.

444
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,720
Now that your identity is exposed,

445
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,830
many fox spirits in Tushan

446
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,310
are looking to attack you.

447
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,420
Aren't you worried at all?

448
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,090
Does worrying help?

449
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,680
It doesn't...

450
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,920
But–

451
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,780
Instead of being anxious all day,

452
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,340
I might as well do what I'm supposed to,

453
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,810
and many things will be solved naturally.

454
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,630
You mean...

455
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,920
Don't worry.

456
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,310
Ever since I entered Tushan,

457
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,760
I knew this day would come.

458
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,700
Is this today's medicine?

459
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,270
The wound in your aorta is serious.

460
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,870
Dongfang Spiritual Blood is not ordinary too.

461
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,270
If anything goes wrong, it will backfire easily.

462
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,010
Chief has checked

463
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,270
this prescription over and over with me.

464
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
This medicine is made with 9 grams of Ten-thousand-year Ice Heart,

465
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,290
13 grams of Thousand-Year Flame Stone,

466
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,970
and the merging of ice and fire

467
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,400
with spirit power.

468
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,000
You’re lucky.

469
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
Chief doesn't normally

470
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,260
ask too much about prescriptions.

471
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
It must be expensive.

472
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,810
Not just expensive.

473
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,750
This

474
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,790
is a treasure so rare

475
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,470
that it's priceless.

476
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,440
Then give me this medicine every day.

477
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,900
You're trying to owe Tushan so much money.

478
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,640
Are you trying to stay here forever?

479
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,110
Cui Yuling, be a good person.

480
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,010
There's no need to spell it out.

481
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,530
Lady Fairy.

482
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,200
You haven't recovered yet.

483
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Why did they send you to serve the water?

484
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,670
The medical expenses in Tushan are really high.

485
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,920
I need to work more to pay my debt.

486
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,110
I smell blood.

487
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,210
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

488
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,690
I am recovering a little slowly.

489
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
It seems that Cui Yuling's medicine

490
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
is not as magical as they say.

491
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,590
If she hears this,

492
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,860
she's going to raise the price of your medicine.

493
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,920
That'd be the best.

494
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,680
Lady Fairy, have a seat.

495
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Give me your hand.

496
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,920
You're so careful.

497
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,940
This water is made of gold?

498
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,040
It's more expensive than gold.

499
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,000
So can you raise

500
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,110
my salary?

501
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,180
Ask Rongrong if she agrees.

502
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,210
Since Spirit-Master Kingdom,

503
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,820
Shi Ji hasn't touched

504
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,050
Grief Tree.

505
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,140
Given how she acts,

506
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,860
she won’t just let it go.

507
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,390
But she's in the dark.

508
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,370
Even if we want to look for her,

509
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,230
we won't know where to start from.

510
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,180
Someone

511
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,070
must know where she is.

512
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,030
Jin Renfeng?

513
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,070
That's right.

514
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,880
Jin Renfeng's blood was poisoned.

515
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,160
His Refined Spirit Core is backfiring too.

516
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,820
It's time to put an end to

517
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,200
the grudge between Tushan and him.

518
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,880
But he's so cunning.

519
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,710
Where can I find him?

520
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,350
That would depend on if Yuechu is willing to cooperate.

521
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,480
Yuechu?

522
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,870
You mean to have

523
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,650
Yuechu as a bait again?

524
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,640
I agree.

525
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,550
To kill Jin Renfeng

526
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,750
and avenge my parents

527
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,270
is my lifelong wish.

528
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,910
Besides,

529
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,310
Tushan has raised me for so many years.

530
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,040
It's time for me to contribute.

531
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,940
This operation is quite risky.

532
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,440
Are you sure?

533
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,620
Why do you keep reminding me?

534
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,750
Am I such a coward

535
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,510
in your eyes?

536
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,680
Don't worry. I promised you.

537
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,060
I won't let anyone who cares about me worry anymore.

538
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,840
You're running away without saying anything?

539
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,750
I'm running away. Why would I say anything?

540
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,350
Do you want to be caught by that vixen with terrible temper

541
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,510
and be beaten up?

542
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,030
Even so,

543
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,110
it's so embarrassing

544
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,570
to just run away like this.

545
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Do you have money?

546
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,040
If you don't what are you going on about?

547
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,110
Even if the people Tushan don't kill you,

548
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,170
they will use the ledger to crush you.

549
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,270
They will capture you to be a slave.

550
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,580
They hate people from Divine Flame Villa the most.

551
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,520
People like you

552
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,760
would be the lowest level slave.

553
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,960
Are you talking about yourself?

554
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,360
All I've heard about you

555
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,340
in Tushan these days are bad things.

556
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,800
Things like you hid your identity and refused to leave Tushan.

557
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,660
You even played tricks to get people to pay up. Also–

558
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,140
Shut up!

559
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,390
I won't think you're a mute if you don't speak.

560
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,390
You're the mute!

561
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,530
Sister!

562
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,880
Sister!

563
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,000
Bad news.

564
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,280
The woman from Divine Flame Villa ran away.

565
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,760
What?

566
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,010
Yuechu ran away with Fu Cheng?

567
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,470
Yes.

568
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,200
I searched the entire Tushan before I came here.

569
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,330
I didn't even find a single cockroach.

570
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,930
He must have escaped knowing that his identity

571
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:31,930
has been exposed.

572
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,400
This darn Dongfang Yuechu!

573
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,060
I was going to spare your life.

574
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:36,920
How dare you help someone

575
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,270
of Divine Flame Villa to escape?

576
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,840
Be quiet.

577
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,680
You two, follow me to Huguang Pavilion.

578
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,810
Liusheng, you too.

579
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,110
I have reminded over and over that

580
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,630
that brat is cunning and can't be trusted.

581
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,320
But none of you believed me.

582
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,270
You fed them and treated them so well.

583
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,310
Look at it now.

584
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:00,750
We raised a bastard

585
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,160
who betrayed us.

586
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,000
Please calm down, Elder.

587
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
The most important thing now is to capture him first.

588
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,600
But the world is vast.

589
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,219
Where can we find this brat?

590
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,550
Where else can he go?

591
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,510
He must have gone back to Divine Flame Villa

592
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,150
to inherit his position seeing that Jin Renfeng is severely injured.

593
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,320
When I catch him,

594
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,659
I'll skin him alive!

595
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,159
Yuechu has been doing his best for so many years,

596
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,500
so that one day,

597
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,600
he can take Divine Flame Villa back from Jin REnfeng.

598
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,909
He wants to inherit Divine Flame Villa?

599
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,280
He fools around all day long.

600
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,320
He doesn't look like

601
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,920
someone who is so ambitious.

602
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,780
If you could tell,

603
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,340
how could he hide in Tushan for so many years?

604
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,320
Kid, you can't judge people by their appearance.

605
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,630
Humans are vicious.

606
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,320
They are two-faced.

607
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,170
People who look like they don't work hard

608
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,199
actually work extra hard behind closed doors.

609
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,400
People who look harmless actually have evil intentions.

610
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,960
These are common.

611
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,290
I'm not bragging.

612
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,190
I'm good at

613
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,400
reading people.

614
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,150
I didn't like him from the beginning.

615
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,960
All right.

616
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,870
Since everyone thinks that

617
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,510
he has fled to Divine Flame Villa,

618
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,510
we have to take action immediately.

619
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,110
Yaya, Lai,

620
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,550
stay in Tushan.

621
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,800
Liusheng and Elder,

622
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,840
come with me to Divine Flame Villa to get them.

623
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,500
-Yes.
-Yes.

624
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,710
Master!

625
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,510
If we still don't get the spiritual blood,

626
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,170
I’m afraid…

627
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,460
Master,

628
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,630
I heard a rumor in the forest

629
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,110
from passing spirits

630
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,840
that Tushan Honghong is leading a group of fox spirits

631
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,500
to hunt down Dongfang Yuechu.

632
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,410
Could it be Tushan is taking revenge on Divine Flame Villa?

633
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,440
You're right.

634
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,840
Dongfang Yuechu thought

635
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
he could protect himself by giving Tushan

636
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,840
his blood from his heart.

637
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,320
But he didn't think about how

638
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,110
the spirits of Tushan

639
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:01,710
wouldn't be able to tolerate a descendant of Divine Flame Villa.

640
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,360
Master,

641
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,840
I’ll go investigate Dongfang Yuechu's movements.

642
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,630
Take care.

643
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,970
Okay.

644
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,840
Tushan is hunting down Yuechu?

645
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,440
It's said that Yuechu escaped,

646
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,830
infuriating Tushan.

647
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,630
That's why he is being hunted down.

648
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,430
A few days ago,

649
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,630
Tushan refused to release Yuechu

650
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,030
with the excuse of alimony.

651
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,890
Obviously, they want to keep him.

652
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,360
But what for?

653
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,950
That I don't understand.

654
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,400
If they're trying to use this to threaten Yiqi Alliance,

655
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,600
they could have done that a few days ago.

656
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,030
If they are after Dongfang's bloodline,

657
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
they could've done it decades ago.

658
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,230
But why have they never harmed Yuechu,

659
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,480
and why has he escaped now?

660
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,440
I'm afraid it's not as simple as it seems.

661
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,960
Inform those who are

662
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,510
lying in wait around Divine Flame Villa to

663
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,110
not act rashly immediately.

664
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,880
Also,

665
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,760
report to me if anything happens.

666
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,670
Yes.

667
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,630
Huaizhu.

668
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,920
If we can get Yuechu to return,

669
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,120
it's also accomplishing

670
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,110
your unfinished will.

671
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,350
Jin Renfeng has many disciples.

672
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,510
I'm afraid he'll find us soon.

673
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,240
He's like a frightened bird now.

674
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,230
He wouldn't dare to show up easily.

675
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,840
As long as I can get to Divine Flame Villa successfully,

676
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,510
I will have a way to deal with him.

677
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,360
What is it?

678
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,520
You're in the mood to roast rabbits

679
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,920
while you're still escaping?

680
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,320
You really underestimated my nose.

681
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Dongfang Yuechu!

682
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,400
You took away people from Divine Flame Villa on your own accord,

683
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,000
and that's already an unforgivable sin.

684
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,130
If you still think you are from Tushan,

685
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,860
go back with Chief

686
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,030
or you will suffer!

687
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,280
Go back?

688
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,700
I will die if I go back.

689
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,880
Cut the crap. Take him down first.
