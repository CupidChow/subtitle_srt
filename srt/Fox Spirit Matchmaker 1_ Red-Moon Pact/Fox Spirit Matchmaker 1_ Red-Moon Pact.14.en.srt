79
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,270
I mean,

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
something very special

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
and unique,

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,510

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,020
No. Why?

91
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,930
Can you watch the store for me?

92
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,250
What about you?

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,870
Me?

94

That's 20 taels.

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Plus the money I earned before,

99
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,430
I'm already out of debt.

100
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,960

Hurry up.

113
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,430
Your puppets are dilly-dallying.

114
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,120
It's irritating.

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Exactly.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll play with you.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,870
Great!

118
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640

119
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,000

120
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,870
Play.

121
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,220
Great!

122
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,720
You're the chief of Tushan,

123
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,350
but you're also just a normal spirit.

124
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,940
You have blood, flesh, a heart, and feelings.

125
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,590
You may also get hurt.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,120
You can also feel cold, hot, and lonely.

127
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,660
You're protecting everyone.

128
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,120
But who's protecting you?

129
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,840
In this world,

130
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,480
there's gotta be someone

131
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,820
who protects you like you protect Tushan.

132
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,020
Lady Fairy, are you alright?

133
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,500
Lady Fairy, don't go with him!

134

Lady Fairy,

135

136
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,540
we saw the sunset together in the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

137
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,750
Next time, let's go to see snow-capped mountains,

138
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,630
lush forests,

139
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,880
and the moonlit river.

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,990
There are many beautiful views in the world.

141

00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,620
shall we?

143
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,620
Lady Fairy,

144
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,280
I want to see seasons change with you,

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
to wander on green hills with you

146
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
in the moonlight.

147
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,510

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,400
Great.

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
Buddy,

150
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,390
you're apparently a rookie.

151
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,920
Yeah.

152
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,000
The best part about romantic love

153
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,730
is the pushing and pulling.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,680
Right?

155
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,520
You can't rush things.

156
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,210
Yeah.

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
You're so inexperienced.

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,070
That old man said

159
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,640
I can't rush things.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,789
Great!

161
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,360
Lady Fairy, hurry.

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Sir.

163
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,720
Two bowls of glutinous rice balls.

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,120
Okay.

165
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,860
Have a seat first.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,220
Okay.

167
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:45,870
Sit.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,870
Your glutinous rice balls.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Here's the money.

170
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,750
Thank you.

171
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,510
Lady Fairy,

172
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,750
I know you don't like human food.

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,870
But try this.

174
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,510
How is it?

175
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,360
Very sweet.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Tasty, right?

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,240
When I came to the market with my parents as a kid,

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,750
they'd always buy me rice balls.

179
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,540
Once,

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,630
Dad lost his wallet

181
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,810
and didn't buy me them.

182
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,310
I kept crying,

183
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,960
and Dad was scolded by Mom for a long while.

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Your parents

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
must love each other deeply.

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,020
My dad was henpecked.

187
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,160
He was very afraid of my mom.

188
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,120
But when my mom was in danger,

189
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,960
nothing could daunt him.

190
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,200
Roasted chestnuts!

191
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,530
Lady Fairy, wait for me.

192
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,860
♫When my gaze passes through the long night♫

193
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
I'd like some.

194
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,880

Sir,

242
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,010
is the boy with you?

243
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,450
Yes.

244
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,400
He's my grandson.

245
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,370
A very sweet boy.

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,240
He offered to help me.

247
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,520
Where's the rest of your family?

248
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,540
His parents

249
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,450
were killed by spirits.

250
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,820
Killed by spirits?

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,320
Spirit attacks are common.

252
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,560
My son and daughter-in-law

253
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,840
were unlucky

254
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,510
and ran into them.

255
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,550
That boy and I

256
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,950
only have each other now.

257
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,720
I didn't know

258
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,380
spirits inflicted such pain on humans.

259
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,240
Lady Fairy,

260
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,860
don't blame yourself.

261
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,910
With the Spirit Alliance in charge,

262
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,840
things will get better and better.

263
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,360
Your blood poison has worsened,

264
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,100
and you've lost the Divine Flame.

265
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,620
How dare you send a message to disturb me?

266
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,210
I mentioned Refined Spirit Pills in the message.

267
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,270
Have you brought one with you?

268
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,120
This is the last Refined Spirit Pill in the world.

269
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,090
It can restore your Divine Fire to its peak state.

270
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,510
But I must remind you,

271
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,870
once you take this pill,

272
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,270
you need to replenish spiritual blood in time,

273
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,900
or your heart and lungs will give out,

274
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,030
and you'll become a cripple.

275
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,850
I can

276
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,830
relieve your pain for now.

277
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,440
Think it over.

278
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,790
Instead of living in hell like this,

279
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,720
I'd rather roll the dice.

280
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,640
Don't regret it.

282
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,450
Director.

283
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,800
Have you found out who sent that message

284
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,440
when you were in Beishan?

285
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,070
No.

286
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,150
It seems that person doesn't want to be found,

287
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,120
so I didn't find anything.

288
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,510
However,

289
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,000
during the recent chaos at Beishan,

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,490
Tushan's chief took advantage of it to establish the Spirit Alliance.

291
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,410
It seems poised to compete with the Yiqi Alliance.

292
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,670
Over the years,

293
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,820
tension has been building

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
between humans and spirits.

295
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,910
But the spirits at Tushan

296
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,910
have stayed disciplined

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,700
and never hurt any humans.

298
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,850
Have your men keep an eye on them.

299
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,300
Don't act rashly.

300
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,960
Yes.

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,120

Why hasn't it been fixed?

305
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,510
A lot of mosquitoes came in last night.

306
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,910
They almost ate me alive.

307
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,120
Look.

308
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,390
They're everywhere.

309
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Of course I can have it fixed.

310
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,450
But you need to pay.

311
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,000
Rongrong, I'm begging you.

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Can you put it on my tab?

313
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,870
No.

314
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,030
You left the shop unattended and came back,

315
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,120
causing Tushan to lose the money we put in.

316
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,720
I haven't even settled that score with you yet.

317
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,000
You're so stingy.

318
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
Can't you show a bit of humanity?

319
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm a fox. How would I have humanity?

320
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,050
Besides,

321
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,510
didn't you get a bundle of firewood from the kitchen?

322
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,390
Light it to create smoke.

323
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,910
It can drive mosquitoes away.

324
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,390
Start a fire in this hot weather?

325
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,080
Do you want to roast me alive?

326
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,720
Rongrong.

327
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,290

333
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,640

I can't hide anything from you.

335
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,160
There are lotus seeds and lily bulbs in it.

336
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,530
They help beat the heat.

337
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,070
What's wrong?

338
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
It's awful?

339
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,000
It's great.

340
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,360
How have I never noticed

343
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,160
how naughty and cunning you are?

344
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,380
No wonder people call a sly person an old fox.

345
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,750
As the chief of Tushan,

346
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,570
you're the most cunning.

347
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,920
You're easy to fool,

348
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,360
which is not my fault.

349
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,360
Why are you saying that?

350
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,660
It's written on your face.

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,140
Why are you so nervous?

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,680

No.

The view from your mini pavilion

374
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,470
is quite good.

I know what Yaya and the others want.

It's not open

383
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,620
to any woman.

384
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,790
Sorry.

385
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,590
I don't want your apology.

386
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,590
You like being Tushan's little sidekick, don't you?

387
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,720
Go on then.

388
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:53,850
I refuse.

389
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,130
First, I've grown up.

390
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,070
Second,

391
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,170
I'm able to protect you now.

392
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,310
Third,

393
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,700
I'm not a sidekick.

394
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm your perfect match.

395
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,260
Knock it off.

396
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,640
Wait for me here.

397
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,680
Last winter,

398
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,270
I went to great lengths to preserve a bucket of ice pop,

399
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,310
thinking I could enjoy them in summer

400
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,750
to beat the heat.

401
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,050
Tushan Yaya!

402
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,350
You thief!

403
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,500
It's for me?

404
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,680
Try it.

405
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,450
It looks good.

406
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,830
There's osmanthus honey in it?

407
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes.

408
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,170
Yuechu tried so hard to hide it,

409
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,510
so I knew it must be something great.

410
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,440
I guessed right.

411
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,110
Isn't it tastier than those sold at the market?

412
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,470
It's indeed tasty.

413
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,610
But there's no such thing as a free lunch.

414
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Tell me.

415
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,200
You want something from me, don't you?

416
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,510
Well,

417
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,370
can you teach me

418
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,460
how to conjure things out of thin air?

419
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,920
It's not for my benefit.

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want to teach it to the other foxes.

421
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,770
Didn't I already agree

422
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,750
to teach you?

423
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,170
But that's an amazing skill.

424
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,100
Are you really going to teach them?

425
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,210
I think they need to become more powerful.

426
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,200
So I'll teach them

427
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,420
all the skills I have.

428
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,270
Not bad.

429
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,210
[Secrets of Cultivation]

430
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,040
What's this?

431
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,400
Open it.

432
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,230
Secrets of Cultivation?

433
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,260
It's so long.

434
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,280
This one throws out four punches in one go.

435
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,200
Look at this.

436
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,830
Elder?

437
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,300
It's late, Elder. Why are you still up?

438
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,160
I want to ask you that too.

439
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,170
It's so late, yet you're still up.

440
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,400
Where have you been?

441
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,160
Since when do I have to

442
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,970
report my whereabouts to you?

443
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,160
Chief, I don't mean to nag you,

444
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,550
but it's only been days since you took Yuechu to open a store

445
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,440
in the human world.

446
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,100
Why have you brought him back?

447
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,270
Have you forgotten everything I said?

448
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,930
Are you going to leave Tushan in the lurch?

449
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,220
How dare you doubt my devotion to Tushan?

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
Then, Chief, you must give me

451
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,750
an explanation today.

452
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,090
What kind of explanation do you want?

453
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,100
Chief,

454
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,430
set aside other things for now.

455
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,520
That she-devil has returned

456
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,310
and is determined to fight to the death with Tushan.

457
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,200
At this time,

458
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,160
how can you fail your own kind

459
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,790
for a human boy?

460
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,680
Moreover, he's a descendant of the Dongfang family.

461
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,440
Chief.

462
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,580
Have you forgotten

463
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,440
why you took him back to Tushan back then?

464
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,160
I remember

465
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,690
everything I should remember.

466
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,440
It's late.

467
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,200
Go back and rest if there's nothing else.

468
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,900
Chief,

469
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,070
I know

470
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,500
you look cold

471
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,010
but are actually softhearted.

472
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,670
I also know

473
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,630
you've been very lonely these years.

474
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,560
But Dongfang Yuechu

475
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,870
is not the right one for you.

476
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,160
Tushan Yaya!

477
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Tushan Yaya!

478
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,750
Brat, are you crazy?

479
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,900
What did you call me?

480
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,240
Yaya.

481
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,740
I've saved those ice pops for half a year,

482
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,310
not eating a single one of them,

483
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,570
yet you stole them all!

484
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,030
I…

485
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,400
I gave you a watermelon in return, didn't I?

486
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,510
This is called barter.

487
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,310
Barter?

488
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,170
What book is this?

489
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,060
Absolute Zero?

490
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,790
Give it back!

491
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,720
No.

492
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,060
Return my ice pops.

493
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,140
You brat…

494
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,060
Fine, fine.

495
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,300
I'll give it back.

496
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,080
Can you teach me this move?

497
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,130
I know you are the most powerful member

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,870

499
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,310
Please teach me that move.

500
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,840
Give it back!

501
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,590
Fine. Here you are.

502
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,830
Teach me. Teach me.

503
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,330
Silly.

504
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,550
You should say I'm the most powerful after Honghong.

505
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,960
Fine, whatever you say.

506
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,110
Teach me now.

507
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,830
No.

508
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,200
Please teach me, Yaya.

509
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,790
No.

510
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,800
Then let me read that book.

511
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,620
Yaya!

[Divine Flame Villa]

513
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,400
Master.

514
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,040
Have you spread the word?

515
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,350
Yes.

516
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,310
Hearing that a Dongfang boy appeared,

517
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,680
many small sects in the Yiqi Alliance

518
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,270
started taking action secretly.

519
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,890
They claim to kill the evil spirits at Tushan,

520
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,350
but in fact, they're after spiritual blood.

521
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,510
Let them dream on for now.

522
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,570
After I use them to wipe out Tushan,

523
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,850
no one can take that boy away from me.

524
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,810
You didn't alert

525
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,210
the Wangquan family, did you?

526
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,420
Rest assured, Master.

527

Wangquan Hongye's relationship with the Dongfang family

528
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,110
is known to everyone.

529
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,850
Since those guys want spiritual blood,

530
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,380
they won't invite trouble.

531
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,040
Everything's fine with the Grief Tree.

532
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,160
It seems that Shi Ji has been quiet recently.

In the battle at Beishan,

534
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,020
she must have been badly wounded.

535
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,020
But she's been scheming for so long.

536
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
She won't easily give up.

537
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,830
You've looked into the force behind her.

538
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,250
Have you found anything?

539
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,160
I've checked the Nan Kingdom, Aolai, and Beishan

540
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
but didn't find any suspicious forces.

541
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm still investigating.

542
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,470
The spies sent out by Tushan

543
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,200
failed to find her hideout too.

544
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,080
Looks like she's very careful this time.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
You've been here for so long.

546
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,610
Has anything happened over there?

547
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,000
No.

548
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,790
At present, nothing is more important

549
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,250
than getting rid of Shi Ji.

550
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,830
Yaya is an innocent girl.

551
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,360
I don't want her to get hurt.

552
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,170
Don't worry, Chief.

553
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,790
I won't hurt Yaya.

554
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,240
Neither will I let anyone hurt her.

555
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,550
Tushan is not far from here.

556
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,880
I wonder if the rumor about the Dongfang boy

557
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,010
is true or not.

558
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,970
I heard Divine Flame Villa has taken action too.

559
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
It should be true.

560
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,210
After we catch that boy,

561
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
let's make him marry a dozen girls

562
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,400
to give birth to many Dongfang girls.

563
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,320
One

564
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,680
for each of us.

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,840

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,590

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,670
No, we're surrounded!

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
Watch out!

571
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,790
These butterflies are weird.

572
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,160
Stop slashing them.

573
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,310
Try to find cover.

574
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Divine Flame.

575
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,070
Purest Sun Flame.

576
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,110
Thank you for saving us, Jin.

577
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,640
We were going to Tushan to kill evil spirits.

578
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,270
If you hadn't come to our rescue,

579
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,270
we would've been killed by those strange butterflies.

580
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,000
Silver butterflies are lethal.

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,830
Tushan often uses sorcery to conjure them.

582
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,310
The infected die instantly,

583
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,090
without exception.

584
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,920
Those spirits at Tushan

585
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,720
are so cruel and vicious.

586
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,390
When we get to Tushan,

587
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,510
we must kill as many spirits as we can!

588
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,030
Yes.

589
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,510
Kill those spirits!

590
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,440
Tushan is a treacherous place.

591
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,170
Why don't we take the trail and go there together?

592
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,540
That's exactly what we think.

593
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,350
We're grateful to have your help.

594
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,770
You're welcome.

595
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,110
Let's set off.

596
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,310
If we travel with him,

597
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,550
what about that Dongfang boy?

598
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,960
Jin Renfeng has high cultivation.

599
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,960
With him around,

600
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,790
Tushan spirits can be distracted,

601
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,030
which will give us a chance to get that boy.

602
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,310
After we catch him,

603
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,830
getting his blood

604
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,260
will be easy as pie.

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,530
Let's go.

606
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,200
Master has used silver butterflies

607
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,830
to gain the trust of those sect leaders.

608
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,090
Destroy the remaining butterflies now.

609
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,320
What are you waiting for? Do it!

610
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,510
Brat, be careful!

611
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,640
Elder!

612
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,360
You almost burned my beard.

613
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,440
Sorry, Elder.

614
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,970
Just now, I heard

615
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,750
a beast passing by.

616
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,310
I was worried that it might hurt the foxes,

617
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,830
so I…

618
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,280
I almost hurt you by mistake.

619
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,670
-I'm so sorry.
-Wait.

620
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,200
Beast? What beast?

621
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
Didn't you hear that?

622
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,830
It kept grunting just now,

623
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,960
like a boar.

624
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,070
That sound was terrible.

625
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,510
I didn't hear any grunting.

626
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,200
Brat, stop talking nonsense.

627
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,070
Fine, fine.

628
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,960
You're right.

629
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,600
What can I do for you, Elder?

630
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,030
Dongfang Yuechu,

631
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm warning you.

632
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,490
Stay away from Chief.

633
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,430
You're from the Dongfang family.

634
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,310
Tushan…

635
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,840
Stop.

636
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,070
Old fox,

637
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,720
I told you to stay out of this.

638
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,310
Lady Fairy, don't be so serious.

639
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,640
You may scare Jiaojiao.

640
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,990
Jiaojiao, leave.

641
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,000
Lady Fairy, why are you so angry?

642
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,170
You know what Elder Buzui is like.

643
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,310
He tried to kill you,

644
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,340
and now he's here warning you.

645
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,000
Don't you feel wronged?

646
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,860
Being scolded is better than being ignored.

647
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Besides,

648
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,440
although he often scolds me,

649
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,030
I've stolen his wine many times.

650
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,090
So, in the end, he's lost more than me.

651
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,880
That's it?

652
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,040
He's a nagging old man,

653
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,520
but he just wants the best for Tushan.

654
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,030
I don't want you to have conflicts

655
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,350
with him because of me.

656
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,920
Recently,

657
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,470
your cultivation has improved a lot.

658
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,930
I want to elevate my Purest Sun Flame

659
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,530
to level 3 as soon as possible

660
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,510
so that I can make better magic tools

661
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,910
and send them to Shi Kuan.

662
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Dongfang Yuechu,

663
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,270
please get prepared in advance

664
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,730
after getting my message.

665
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,920
Kill Jin Renfeng!

666
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,000
Bitch,

667
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,840
how dare you betray Master?

668
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,240
When we caught Dongfang Yuechu last time,

669
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
something felt off about you.

670
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,640
Today, I caught you red-handed.

671
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,910
I've been thinking about

672
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,030
who gave that brat

673
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,700
the Fire Candle that day.

674
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,200
It turns out to be you.

675
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,080
After being my blood bag for so many years,

676
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,350
you must hate my guts, don't you?

677
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,640
Kill me.

678
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,920
Kill you?

679
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,630
Isn't that too easy for you?

680
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,440
You want to tip that brat off, don't you?

681
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,200
That's what I want too.

682
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,070
Don’t forget you're poisoned with Sorrowful Tears.

683
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,400
I have a thousand ways

684
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,710
to make you wish

685
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,150
you were dead.

686
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,150
Tushan fox spirits

687
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,710
are cruel and cunning.

688
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,980
We have to strike first.

689
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,800
I've set the bait.

690
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,889
Let's wait for them to bite it.

691
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,110
We're all at your disposal.

692
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,630
Divine Flame Villa has been planning this for a long time.

693
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,030
We've devised a formation to kill spirits.

694
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,290
Hundreds of years ago,

695
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,010
the Villa used the Red Lotus Formation

696
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,489
to greatly weaken Tushan.

697
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,100
Today, we'll use that formation again.

698
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,630
Divine Flame Villa's disciples

699
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,960
will set up the formation outside Tushan.

700
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,000
You'll stay in the formation with me

701
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,290
to fight the enemies.

702
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,840
With such cooperation,

703
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,490
we can definitely destroy Tushan with this formation.

704
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,810
Your Purest Sun Flame has improved again.

705
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,990
Without you practicing with me,

706
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,700
I wouldn't have made it.

707
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,590
Thank you,

708
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,120
Lady Fairy.

709
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,880
Honghong.

710
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,230
A lookout said

711
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,180
Jin Renfeng and the Yiqi Alliance's disciples

712
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,580
have gathered in the woods outside Tushan.

713
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,630
Meet you outside Tushan

714
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,760
at noon today.

715
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,320
It's about something important.

716
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,280
Love, Fu Cheng.

717
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,270
Fu Cheng asked to see me outside Tushan.

718
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,490
It's weird.

719
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,430
She's never been so friendly to me.

720
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,960
Why is this message so cheesy?

721
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,570
Love, Fu Cheng?

722
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm afraid Fu Cheng is exposed,

723
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,760
and the one who sent this message is Jin Renfeng.

724
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,490
I'll go out to check things out.

725
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,290
Go find Lai to save Fu Cheng.

726
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,030
Tushan Honghong.

727
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,550
Dongfang Yuechu.

728
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,280
Today,

729
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,400
I'll in no way let you escape.

730
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,960
Jin Renfeng.

731
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,550
You did too many bad things.

732
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,550
You brought all this upon yourself.

733
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,930
You ruined my plan again and again.

734
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,280
I'll give you another chance today.

735
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,360
Hand over Dongfang Yuechu,

736
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,670
or I'll make you wish you had never been born!

737
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,510
That's my line.

738
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,090
Gentlemen, thank you for coming all the way here

739
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,400
to help me activate the formation.

740
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,000
Red Lotus Formation.
