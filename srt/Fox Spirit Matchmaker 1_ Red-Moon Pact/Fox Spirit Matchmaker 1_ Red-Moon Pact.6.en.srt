Lady Fairy.

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,680
You plan to extract your spirit bone and rebuild the Grief Tree's heart.

6
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,370
I disagree.

7
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,690
This has nothing to do with you.

8
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,750
Why not?

9
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,630
I'm your sidekick

10
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,240
I won't allow you to risk your life.

11
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,520
That was just

12
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,470
an excuse for you to stay in Tushan when you were young.

13
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,070
You've grown up.

14
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,690
You don't have to live here anymore.

15
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,200
Even so, I disagree.

16
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,960
You're the Chief of Tushan.

17
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,920
You can't sacrifice yourself.

18
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
If the current you

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
return to the Hulu Village16 years ago,

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
what would you do?

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,140
You would do your best to protect your parents

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
and the village.

23
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,310
You wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice yourself.

24
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,890
That's the case for me, too.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
To me, Tushan

26
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,320
is not just my responsibility.

27
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,270
There are so many spirits

28
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,000
living an honest life here.

29
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,780
All the memories of this land

30
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,240
are inseparable from my life.

31
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm willing to protect it,

32
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,710
no matter what it takes.

33
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,630
Moreover, it's not completely bad for me

34
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,370
to use my spirit bone

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,360
to rebuild the Grief Tree's heart.

36
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,630
If more lovers

37
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,890
meet under the Grief Tree in the future,

38
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,890
the Grief Tree will be revitalized,

39
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,150
and my power will also increase.

40
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,860
But now,

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,960
the Grief Tree's heart has been corroded by the Dark Force.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
It's not easy to make a new couple.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Everything is possible.

44
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,280
I've made up my mind.

45
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,810
No need to persuade me.

46
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Chief,

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,250
to take the spirit bone,

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,420
you need to first remove your spirit power.

49
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,960
The pain is unbearable.

50
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,300
I really can't...

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,000
Leave.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,700
Let Rongrong do it.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,600
I'll do it.

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,580
I'll protect Lady Fairy.

55
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,150
No.

56
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm going to succeed.

57
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,000
No one can stop me!

58
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,430
Oh no.

59
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,070
The spirit bone has left its host.

60
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,160
Lady Fairy's remaining power

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,420
is not enough to support the spirit bone.

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,800

Although the spirit bone stabilized the Grief Tree,

69
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,900
the power I've extracted

70
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,670
is enough to make me a new body.

71
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,950
Though I'm not as strong as I was in my prime,

72
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,270

and settle all our scores.

76

Both humans and spirits

78
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,960

Although the leech spirits are good at healing,

Lady Fairy extracted her spirit bone this time.

87

It's no small deal.

I believe in Cui Yuling.

89

She became the leader of the leech spirits

90
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,720
because of her impressive healing skills.

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,250
I also believe in Honghong.

92
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,250

Not dead?

108
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,510
Then why were you shaking your head and sighing?

109
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,320
Even if I shake my head and sigh, it doesn't mean someone died.

110

don't blame them anymore.

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,050
on everything myself.

134
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,960

I just don't understand

140
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,890
why you hid

141

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
would you stop me?

144
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,200
Of course I will.

145
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
That's why I can't tell you.

146
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,480
But Honghong,

147
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,720
that's the spirit bone.

148
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,200
Every spirit only has one spirit bone.

149
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,040
Remember,

150
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,900
as the chief of Tushan,

151
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,040
nothing is more important than protecting Tushan

152
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,830
and the Grief Tree,

153
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,750
even my life.

154
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,530
But...

155
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
No buts.

156
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,960
Every spirit is born with a different talent.

157
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,510
The strong should not be conquering,

158
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,840
but to protect.

159
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,320
The three of us were born from the Grief Tree.

160
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,920
We were born more talented than other spirits.

161
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,300
That means

162
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,700
we need to shoulder more responsibilities.

163
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,020
Go.

Do you regret it?

167
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,000
As the Chief,

168
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,840
am I worrying everyone too much?

169
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,210
You not only worry us,

170
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,910
but you also annoy us.

171
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,010
Think about it.

172
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,920
You're shouldering so much burden yourself.

173
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,370
If you really...

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,180
If something happens to you,

175
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
someone has to shoulder those things for you.

176
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,300
Just for that,

177
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,000
you have to take good care of yourself.

178
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,330
When did you learn to educate people?

179
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,420
You can educate others,

180
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,570
but others can't educate you?

181
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,480
How about

182
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,650
I invite the Elder here

183
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,980
and ask him to nag you instead?

184
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,020
I promise you.

Rongrong will take care of me.

193
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,970
Okay.

194
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,750
I'll visit you later.

195
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,990
Rongrong, I'm counting on you.

196
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,960
Don't you think that

197
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,440
Yuechu treats you differently?

198
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,460
That's just because since young,

199
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,300
he was afraid of being kicked out of Tushan,

200
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,460
so he called himself my sidekick

201
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,230
to get closer to us.

202
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,150
That's not what I meant.

203
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,600
Fine.

204
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,710
Putting aside what Yuechu thinks,

205
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,120
what do you think?

206
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,360
You even lost your spirit bone

207
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,780
to save him this time.

208
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,080
I told you.

209
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,270
Yuechu is innocent.

210
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,430
Are there no other reasons?

211
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,380
During the matchmaking event,

212
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,490
Yuechu risked his life to

213
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,480
enter the nightmare to save me.

214
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,900
I owe him one.

215
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
So,

216
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,840
as long as there is another choice,

217
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,130
I won't sacrifice him.

218
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,870
That's all?

219
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,350
What about this time?

220
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,720
Why did you ask Yuechu to protect you?

221
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,580
That's because the Elder chickened out.

222
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,840
Even if that's the case,

223
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,820
there are so many powerful spirits in Tushan,

224
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,550
why did you

225
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,140
entrust your life

226
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,050
to Yuechu without a thought?

227
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,450
Putting aside the fact that he's human,

228
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,240
for the past thousand years,

229
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,720
you have never trusted

230
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
in any man this way.

231
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,080
I don't think it's just because

232
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,740
he has spiritual blood on him.

233
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,840
[Tushan Academy]

234
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,100
Yaya, wait for me.
[Tushan Academy]

235
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,170
[Tushan Academy]

236
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:37,400
Stop following me.
[Tushan Academy]

237
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,340
Stop following me.

238
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,190
Are you still angry?

239
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,700
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

240
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,460
It was Honghong's order.

241
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,860
I had no choice.

242
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,920
Yes, you had no choice.

243
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,100
As long as you understand.

244
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,160
Didn't you understand everything already?

245
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,490
Why are you still angry?

246
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,790
Understanding doesn't mean forgiveness.

247
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,520
Anyway, don't come to me again.

248
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,310
I...

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,880
No way.

250
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,400
I brought you something good today.

251
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,460
Look.

252
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,280
This is a rare portrait of Sanshao.

253
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,240
[Beyond the East Sea, among the curtain of water, he who the deities bow down to]
[Aolai Sanshao]
This is a rare portrait of Sanshao.

254
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,450
This is a rare portrait of Sanshao.

255
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,930
You can't get this from the market.

256
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,030
Also,

257
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,640
this is Sanshao's special seal.

258
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,250
It’s just a portrait.

259
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,130
You don't have to be too thankful.

260
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
What's wrong?

261
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,750
Don't give me

262
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,450
things like this anymore.

263
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,550
Why?

264
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,380
You don't like it anymore?

265
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,730
It's exactly because I always

266
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,890
focus on these meaningless things

267
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,940
that I neglected to care for Tushan.

268
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,910
I didn't even notice that the Grief Tree was in trouble.

269
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,860
If I had realized earlier,

270
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Honghong wouldn't need to sacrifice her spirit bone.

271
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,830
All right, don't be sad.

272
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,030
Try it.

273
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,640
This is much better than the portrait.

274
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,810
You're so glib-tongued.

275
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,710
Actually, what you just said

276
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,920
isn't your fault.

277
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,820
It's all the mastermind's plot.

278
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,560
Shouldn't I share more of Honghong's burden?

279
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,670
It's not too late to start now.

280
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,400
Really?

281
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,720
Of course.

282
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,370
Although I don’t like Sanshao,

283
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,760
but as far as I know,

284
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,040
he also used to be a

285
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,290
mindless and heedless brat.

286
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,680
He went through hardships and challenges,

287
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
maturing gradually

288
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,400
to become the

289
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,820
respectable person he is now.

290
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,640
Actually, it's normal

291
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,170
to have someone you admire.

292
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,290
But instead of

293
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,790
spending unnecessary time and energy

294
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,190
to collect these things.

295
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,430
Why don't you learn

296
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,520
his most valuable traits

297
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,740
and become better with him?

298
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,450
Okay.

299
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,960
Thank you.

300
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,950
Eat up.

301
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,440
OK.

302
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,120
Candied haws?

303
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,030
Little turtle!

304
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,430
I didn't expect the turtles of Tushan to become spirits too.

305
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,960
They can even send candied haws to people now.

306
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,050
Here.

307
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,800
It's a gift from the little turtle.

308
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,060
It's obviously for you.

309
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,360
You still won't admit it?

310
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,030
Fine.

311
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,040
Thank you.

312
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,440
Little turtle,

313
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,170
Go back and rest after eating.

314
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,410
You had a tiring day of training,

315
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,240
and you're here visiting the Huguang Pavilion at night.

316
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,100
It's my choice.

317
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,400
I can't sleep anyway.

318
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,200
I might as well stay here longer.

319
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,170
I know you're worried about me,

320
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,260
but I'm fine now.

321
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,890
Look.

322
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,630
I can even get the little turtle to send you candied haws now.

323
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,810
What's wrong?

324
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
Nothing.

325
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,690
Go back and rest after eating.

326
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,770
You don't understand.

327
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,960
Honghong aside,

328
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:39,260
Sanshao is the most powerful man in the world.

329
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,570
His level

330
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,830
can’t be understood by a weak

331
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,920
spirit like you.

332
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,860
I was going to go back after settling the Grief Tree.

333
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,930
But now it seems

334
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,340
I need to stay here for a while.

335
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,160
Your tendons and bones have been repositioned.

336
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,550
The external injury will heal in a few days.

337
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,200
Thank you.

338
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,750
Chief,

339
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,750
if you really want to thank me,

340
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,310
I do have a request.

341
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,830
Go ahead.

342
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,760
Many years ago, there was someone

343
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,440
in our clan called Xiaotan.

344
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,030
She was deceived by Jin Renfeng

345
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,880
and helped him

346
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,940
extract the spiritual blood of the Divine Flame Villa's old master.

347
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,870
After that,

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,590
Jin Feng killed Xiaotang

349
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,090
to keep things a secret.

350
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,750
So,

351
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,640
back then, Jin Renfeng

352
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,790
used the leech spirit clan's blood transfusion magic

353
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,320
to get the spiritual blood.

354
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,280
That's right.

355
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,720
So if there is no new blood supply,

356
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,240
the blood in his body will gradually decay.

357
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,000
Although Xiaotan was bewitched by Jin Renfeng and helped the evil,

358
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,070
Jin Renfeng had no right to punish her,

359
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,510
let alone kill her.

360
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,310
Although our clan is good at healing,

361
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,830
we're not good at attacking.

362
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,590
So,

363
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,880
I hope you can

364
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,420
seek justice for Xiaotan.

365
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,920
Don't worry.

366
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,920
Tushan will not let Jin Renfeng go this time.

367
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,070
Then I thank you on behalf of Xiaotan.

368

[Divine Flame Villa]

369
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,980
The battle at the matchmaking event

370
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,380
took half of the spiritual blood in my body.

371
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,310
How can this bit of Divine Flame be enough?

372
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,680
Get out!

373
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,170
Master Jin, you have such a big temper.

374
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,580
Congratulations, Spirit Lord, for regaining your physical body.

375
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,400
You came at the right time, Spirit Lord.

376
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,720
I have a request.

Thank you, Spirit Lord.

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,550
This can only maintain your power for a while.

379
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,080
If you want to recover completely,

380
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,440
you need the real Dongfang Blood

381
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,640
Please guide me.

382
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,890
Go to the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

383
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,740
Spirit-Master Kingdom

384
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,650
is just as its name implies.

385
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,900
The human race living here can control spirits.

They do so with a Mother Talisman.

389
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,170
In order to survive,

390
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,320
the spirits have to obey orders.

391
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,970
I want you to help me

392
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,320
control these resentful spirit slaves

393
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,570
and slaughter the human race

394
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,440
to sow discord between the two races.

395
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,830
By then,

396
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,560
Tushan will definitely make a move.

397
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,980
And you can get your Dongfang Spiritual Blood.

398
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,770

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,120
We must hurry to Tushan.

410
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,350
Yes.

411
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:16,750
Tushan,

412
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,060
I've prepared

413
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,220
a big gift for you.

414
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,350
Who are you?

415
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,840
You invited me here.

416
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,440
Why don't you show yourself?

417
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,070
That's all the power you have?

418
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,190
No wonder you're still a nobody in the spirit clan.

What can I do for you?

425
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm here to help you become famous.

426
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,640
Help me become famous?

427
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,870
That's right.

428
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,780
Your brother is the leader of the Chi Sha Bandits.

429
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,820
You're his only younger brother.

430
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,010
You're not bad either.

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,680
[Leader of the Chi Sha Bandits, Chi Lei]

432
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:19,600
Can you really make me as famous as my brother?

433
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,920
If you want to prove yourself,

434
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,400
go to Tushan to kill the princess of the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

435
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,640
After that,

436
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,980
your reputation

437
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,000
will be higher than the Chi Sha Bandits.

438
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,750
The divine edict.

439
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,260
The second level of Purest Sun Flame!

440
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,300
I did it!

441
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,920
Legend has it that the divine edict holds a

442
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,110
love mission from the Grief Tree for the

443
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,100
chief of Tushan.

444
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,710
But none of the previous chiefs received one.

445
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,480
Why are you receiving one all of a sudden?

446
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
This arrangement

447
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,360
must have its own reason.

448
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,270
It is said that the divine edict's task is closely related to the Grief Tree.

449
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,960
Once the mission is completed,

450
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
the love reaped can nurture the Grief Tree.

451
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,000
If you can't complete it, you will suffer a disaster.

452
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,660
Now that your power is depleted, I'm worried...

453
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,880
Don't worry.

454
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,720
The fox spirits of Tushan

455
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,340
have lived for thousands of years.

456
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,800
No generation had it easy.

457
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,800
Besides, the divine edict is here.

458
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,890
We can only face it.

459
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,860
Maybe this is the Grief Tree's way of saving itself.

460
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,340
Honghong,

461
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,380
I wonder what the divine edict

462
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,440
is about.

463
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,920
It's empty.

464
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,410
The Life Island?

465
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,840
That's right.

466
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,920
If the person behind this really is Shi Ji,

467
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,810
Life Island must have a record of her regathering her soul.

468
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,490
You mean to say...

469
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,060
I want you to go to Life Island

470
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,610
to see if Shi Ji has regathered her soul.

471
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,920
Are you worried that this would be

472
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
a dangerous trip?

473
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,900
No.

474
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,800
You can sacrifice your spirit bone for Tushan.

475
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:30,680
I can't be a coward either.

476
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,240
Don't worry, Chief.

477
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,310
This is related to the survival of Tushan's fox spirits.

478
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,400
If that Demoness

479
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,160
has really returned to stir trouble,

480
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,910
I will protect Tushan even if

481
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,600
I have to sacrifice myself.

482
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,310
Thank you, Elder.

483
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,830
It's a long journey.

484
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,650
Go back and pack up.

485
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,090

Chief.

489
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,490
I'm worried about you.

490
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,400
You asked the princess of Spirit-Master Kingdom

491
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
for a favor to get the six-petaled white epiphyllum.

492
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,640
Over the past few hundred years,

493
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
I watched you visit his grave

494
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,030
on his death anniversary every year.

495
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,590
You search for the flower every hundred years.

496
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,650
Keeping such obsession in your heart

497
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,090
is too painful, too heavy.

498
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,480
I know what to do.

499
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,640

Yes.

We were young when we met.

502
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,850
Even with the white epiphyllum,

503
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,940
your body is slowly growing up.

504
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,750
Time flies.

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,460

509
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,030
As expected, after the Grief Tree recovered,

510
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,090
everyone's business improved a lot.

511

where only spirits live.

515

You're not completely right.

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,380
there are humans here too.

You're a human?

Yes.

You seem new here.

522
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,110
You must be visiting Tushan

for something important.

524
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,720
So you are Yuechu.

525
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Can you tell that I'm human too?

Yes.

527
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,400
I can also tell that you don't know magic.

528
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,530
A human who doesn't know magic took the risk to come here.

529
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,480
You must have something important to ask.

530
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,200
Tell me, what is it?

531
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,620
I...

532
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,300
I want to matchmake with a spirit.

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,680
I mean...

535
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,830
Can humans really fall for spirits?

536
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,360
It's surprising, isn't it?

00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,840
My heart tells me that

I still like him.

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:16,800
It's him.

545
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,190
I know you're from the Spirit-Master Kingdom.

546
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,440
The spirits there

547
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,530
are willing to serve the human race.

Tushan doesn't welcome you.

You're not welcome here. Exactly.

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
His name is Shi Kuan.

He's my personal spirit guard.

Yes, go away! It's embarrassing.

00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,320
You're from the Spirit-Master Kingdom?

not only do you serve and support humans,

562
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,770
you work so hard for them.

563
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,440
You are the disgrace of the spirit clan.

564
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,070
Yes, it's him.

565
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,320
The shame of the spirit clan!

566
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
How can you side with the humans?

567
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,590
Get out. You are not welcome here.

568
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,990
The Deputy Chief is here.

569
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Deputy Chief.

570
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,150
Deputy Chief.

571
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,550
Why are you here

572
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,310
instead of minding your business?

573
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,920
Deputy Chief, you came at the right time.

574
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,020
The demon and master of Spirit-Master Kingdom

575
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,420
have broken into Tushan.

576
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,540
Don't be rude.

577
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,280
They are our guests.

578
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,960
Guests?

579
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,330
No way, Deputy Chief.

580
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,190
Spirit-Master Kingdom seldom comes in contact with the outside world.

581
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,360
Why would Tushan invite them as guests?

582
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,710
That's right.

583
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,570
That makes sense.

584
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,020
What do you plan to do?

585
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,000
We must arrest them

586
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,530
and kick them out of Tushan.

587
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,960
That's right! Kick them out of Tushan!

588
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,590
Okay.

589
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,620
I heard that

590
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,850
this spirit guard is the top warrior of Bei Mountain,

591
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,000
Shi Kuan.

592
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,520
His hands

593
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,170
can dissolve everything.

594
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,270
Why don't you drive him away?

595
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,740
This...

596
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,730
Hurry up. What are you waiting for?

597
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,360
Let's go together.

598
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,760
I just remembered that

599
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,440
no one is tending to my stall.

600
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,480
I'm leaving.

601
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,630
Me too.

602
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,280
Guard Shi, please forgive them.

603
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,080
It's nothing.

604
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,810
Deputy Chief, please come in.

605
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,270
Have you finished collecting the debt?

606
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,480
All you do is eat.

607
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,430
Yaya.

608
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,070
Isn't there something more important than collecting debt right now?

609
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,570
I know we have an important guest in Tushan.

610
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,760
I'm tending to her for you.

611
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,340
Your Highness.

612
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,550
This brat is always so unruly.

613
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,020
Please forgive him.

614
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,920
Rest assured, Deputy Chief.

615
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,280
Yuechu is easygoing and interesting.

616
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,430
We had a great conversation.

617
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,030
That's good.

618
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,310
By the way,

619
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,630
Honghong has invited you to the Huguang Pavilion.

620
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,760
Please come with me.

621
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,740
It's none of your business.

622
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,570
Stay out of it.

623
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,030
Honghong asked me to do this.

624
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,680
It’s very important.

625
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,260
I’ve brought what the Chief requested.

626
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,220
Something Lady Fairy requested?

627
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,230
What is it?

628
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,300
This is what you requested.

629
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,930
I traveled night and day

630
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,350
to deliver it before the specified day.

631
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,960
Thank you.

632
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,440
You don’t look well.

633
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,800
I’m fine.

634
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,280
I have completed

635
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,710
your request.

636
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,570
About my request...

637
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,950
what do you think?

638
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,820
Your Highness, do you really want to matchmake with a spirit?
