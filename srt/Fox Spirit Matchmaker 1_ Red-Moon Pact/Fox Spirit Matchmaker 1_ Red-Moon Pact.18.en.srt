[Episode 18]

4
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,750
How dare that brat covet Honghong?

5
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,110
Honghong.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,120
You must not be fooled

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,180
by his sweet words.

8
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,510
I actually quite like him.

9
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,710
Since he came to Tushan,

10
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,170
Honghong has smiled more often than before.

11
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,430
Have I?

12
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,009
Yes.

13
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,090
I agree with Rongrong on this.

14
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,080
In the past,

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,590
you kept a straight face

16
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,330
most of the time.

17
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,910
But now, you often

18
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,030
wear a smile.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,810
That's because you two have finally grown up.

20
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,079
Especially you.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Not a troublemaker anymore.

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,280
Look.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,430
Honghong has even learned

24
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,090
to tease people from that boy.

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,630
Li, Feng.

26
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,360
Come out.

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,250
Why were you two hiding there?

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
We…

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,180
You can't tell her!

30
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,520
Why not?

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,320
You two are sneaky.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,590
You're definitely up to no good.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,730
No, absolutely not.

34
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,140
Then why were you hiding there?

35
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,310
Tell us, or your allowances this month

36
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,590
will be…

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
I'll tell you.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,060
You can't tell her!

39
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,400
It's okay.

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,840
Anyway, Yuechu just said

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,430
we should keep it from Chief.

42
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,150
He didn't say

43
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,280
we can't tell Yaya and Rongrong either.

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,410
Just keep it from me?

45
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,829
A surprise?

46
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,690
We didn't tell Chief anything.

47
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,290
Yeah. We've kept the secret.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,150
A rain of petals?

49
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,360
I didn't expect

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,200
Honghong to fall in love with a human.

51
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,960
Even more surprising, that guy is really Yuechu.

52
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,190
Yeah.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,450
Back then,

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,870
I thought because of Dongfang Luo,

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,829
she'd die alone.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,070
Are you dumb?

57
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,710
I told you

58
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,140
Dongfang Luo saved Honghong and me,

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,890
and she just felt guilty about him.

60
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,200
If I had gone to the human world with you back then,

61
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,200
maybe those tragedies wouldn't have happened.

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,560
But anyway,

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,810
it's great that Honghong has moved on.

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,800
Yes.

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,720
Now that she's in love,

66
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,890
the Love Seed in her body will become stronger.

67
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,019
This is a good thing for Tushan too.

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,190
If that brat weren't a human,

69
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,270
I'd definitely

70
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,130
prepare a generous gift for them.

71
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,390
Yuechu is a human.

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,810
What about your Lai?

73
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,120
Are you kidding?

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,340
How can you compare that human boy to Lai?

75
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,670
Lai is an authentic spirit.

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,840
Fine, fine.

77
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
I forgot.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Your Lai is the Poison Boy from the Nan Kingdom,

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,680
an intimidating evil spirit that every spirit scares.

80
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,940
You bad girl, what's wrong with you tonight?

81
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,470
You keep contradicting me.

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
I see.

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,750
Now that both Honghong and I

84
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,140
have found love,

85
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,720
you feel lonely, right?

86
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,810
Not even close.

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,430
To me, in this world,

88
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,490
there are things more important than love.

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,630
In my eyes, certain things

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,060
are much more interesting than love.

91
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,780
I'll get going,

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,620
leaving you to enjoy the night with my future brother-in-law.

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,480
You're so bad!

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,160
How dare you make fun of your elder sister?

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,970
I won't let you get away with it!

96
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,800
Give it to me.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,850
What do you mean?

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,220
Your gift.

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,210
The Qixi Festival is coming.

100
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,140
You must've prepared a gift for me.

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,200
Give it to me now.

102
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,170
You already know.

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I planned to give it to you

104
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,380
at the festival tomorrow,

105
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,020
but you're so impatient.

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
What's this?

107
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,650
How do you like it?

108
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,310
It's hideous.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,270
Hideous?

110
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,970
Well, it's the first time I've made something like this.

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,700
I admit I'm not skilled enough.

112
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,200
Could you just make do with it?

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,090
What else?

114
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,160
What else?

115
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,070
Stop dawdling.

116
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,470
Take all of them out.

117
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,360
It's impossible that you've

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,290
only prepared this hideous thing.

119
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,720
Seriously?

120
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,870
Even that brat, Yuechu, knows to

121
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,480
prepare lanterns and a rain of petals for Honghong.

122
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
You're a spirit.

123
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,430
This ugly thing is all you got for me?

124
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,000
Well…

125
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,560
I know.

126
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,460
There's a button

127
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,510
on this thing that can make

128
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,010
fine wine flow out, right?

129
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,500
Well…

130
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,030
Is it here?

131
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,360
Yaya.

132
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,720
It's…

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,110
Yaya.

134
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,740
So,

135
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,310
it's just an ordinary ugly thing.

136
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,830
It has no magic.

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,330
To think I told Rongrong

138
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,120
you were much smarter than Yuechu.

139
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,380
In the end, this is what you've prepared.

140
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,340
Yaya.

141
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,970
Sorry. Don't be angry.

142
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,480
Next time, I'll definitely…

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,630
Forget next time.

144
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,560
I want it now.

145
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,460
Remake it before dawn,

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,060
or you don't need to come back!

147
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,690
Sure.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,659
No problem.

149
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,040
Be back soon.

150
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,950
You can't even prepare a proper gift.

151
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,270
I'm so mad!

152
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,160
Why don't you hang it by the window?

153
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,610
Lady Fairy.

154
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
By the way,

155
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,070
what's that in your hand?

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,200
After thinking about it,

157
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,280
I think Lai has a point.

158
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,010
Maybe you'd like some handmade stuff.

159
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,480
So I made this myself.

160
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,770
Well, it looks a bit…

161
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,780
I wonder if you like it.

162
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,860
Let me see.

163
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,669
Indeed, it's not pretty,

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,120
but I like it.

165
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,170
It's late. Go get some rest.

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,440
Okay.

167
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,430
Lady Fairy, you should get some rest too.

168
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll leave after hanging it up.

169
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,780
Lady Fairy.

170
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,460
Are you going to sleep?

171
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,710
What if I am?

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,050
What if I'm not?

173
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
If not,

174
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,480
let me tell you a story.

175
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,050
Once upon a time,

176
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,120
there was a human boy

177
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,630
whose parents loved him very much.

178
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,680
The best in the world.

179
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,600
You brat.

180
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,440
On his 8th birthday,

181
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,890
his parents

182
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,330
were killed by their enemies,

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,440
who then came after the boy.

184
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,630
He thought he was doomed,

185
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,500
but unexpectedly,

186
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
he met a gorgeous spirit.

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,520
From the moment he fell in love with her,

188
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,030
he was not lonely anymore,

189
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,420
nor was he afraid.

190
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,550
He'd always protect that spirit

191
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,250
throughout his life.

192
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,710
I, Dongfang Yuechu,

193
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,790
will protect Lady Fairy,

194
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,390
forever and ever.

195
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,030
It's you.

196
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,260
Where is Spirit Lord?

197
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Where is Spirit Lord?

198
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,890
Spirit Lord.

199
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,200
Spirit Lord.

200
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,510
Spirit Lord, avenge me.

201
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,430
Spirit Lord.

202
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Spirit Lord.

203
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,120
What do you want?

204
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,930
I want Tushan Honghong

205
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,430
and Dongfang Yuechu to live in hell forever.

206
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,240
No problem.

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,280
The cost is your life.

208
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,930
What's the matter?

209
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,200
At this time,

210
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,460
you still want to live?

211
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,560
It seems that you're quite satisfied

212
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
with your current state.

213
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,280
You're right.

214
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
At this point,

215
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,350
what's the point of me clinging to life?

216
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,880
Spirit Lord,

217
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,790
what more can I do for you?

218
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,670
Your primordial core.

219
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
I gave you the Refined Spirit Core back then

220
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,480
to make you take the brunt when it backfired.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
This primordial core

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
is a top-quality one.

223
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,350
Don't forget to kill Dongfang Yuechu

224
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,320
and destroy Tushan!

225
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,090
Congratulations, Spirit Lord,

226
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,750
on getting

227
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,410
the primordial core enhanced by the Refined Spirit Core.

228
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,140
You're even more powerful now.

229
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,920
Tushan Honghong could never imagine that

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,920
not only did we escape last time,

231
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,870
but we also repaired my spirit core.

232
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,620
Chief.

233
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,040
Jin Renfeng is dead.

234
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,080
A passing-by spirit sensed a strange aura

235
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,280
and found his body in the bamboo forest.

236
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:23,920
Besides,

237
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,350
his primordial core is gone.

238
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,500
It's the teleportation spell.

239
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Sure enough, Shi Ji is still alive.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,200
This powerful spell is from outside the circle.

241
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,760
It uses objects to transport people

242
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
to another place in an instant.

243
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,890
That day, we thought

244
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,550
the souls of Shi Ji and Guoguo had vanished.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,620
But it turns out that they were prepared

246
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,480
and made their escape in this way.

247
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,310
Outside the circle?

248
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,290
Shi Ji knows spells from outside the circle?

249
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,660
The force outside is mysterious and powerful.

250
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,320
If Shi Ji is colluding with it,

251
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,970
their target won't just be Tushan,

252
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,290
but all six realms.

253
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,490
That day, the Hidden Nail damaged her spirit core.

254
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,260
Has she repaired it too?

255
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,890
It seems so.

256
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,170
She's repaired her spirit core

257
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,550
and gotten Jin Renfeng's primordial core which had been enhanced

258
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,080
by the Refined Spirit Core.

259
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,030
Now,

260
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,370
I'm afraid Shi Ji has become even more powerful.

261
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
This time,

262
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,540
I don't think you can stop me again, Tushan Honghong.

263
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,670
The force outside the circle

264
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,120
will take over the inside sooner or later.

265
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,570
Shi Ji is absorbing power again.

266
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,760
As we expected,

267
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,090
she's much stronger this time.

268
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,000
So the force that's colluding with her

269
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,460
can't be underestimated.

270
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,620
Lai.

271
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,300
Do you remember what happened back then?

272
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,800
Back then, Aolai Sanshao found that force

273
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
and used half of his spirit power

274
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,940
to draw a circle to keep it out.

275
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,210
From then on,

276
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,710
any creatures outside will vanish into thin air

277
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,440
once they step into the circle.

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,000
I wonder how Shi Ji

279
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,510
got in contact with them.

280
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,380
Have they already broken into the circle?

281
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,870
Most likely.

282
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,840
But the fact that they're using Shi Ji as a feeler

283
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,910
means they can't fully infiltrate the circle yet.

284
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,540
You have a point.

285
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,000
Our priority now

286
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,500
is to stop Shi Ji.

287
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,050
Once we stop her,

288
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,400
the outside force behind her can't take further action.

289
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,310
At the moment,

290
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,240
neither of us

291
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,119
are strong enough to stop Shi Ji

292
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,520
and the force behind her.

293
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,240
To solve this once and for all,

294
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm afraid there's only one way:

295
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,930
sacrifice the Love Seed

296
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,810
to track down Shi Ji with the Grief Tree

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,260
and seal her inside it.

298
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Only by doing that

299
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,200
can we keep the Grief Tree's power

300
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,400
of protecting lovers

301
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,440
and stop Shi Ji from doing evil.

302
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,470
Chief.

303
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,710
I know you're worried that the force outside

304
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,030
may attack the six realms.

305
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,190
But giving up on love

306
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,790
and sacrificing the Love Seed

307
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,570
is unfair to both you

308
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,930
and Yuechu.

309
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,140
Please think twice.

310
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,510
This place is great.

311
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,510
Lady Fairy will like it.

312
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,070
The spiritual butterfly has sent her the message.

313
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,470
She'll definitely show up tonight, right?

314
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,680
Why hasn't Chief come?

315
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,000
We've been waiting for so long.

316
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,410
Yeah.

317
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,210
Be patient.

318
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,840
She will come.

319
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
You're sure of it?

320
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,710
Of course.

321
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,140
After she comes,

322
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,760
you two must do your best

323
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,440
to give her a big surprise.

324
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,800
Got it.

325
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,980
We're already prepared.

326
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,750
We'll make tonight so romantic

327
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,090
that you can never forget it.

328
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,650
No wonder you're raised on nectar.

329
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,080
I know I can count on you.

330
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,440
Chief.

331
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,760
Once you sacrifice the Love Seed,

332
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,960
there will be no love left in your heart.

333
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,660
The person you love deeply now

334
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,510
will be completely forgotten.

335
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,110
Every little thing about him

336
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,950
will be wiped from your memory.

337
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Every moment you two spent together

338
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,530
will also be erased.

339
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,910
Is that really what you want?

340
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,000
It's so late now.

341
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,830
Chief is not coming.

342
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,750
She'll come.

343
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,620
You're so stubborn.

344
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,110
Lady Fairy.

345
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,610
Lady Fairy is here.

346
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,370
Wake up.

347
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,160
She's here. Wake up.

348
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,400
Go get ready.

349
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,830
Wait for me.

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,030
Lady Fairy.

351
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,710
Lady Fairy.

352
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,050
Although you already know

353
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,680
how I feel about you,

354
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,630
I still want to tell you formally

355
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
that I, Dongfang Yuechu,

356
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,600
love you, Tushan Honghong.

357
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,220
For the rest of my life

358
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,160
and in my next life,

359
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,770
I'll always stay with you

360
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,130
and protect you.

361
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,530
I don't need your protection.

362
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,720
Why?

363
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,030
Last night, you said…

364
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,430
Spirits have long lives.

365
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,640
To me,

366
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,970
you're merely a passer-by.

367
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,800
Lady Fairy,

368
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,650
you're lying.

369
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,640
I know

370
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,040
you must've said that for a reason.

371
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,340
You love me.

372
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,560
I can see it in your eyes.

373
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Lying to yourself

374
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,790
can only make you suffer more.

375
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,830
I know

376
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,650
humans and spirits are different.

377
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,480
What if…

378
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,750
What if I'm willing to be just a passer-by in your life?

379
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,530
As just a passer-by,

380
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
you don't need to stop for me.

381
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,430
Is Dongfang Luo the only man

382
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,910
in your heart?

383
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,680
It turns out

384
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,880
it's all just my wishful thinking.

385
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,520
But don't forget

386
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,400
you still owe me one.

387
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,080
♫Staring into the moonlit sky♫

388
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:59,090
♫Memories whisper softly in my ears♫

389
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,690
♫Borrowing a shimmer of light♫

390
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,070
♫To illuminate you♫

391
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,540
♫A thousand years feel like a fleeting moment♫

392
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,380
♫This isn't our first time around♫

393
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,020
♫Despite all the hardships♫

394
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,260
♫The warmth of love still remains♫

395
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,400
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

396
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,500
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

397
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,540
♫If you look back♫

398
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,900
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

399
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,820
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

400
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,790
Spirits have long lives.

401
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,250
♫To bury my entire life♫

402
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,720
To me,

403
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,780
you're merely a passer-by.

404
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:53,510
♫Looking back, how can I make it worth it?♫

405
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,310
Lady Fairy,

406
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,620
my heart is very small.

407
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,830
It only has space for one person.

408
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,650
♫If you forget everything in your next life♫

409
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,650
♫Miss someone but no one is coming♫

410
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,450
♫If you look back♫

411
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:22,170
♫I'm afraid I have to see you leave once more♫

412
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,370
I, Dongfang Yuechu,

413
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,120
love you, Tushan Honghong.

414
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,500
For the rest of my life

415
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,720
♫If I make a vow in the swirling snow♫

416
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,350
and in my next life,

417
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,020
♫To bury my entire life♫

418
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,550
I'll stay with you

419
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,280
and protect you.

420
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,540
♫When I look back, you're under the tree of longing♫

421
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,600
Yuechu.

422
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,240
Yuechu?

423
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,940
You can talk to me about anything, you know.

424
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,200
Yuechu.

425
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,240
Yaya.

426
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,190
What brought you here?

427
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,720
Have you heard about it too?

428
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,610
You need to ask?

429
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,460
All the flower spirits at Tushan are talking about it.

430
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
How can I not know?

431
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,390
Why is it so cold here?

432
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,160
Is he practicing some black magic

433
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,360
to freeze himself to death?

434
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,620
Although Honghong has suddenly become cold to him,

435
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,650
trying to kill himself is too much.

436
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,060
That's not black magic.

437
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,800
He's just heartbroken.

438
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,810
People say tough guys don't cry.

439
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,640
But I don't think a female spirit like you

440
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,740
can understand male spirits like us

441
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,200
and how deep our love runs.

442
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,730
Why do you sound

443
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,980
so resentful?

444
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,970
I wouldn't dare.

445
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,190
Yuechu.

446
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,110
Do you guys have to make it harder for me?

447
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,930
Go flirt somewhere else.

448
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,610
You brat!

449
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,090
I personally came here to console you.

450
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,420
You should be grateful.

451
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,720
Do you want me to knock some sense into you?

452
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,320
Calm down.

453
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,640
He's very sad now.

454
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,180
Let's leave him alone.

455
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,200
Let's go. Let's go.

456
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,070
Go easy on him.

457
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,510
Fine. I'll go easy on him,

458
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,530
but not on you.

459
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,070
You said you'd make that bottle into a hidden weapon.

460
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,870
Where is it?

461
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,180
You've tried so many times

462
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,590
but still haven't made it.

463
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm the Poison Boy.

464
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
I'm used to using poison.

465
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
Suddenly, you want me to make a hidden weapon.

466
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,960
Of course it'll take time.

467
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,600
That's just an excuse.

468
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,730
How…

469
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,980
How is he?

470
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
He's not eating or drinking and won't leave the house.

471
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,150
You forbid us to persuade you,

472
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,070
but I have to say it.

473
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,400
Although you're connected with the Grief Tree,

474
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,640
taking the Love Seed out

475
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,640
won't affect the love in your heart.

476
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,950
But after losing it,

477
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,650
you can't feel love again.

478
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,340
How are you going to live like that for the rest of your long life?

479
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,700
Before I met him,

480
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,220
I had lived just fine for so long.

481
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,400
But what were you like

482
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,750
in those years?

483
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,170
Ever since that incident,

484
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,010
you'd been mired in guilt and pain

485
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,660
and never smiled again.

486
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,570
It was after that boy came to Tushan

487
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,580
that you started smiling again

488
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,120
and came back to life.

489
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,340
So what?

490
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
Both to love and to be loved

491
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,040
can help people through their darkest times.

492
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,370
If you give up on love,

493
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,440
what if…

494
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,590
Stop persuading me.

495
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,160
If I don't seal Shi Ji,

496
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,790
the six realms will face a catastrophe.

497
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,920
Compared to the safety of countless humans and spirits,

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,180
my love affair is nothing.

499
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,950
You insist on doing that,

500
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,500
but have you considered Yuechu's feelings?

501
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
He's young.

502
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,000
Soon,

503
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,430
he'll forget me

504
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,510
and start over.

505
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,070
Yuechu.

506
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,860
Come out.

507
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,490
I have a secret to tell you.

508
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,640
Don't you want to hear a secret?

509
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,590
It's about Honghong.

510
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,240
What secret?

511
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,880
Come with me.

512
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,720
Why have you brought me here?

513
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,450
You'll know after going in.

514
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,420
You're so reluctant to see him?

515
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,400
He hasn't washed his face for centuries.

516
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,530
What's there to see?

517
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,270
Don't you want to know

518
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,750
why Honghong can't get over this guy

519
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,570
who hasn't washed his face for centuries?

520
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,580
Dongfang Luo

521
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,430
is lying here because of Honghong.

522
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,270
Why?

523
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,920
What happened back then was too complicated.

524
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
And it's not my story to tell.

525
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,820
Anyway, after what happened to Dongfang Luo,

526
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,640
Honghong has been racked

527
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,970
with guilt.

528
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,240
Over the past hundreds of years,

529
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,260
Lady Fairy has always felt indebted to him.

530
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,140
Dongfang Luo once told Honghong that

531
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,940
there will come a day when humans and spirits live in peace.

532
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,270
So,

533
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,840
Lady Fairy has turned Dongfang Luo's wish

534
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,860
into her own wish.

535
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,110
At least, in the first place,

536
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,680
it was Dongfang Luo who made her realize that

537
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,510
there was kindness and wickedness in every clan,

538
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,550
and humans could be very kind too.

539
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,590
Why are you telling me this?

540
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,880
Because I hope you can understand

541
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,210
no matter what Honghong has decided to do,

542
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,510
it's because she has duties to fulfill

543
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,780
and has no choice.

544
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,510
Who is he?

545
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,330
Just an old friend.

546
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,380
You should know

547
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,240
Honghong's been protecting his soul for hundreds of years.

548
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,320
For her,

549
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,530
besides Tushan,

550
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,310
nothing is more important

551
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,770
than Dongfang Luo's soul.

552
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,750
Because of guilt,

553
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,980
Lady Fairy can't let go of Dongfang Luo.

554
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,090
I can't let go of Lady Fairy either.

555
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,850
Since that's the case,

556
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,410
what can I do now?

557
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,940
Dongfang Luo once told Honghong that

558
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,820
there will come a day when humans and spirits live in peace.

559
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,640
I hope for a world

560
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,930
where humans and spirits no longer hate each other.

561
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,260
All children

562
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,040
can live happily and freely

563
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
with their parents,

564
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,330
not separated from them because of the turmoil

565
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,790
caused by a few ambitious humans or spirits.

566
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Yuechu.

567
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,170
[Mini Pavilion]

568
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,440
Rongrong.

569
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,460
What's up?

570
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,710
Just checking on you.

571
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,090
You swung the door open.

572
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,760
Looks like you're much better now.

573
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,310
Of course.

574
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,710
You know me.

575
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm Dongfang Yuechu.

576
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,370
I always bounce back quickly.

577
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,920
And I can tell you for sure

578
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,040
that one day

579
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,080
I'll definitely hold a place

580
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,710
in Lady Fairy's heart.

581
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,610
What are you going to do?

582
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,020
I can't tell you my plan.

583
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,840
But I'm going to

584
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,570
free Lady Fairy from her guilt.

585
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,620
By that time,

586
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,960
she can choose

587
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,520
whom she wants to give her heart to.

588
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,490
Dad.

589
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,410
Mom.

590
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,560
I'm great at roasting sweet potatoes now.

591
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,070
If you two were still alive,

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,120
the three of us

593
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,410
could run a stall

594
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,850
selling roasted sweet potatoes in some village.

595
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,580
Business would surely be good.

596
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,670
Dad.

597
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,710
Mom.

598
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,980
I expelled

599
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,610
Jin Renfeng from Divine Flame Villa last time.

600
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,230
You must have known about it.

601
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,760
Now,

602
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,890
I have something more important to do.

603
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,590
You two

604
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,770
will support me again, right?

605
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,420
Silly boy.

606
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
You already know the answer.

607
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,670
Peace

608
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,160
is good for both humans and spirits.

609
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,650
Moreover,

610
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,410
it concerns my son's happiness.

611
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,320
You already know?

612
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,710
Of course.

613
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,260
Since you were little,

614
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,710
I've always known

615
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,060
what's on your mind.

616
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,770
If you've made up your mind, just go for it.

617
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,150
As your parents,

618
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,710
we'll always support you.

619
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,110
But I'm all by myself.

620
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,800
How can I achieve my goal?

621
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,710
Silly boy,

622
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,550
can't you use your brain?

623
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
Although you can't expose

624
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,840
your identity as the descendant of the Dongfang family,

625
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,500
you can join the Yiqi Alliance

626
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,500
and try to become its director.

627
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,490
By then, how humans should treat spirits

628
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,760
will be up to you.

629
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,130
But if I join the Yiqi Alliance,

630
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,130
Tushan will see me as an enemy.

631
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,110
What does it matter?

632
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,530
Even if they'll see me as an enemy,

633
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,960
I still have to do it.
