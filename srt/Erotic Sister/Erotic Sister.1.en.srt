00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,813
(4 pretty girls in Hanguk University
Women of Virtue)

2
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,063
Goodness!

3
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:30,146
(Oh Ji-young, 27 years old
Flight attendant)

4
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,188
Goodness.

5
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:35,479
This is a restroom.

6
00:00:39,313 --> 00:00:40,521
You hung up on me?

7
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:42,021
(Jung Soo-min, 27
Japanese teacher)

8
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,354
Is this the animal kingdom?

9
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:47,521
Hey.

10
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,771
Are you feeling any better?

11
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:57,938
It's fish cake.

12
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,063
(Lee So-Ra, 27
Show host)

13
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,229
(Yoo Eun-sook, 27)

14
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,646
(And a senior from college?)

15
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:10,896
You're nothing like how we used
to be after we graduated.

16
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:06,896
Hello?

17
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:08,813
What?

18
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:14,813
Gosh, is she trying to
get us to kill her?

19
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:16,563
What did I tell you?

20
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:20,104
That bitch is just trying
to get us jealous.

21
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:21,854
Yoo Eun-sook?

22
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,813
What nonsense is this?

23
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,271
Where?

24
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:30,271
Solo Bar?

25
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:37,271
(Sadly Sisters)

26
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:49,813
Gosh, no one is on time.

27
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:51,021
Come in.

28
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,729
Goodness.

29
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,271
You must not be open yet.

30
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,479
We'll start now since a
beautiful customer is here.

31
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:00,354
Please have a seat.

32
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,396
Okay.

33
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,271
Goodness!

34
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,979
Please be careful.

35
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:30,188
So this is "Single Bar?"

36
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,688
Goodness!

37
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:49,479
I'm so sorry. I got water on you.

38
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:35,479
What is it?

39
00:05:39,313 --> 00:05:40,354
Yes.

40
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:43,313
Bye.

41
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,646
Why speak Japanese and not Korean?

42
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:49,396
I work at a Japanese school.

43
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:51,438
By the way, Ji-young,

44
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:53,521
it's been so long.

45
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,313
Yes.

46
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,104
How many years has it been?

47
00:05:57,854 --> 00:06:01,771
Your skin looks so good now.

48
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:04,854
Soo-min.

49
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,813
I could say the same to you.

50
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:12,604
Are you ready to order?

51
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:15,813
We'll have whatever you recommend.

52
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:18,104
My recommendation? Okay.

53
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,396
What is that?

54
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,604
Is that a man or a Greek god?

55
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,521
Guys!

56
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,104
You're early.

57
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,938
Right.

58
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:45,521
She's always late.

59
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:48,729
Have a seat.

60
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:03,438
Goodness, Soo-min.
What are you looking at?

61
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:07,521
You don't even look at your friend
who you haven't seen for years.

62
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,188
Hey!

63
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:30,063
You're nothing like how we used to be...

64
00:07:30,938 --> 00:07:33,771
after we graduated.

65
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:35,938
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,313
You're not the one to talk.

67
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:40,438
You two,

68
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:42,813
listen carefully.

69
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,438
Who are we?

70
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:50,729
Did you forget already?

71
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:56,188
We are the 4 pretty girls
in Hanguk University, WOV.

72
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,354
This is on the house.

73
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:14,104
Goodness! That's very unsanitary!

74
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,354
It'll sanitize the food.

75
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:32,188
Hey, you get excited over
nothing like you always do.

76
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:36,271
How could you say that...

77
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:41,729
like you don't care?

78
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:48,896
Gosh.

79
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:51,729
Here you go again.

80
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:55,771
Is this the animal kingdom?

81
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:58,521
You're always growling at each other.

82
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,563
Don't you remember, Soo-min?

83
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:09,771
Our crush, Sunwoo Wan.

84
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:27,521
Goodness, what do I do?

85
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:30,896
It's the guy I'm seeing.

86
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,313
Lucky bitch.

87
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:43,188
She's seeing someone.

88
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:48,854
She always gets help when needed.

89
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:56,438
Goodness.

90
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,021
Sir.

91
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,313
That's not it.

92
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,729
I'm not in the bathroom.

93
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,813
I was just cooking.

94
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:16,688
I'm sorry?

95
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:19,396
The sink?

96
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:29,771
I'm washing some vegetables.

97
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:34,188
I'm going to cook some big eggplants.

98
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:42,396
Sir.

99
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,646
What nonsense is that?

100
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:54,021
I sold mackerel, shell fish,
abalone all week.

101
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:59,271
Do you think I'm a cart bar owner
who sells seafood?

102
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,938
Hello?

103
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,438
Hello?

104
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:12,479
What? You hung up on me?

105
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,354
He looks like a carp penis.

106
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,521
The waiter at the bar looks
so much better than him.

107
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:05,229
Ever since I first saw you,

108
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,521
I couldn't get you out of my head.

109
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:13,229
But...

110
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,104
this is a restroom.

111
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:13,438
Gosh, I must have gone crazy.

112
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,354
The first vow we made as
women of virtue was...

113
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:21,521
giving your virginity to someone you love.

114
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,479
Right.

115
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:27,896
Why do you talk like that?

116
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:33,771
Were you into someone else other than Wan?

117
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,438
What are you talking about?

118
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:42,354
What was our second vow?
Did you forget?

119
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:47,396
"If you lose your virginity,
you are not a women of virtue."

120
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:51,188
"You'll be kicked out forever."

121
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,396
And you say that?

122
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,271
You bitch.

123
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,896
I'm sorry.

124
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,646
Take a shot, Ji-young.

125
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:11,563
Gosh, you were so excited when you left.

126
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:14,188
You don't look so happy.

127
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:15,813
Why?

128
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,313
Is your guy not into you anymore?

129
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:25,688
He told me to go find someone else.

130
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,938
What is this?

131
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,729
It's fish cake.

132
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,604
What?

133
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:45,146
Stop with your Japanese.

134
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:48,188
It's getting ridiculous.

135
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:56,563
It's much better than clam soup.

136
00:15:58,688 --> 00:16:00,104
Of course.

137
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:05,521
Fish cakes are long and thick.

138
00:16:06,604 --> 00:16:09,479
It's very tasty.

139
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:16,604
Guys.

140
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,521
Is this the place?

141
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,646
What do you mean?

142
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:28,104
Is this where Eun-sook
asked us to meet her?

143
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:41,396
Are you drunk already, Ji-young?

144
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:49,521
Te quiero todos.

145
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:55,688
I love you all.

146
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,479
Gosh, is that what you were saying?

147
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:17,438
Get yourself together.

148
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,563
What did I do?

149
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,938
When we were in college,

150
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,188
did you ever have a boyfriend?

151
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:38,021
When you go to the bathroom,

152
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,563
can you even pee?

153
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:48,104
I've never been in a relationship.

154
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:52,563
I can't even pee anymore.

155
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:58,563
Because of the tradition
that seniors had made,

156
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:04,729
trying to follow the rule
of the women of virtue,

157
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,396
we never had a proper boyfriend, have we?

158
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,563
No.

159
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:15,354
I chose one person,

160
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:19,396
I gave my virginity to him.

161
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,396
That was nothing after I graduated.

162
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,646
Then...

163
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:29,604
were you ever in a relationship?

164
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,479
After we graduated, I mean.

165
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,729
What kind of a question is that?

166
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:47,146
I swear.

167
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:54,688
So-Ra, this bitch, had sex that night...

168
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,313
with Wan.

169
00:18:57,438 --> 00:18:58,688
What?

170
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,604
That night.

171
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,313
After sports day.

172
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,021
We've all been drinking at a cart bar.

173
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:11,979
What did you...

174
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:16,063
whisper to Wan when you
were sitting next to him?

175
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,021
Girl,

176
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:20,771
when did I whisper?

177
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:30,104
No one is around, is there?

178
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:03,938
Wan, what are you doing there?
Come on.

179
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,729
Okay, coming.

180
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,479
Goodness, Wan is here?

181
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:22,354
Are you happy now?

182
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:25,354
You bitches.

183
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:32,438
I only asked because you
came back with Wan.

184
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:34,146
I'm sorry.

185
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,104
You're sorry?

186
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:42,396
Honestly, I wasn't going to say this.

187
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:44,146
You...

188
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:51,313
I'm sorry. I need to take this.

189
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,729
Goodness, hello.

190
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,354
Yes, of course I remember.

191
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:05,813
Soo-min, what was that?

192
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:12,271
- What do you mean?
- You were saying something earlier.

193
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,938
Right.

194
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,188
That's...

195
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:23,271
It's fine, it's just the two of us now.

196
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:25,604
Tell me. What is it?

197
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:30,896
On the sports day...

198
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:32,938
You remember too, don't you?

199
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:37,479
I don't remember everything.

200
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:38,896
And?

201
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:41,979
You really don't remember?

202
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:46,438
That night, the bathroom was locked.

203
00:21:47,188 --> 00:21:50,729
Girls were standing in line.
It was a mess.

204
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,521
- Don't you remember?
- Right.

205
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:59,188
I really had to go that night.
I went to an alley behind the bar.

206
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:00,688
What?

207
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,188
Then...

208
00:22:04,063 --> 00:22:06,146
Was that you in the alley?

209
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,854
Gosh, I feel so sick.

210
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,688
Goodness, Wan.

211
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:43,896
Here. Drink some water.

212
00:22:53,354 --> 00:22:56,646
Gosh, are you okay?

213
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,729
You shouldn't have drunk this much.

214
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,854
Wan.

215
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:16,771
You know our club's motto, don't you?

216
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,229
I do.

217
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:25,104
So I was going to tell
you how I feel tonight.

218
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,021
So do you get what I mean?

219
00:23:35,604 --> 00:23:36,771
What?

220
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:53,979
What are you doing?

221
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:55,479
Come on.

222
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:10,729
- Is that all?
- Hey.

223
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:15,479
Would you want to make out with
someone who just threw up?

224
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:21,021
Well, some try to get some
when a girl is on her period.

225
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:25,563
I see your lack of romance is
making you say weird stuff.

226
00:24:25,938 --> 00:24:29,104
This is a Single Bar.

227
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:31,938
Why don't you find someone here?

228
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,313
You crazy bitch.

229
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:44,188
I don't see anyone but us. Do you?

230
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:15,729
Who is it?

231
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,188
Hello?

232
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:26,604
Yes, sir.

233
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:31,021
Yes.

234
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:36,063
No, I'm at the gym right now.

235
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:45,021
No, I can't fly that day.

236
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,104
Pardon?

237
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:52,521
Sir!

238
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,354
Gosh.

239
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:19,271
That relieved my constipation.

240
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:29,813
But I was going to see a movie
with that guy on Sunday.

241
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:01,563
Their food is really good.

242
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:06,229
Why, are you hungry after
you went to take a dump?

243
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:13,104
Ji-young was always using the bathroom.

244
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:15,646
How could you say that?

245
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:19,479
Don't you remember?

246
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:26,938
Did something happen between you
two while I went to the bathroom?

247
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:34,979
When we went out to drink
after sports day...

248
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:39,938
what did you do with Wan in the bathroom?

249
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:50,188
(Occupied)

250
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,396
Damn it.

251
00:28:16,271 --> 00:28:18,438
No toilet paper?

252
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:23,313
No.

253
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,479
I had it in here.

254
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,604
I have to have it.

255
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:35,688
Damn it.

256
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:43,604
Where are my socks?

257
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,021
Gosh, I left them at the field.

258
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,104
Where's my underwear?

259
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:17,146
Damn it.

260
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,104
Those bitches.

261
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,604
Why did they have to
have a no underwear day?

262
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:25,521
Damn it.

263
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,688
Hey, what are you doing here?

264
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:59,396
Gosh.

265
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,854
Wan.

266
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:21,146
You always remember what I want to forget.

267
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,271
You're such a bitch.

268
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:28,938
I only asked because...

269
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:32,771
you came out of the bathroom with Wan.

270
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:37,104
So who gave you that toilet paper?

271
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,938
Was it...

272
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,938
No way.

273
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:48,729
Didn't you say Wan was the
only one in the bathroom?

274
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:01,063
I need to use the bathroom.

275
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:09,438
No. Wan was in the alley at the time.

276
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:14,438
Goodness.

277
00:34:16,063 --> 00:34:17,396
What do I do?

278
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:20,479
It looks like I peed my pants.

279
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,229
Who is that?

280
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:51,563
Meow.

281
00:34:52,188 --> 00:34:53,646
Meow.

282
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:55,979
Who are you?

283
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,188
It's you, So-Ra.

284
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:01,438
What are you doing here?

285
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:03,646
I see.

286
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,604
You're looking for a cat, aren't you?

287
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:10,813
I'm a pro.

288
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:15,188
Meow.

289
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,063
Meow.

290
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:19,979
Meow...

291
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:23,479
Why aren't you calling the cat?

292
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:26,563
Meow.

293
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:29,354
Meow.

294
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,438
Meow.

295
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:34,604
Meow.

296
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,729
Are you okay?

297
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:41,646
Let's see.

298
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:43,729
Goodness.

299
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:46,479
Gosh.

300
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,646
So-Ra.

301
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:52,229
It'll get infected if
you leave it like this.

302
00:35:53,438 --> 00:35:54,604
Gosh.

303
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:42,104
What was that?

304
00:37:43,896 --> 00:37:45,271
I heard something.

305
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:03,646
Goodness.

306
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:05,354
It's a cat.

307
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:08,896
Here, kitty.

308
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,146
Here, Kitty.

309
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,646
Here, kitty kitty.

310
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:14,521
Here, kitty.

311
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:17,313
Here, kitty.

312
00:39:05,938 --> 00:39:08,146
You said you were in the bathroom.

313
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:10,521
Yes.

314
00:39:10,563 --> 00:39:12,229
I was.

315
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,604
Because of that stupid toilet paper.

316
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:19,563
What happened in the alley?

317
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:20,896
What?

318
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:22,646
Nothing.

319
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,729
You're suspicious.

320
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:33,438
Something happened
between you and Wan that night?

321
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:37,771
Ji-young.

322
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:44,729
You know that we can't have sex
without each other knowing.

323
00:39:45,021 --> 00:39:48,021
So what did you do in the alley?

324
00:39:54,188 --> 00:39:56,479
Soo-min, you can't really drink, can you?

325
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,354
Wan.

326
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:02,271
I'm sorry.

327
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,146
You don't have to be sorry.

328
00:40:04,604 --> 00:40:07,479
Your senior is supposed
to pat you on the back.

329
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,396
Are you okay?

330
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:20,313
Would you like some water?

331
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:25,146
Wan.

332
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:28,688
Could you pat a little higher?

333
00:40:33,854 --> 00:40:35,896
A little higher.

334
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:37,313
Here?

335
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:45,938
A little higher.

336
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,021
Hey.

337
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:27,438
Hey, Wan.

338
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,313
Come on, we're starting.

339
00:41:29,479 --> 00:41:31,313
Okay, I'm coming.

340
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,063
Soo-min, you're okay now, right?

341
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:37,563
I'll be inside.

342
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,813
Wan!

343
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,771
What?

344
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:52,854
I practically handed myself to you!

345
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:58,688
I'll have Wan tonight no matter what.

346
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:05,729
Is he big then?

347
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:08,063
You crazy bitch.

348
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:11,396
What are you talking about?

349
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:15,938
She's saying he patted her on the back.

350
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,229
I'm just saying...

351
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:23,938
since she says her butt and
his penis were touching.

352
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:28,938
Hey.

353
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:31,188
You're very strange.

354
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,563
Why are you overreacting?

355
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:41,396
Did something actually happen
in the bathroom with Wan?

356
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:43,938
Weird.

357
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:48,354
Everyone was using the same bathroom.

358
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:50,479
Why would I do that?

359
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:54,021
There were two stalls in the bathroom.

360
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:59,438
Of course there were 2 stalls.
It was a big bathroom.

361
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:06,188
What I'm saying is that one of the
stalls was being used that night.

362
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:21,229
Step aside, I brought the key.

363
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:02,771
Wan.

364
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,271
I think I'm going to fall.

365
00:44:14,604 --> 00:44:15,604
Wan.

366
00:44:20,521 --> 00:44:22,646
Men go in first to use the urinal.

367
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,563
And then the girls could go.

368
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,146
What are you talking about?
Women should go first.

369
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:47,729
Hey.

370
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,813
Wan, I'm scared.

371
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:15,479
Wan.

372
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:24,854
What are you doing?

373
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,104
Why not?

374
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:31,604
What are you doing?

375
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,438
What are you thinking?

376
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:46,104
I don't think there's anyone outside.
Let's get out.

377
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:48,563
Wait.

378
00:45:49,938 --> 00:45:51,146
You're wrong.

379
00:45:54,979 --> 00:45:56,979
- Hey.
- Wan.

380
00:45:57,063 --> 00:46:00,313
- Someone's coming.
- There's no one.

381
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,646
Listen, you can hear them.

382
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:05,396
- Come on.
- Hey.

383
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:15,896
Ji-young, let go.

384
00:46:16,146 --> 00:46:17,396
Stop...

385
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:21,354
Come on.

386
00:46:22,188 --> 00:46:24,063
- Let go.
- Why?

387
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:25,521
Fine.

388
00:46:26,021 --> 00:46:29,188
Let's just get out of here first.

389
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:31,479
- Hold on.
- No.

390
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:37,813
- Come on, get down first.
- No.

391
00:46:38,146 --> 00:46:40,063
- Let go.
- No.

392
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,563
Damn it.

393
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:48,188
- Why?
- What are you doing?

394
00:46:49,063 --> 00:46:50,229
Damn it.

395
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:52,188
Are you that horny?

396
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:54,063
Gosh.

397
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:03,771
What are you doing here?
People are waiting. Come on.

398
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,771
Okay, I'm going.

399
00:47:10,271 --> 00:47:11,646
Damn it.

400
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:13,938
Wan.

401
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,354
Where are you going?

402
00:47:21,229 --> 00:47:25,938
Girl, did you really want to
do it in the smelly bathroom?

403
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:31,271
Are you listening to me at all?

404
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,063
What?

405
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:34,354
What did you say?

406
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:41,646
Is that why you were looking for
a cat with Wan under the stairs?

407
00:47:43,146 --> 00:47:48,354
Let's just take this fight
to the end tonight.

408
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:51,396
I'm glad you said that.

409
00:47:51,979 --> 00:47:55,271
You knew that I liked Wan.

410
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:58,021
What did you say to him?

411
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:00,063
Do you think I'm like you?

412
00:48:00,438 --> 00:48:02,188
What did I say?

413
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:03,896
You know what you said.

414
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:09,938
You said Soo-min was waiting for him
with in the alley with her bra off.

415
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:15,771
Hey, who says that?

416
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:19,854
Wan, don't go.

417
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:23,854
Wan.

418
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:25,938
I like you.

419
00:48:28,354 --> 00:48:29,438
Wan.

420
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:32,521
Do you not like me?

421
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:35,896
Wan.

422
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:40,313
If you don't, just go.

423
00:48:47,438 --> 00:48:48,729
Wan.

424
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:52,188
Wan, it feels so good.

425
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:55,313
It's so good.

426
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,188
Yes.

427
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:20,479
Yes.

428
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,146
Wan, it feels so good.

429
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:29,604
It feels so good.

430
00:51:33,396 --> 00:51:36,229
What about you?

431
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:05,313
I heard something out here.

432
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:10,729
I heard someone screaming.

433
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,396
Strange. That was definitely a scream.

434
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:19,479
What are you doing there?

435
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,521
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

436
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:35,813
Gosh, you kids drink so much.

437
00:53:25,979 --> 00:53:27,271
Wan, yes.

438
00:53:29,854 --> 00:53:31,188
This is so good.

439
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:36,896
Do you get it now?

440
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:40,521
So nothing happened.

441
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:41,813
Soo-min.

442
00:53:42,104 --> 00:53:45,604
Then why were you holding your bra?

443
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:48,104
Only the janitor would know the place.

444
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:54,396
Girl, my Wan wouldn't
sleep with just anyone.

445
00:53:54,604 --> 00:53:55,771
What?

446
00:53:56,063 --> 00:53:57,063
Anyone?

447
00:53:57,271 --> 00:54:00,729
You know what I mean.

448
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:03,938
Eun-sook.

449
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:06,063
Are you hiding something?

450
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:08,563
Spill it now.

451
00:54:08,938 --> 00:54:12,313
What would I be hiding?

452
00:54:19,938 --> 00:54:21,063
Meow.

453
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:22,313
Meow.

454
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:24,521
- Meow.
- Meow.

455
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:26,646
- Meow.
- Meow.

456
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,271
Gosh.

457
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,021
Should we get out of here?

458
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:38,938
You should go first.

459
00:54:45,188 --> 00:54:46,313
Did you...

460
00:54:47,396 --> 00:54:48,438
What?

461
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:53,104
You should have told me that you fell.

462
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:55,229
Gosh.

463
00:54:57,979 --> 00:54:59,563
Your butt got wet too.

464
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:01,938
- Gosh.
- Wan.

465
00:55:03,271 --> 00:55:04,604
I'll do it.

466
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,354
You don't trust me?

467
00:55:09,813 --> 00:55:10,896
Just stand still.

468
01:00:53,146 --> 01:00:57,688
I was just looking for
a stray cat with Wan.

469
01:00:59,313 --> 01:01:00,479
Fine.

470
01:01:01,354 --> 01:01:04,729
You don't seem to believe me.

471
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:07,188
You know Young-sik, right?

472
01:01:08,646 --> 01:01:09,813
Ask him.

473
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:12,521
Who?

474
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:14,021
Young-sik?

475
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:17,688
Don't you remember?
He's bald and looks like Gollum.

476
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:24,354
He died in a car accidentally recently.

477
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:27,854
Don't be ridiculous.

478
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:32,938
I thought both of you were
dead when you didn't call me.

479
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:34,021
Right.

480
01:01:35,146 --> 01:01:36,479
That's true.

481
01:01:36,813 --> 01:01:40,688
It's been 3 years since
we graduated already.

482
01:01:41,396 --> 01:01:44,771
I heard about the girls the other day.

483
01:01:45,188 --> 01:01:48,979
Girls who couldn't get a job yet are
planning to be a professional wife.

484
01:01:49,813 --> 01:01:50,979
What does that mean?

485
01:01:52,104 --> 01:01:56,938
Marrying someone rich.

486
01:01:58,396 --> 01:01:59,521
Ji-young.

487
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:03,563
Didn't you hear what Wan's doing?

488
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:04,479
The last time I saw Wan
was in that bathroom.

489
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:09,813
- What happened in that bathroom anyway?
- What?

490
01:06:11,479 --> 01:06:15,688
Well, I...

491
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:21,479
What are you doing?

492
01:06:24,729 --> 01:06:26,104
Damn it.

493
01:06:30,021 --> 01:06:31,104
Stay still.

494
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,479
Wan.

495
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:25,604
Wan.

496
01:07:26,438 --> 01:07:28,104
You know I'm a virgin, right?

497
01:08:46,396 --> 01:08:49,354
Excuse me. If you don't need to go,
I really need to use the bathroom.

498
01:08:50,896 --> 01:08:55,396
I really need to go.

499
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:24,479
Just stop and come on out now.

500
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:29,229
I just can't...

501
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:31,563
stop now.

502
01:09:33,396 --> 01:09:34,896
You should use another bathroom.

503
01:10:01,438 --> 01:10:02,813
I really need to go.

504
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:10,271
So no one really did anything?

505
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:13,229
Sadly, no.

506
01:10:14,146 --> 01:10:15,771
He didn't want the same thing as me.

507
01:10:16,771 --> 01:10:20,229
Even if we weren't really
going out with him,

508
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:22,188
what matter is the reality.

509
01:10:27,146 --> 01:10:32,021
But why isn't Eun-sook here yet?

510
01:10:32,188 --> 01:10:33,271
Guys.

511
01:10:37,896 --> 01:10:39,438
I'm sorry I'm late.

512
01:10:44,688 --> 01:10:46,771
Goodness, are you...

513
01:10:46,896 --> 01:10:48,313
Are you Eun-sook?

514
01:10:48,563 --> 01:10:52,396
Gosh, when did you get married?

515
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:54,771
We didn't have a wedding yet.

516
01:10:55,896 --> 01:10:58,354
You know who this is, right?

517
01:11:00,396 --> 01:11:03,438
My husband Wan.

518
01:11:04,438 --> 01:11:06,604
Hi.

519
01:11:11,896 --> 01:11:14,979
Welcome. Would you like me to
get a table next to this one?

520
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:38,021
It's nice to see you again.

521
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:39,563
How have you been?

522
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:45,271
Oh Ji-young.

523
01:11:45,771 --> 01:11:48,813
You're so much prettier
than you were in school.

524
01:11:49,313 --> 01:11:51,771
Do you remember what
happened in the bathroom?

525
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:54,438
Wan, let's do a shot.

526
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,688
Sure.

527
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:17,021
So-Ra, do you remember?

528
01:12:17,438 --> 01:12:18,688
At the stairs.

529
01:12:19,146 --> 01:12:23,354
Goodness, Wan. Their fish
cakes are really good.

530
01:12:23,688 --> 01:12:24,896
Try it.

531
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:27,021
What? Okay.

532
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:28,396
Sure.

533
01:12:29,854 --> 01:12:31,313
- Soo-min.
- Wan.

534
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:34,854
I forgot about the past long time ago.

535
01:12:35,688 --> 01:12:38,021
It's been so long.
Let's have a toast.

536
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:16,896
Goodness, I should take this.

537
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:32,563
My stomach hurts.

538
01:13:44,146 --> 01:13:45,313
Damn it.

539
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:05,938
Fuck.

540
01:14:13,604 --> 01:14:15,146
First love...

541
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:18,938
is just a dream.

542
01:14:21,688 --> 01:14:22,938
Women of virtue?

543
01:14:24,771 --> 01:14:26,229
Screw it.

544
01:14:41,313 --> 01:14:45,438
I must have lost my mind.

545
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:49,146
How did I like someone like that?

546
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:56,146
My virginity!

547
01:14:57,021 --> 01:14:59,479
What am I going to do?

548
01:15:11,521 --> 01:15:14,521
Damn it, I can't cry at all.

549
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,563
What? Virginity?

550
01:15:29,396 --> 01:15:30,813
Fuck it.

551
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:37,646
I'm never going to date
anyone with the same name.

552
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:43,146
(3 women)

553
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:44,979
Hello?

554
01:17:02,313 --> 01:17:03,813
(And a man)

555
01:17:11,521 --> 01:17:12,854
Here, kitty.

556
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,771
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes.

557
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:20,354
(At the "Single Bar")

558
01:17:21,688 --> 01:17:22,729
Goodness!

559
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,354
(Erotic)

560
01:17:41,146 --> 01:17:42,146
Wan!

561
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:44,771
(Three love)

562
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:55,854
(Three seduction)
