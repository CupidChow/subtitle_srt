1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
At one going

2
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,500
Who dares to功

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,940
To face yourке

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,140
Wave at the wind

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:57,040
선와의

6
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,980
Kid

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,780
You're still a little bit slow.

8
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,100
Now that I've made it to the big game,

9
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,700
you're running out of ideas.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,300
Running out of ideas?

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,180
Father,

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,260
have you ever heard of the God's hand?

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,980
What?

14
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,140
The God's hand?

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,380
Then it's the Heaven's will.

16
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,180
The Heaven's hand.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,420
I've lost.

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,540
When can you stop?

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,620
I didn't notice at all.

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,340
Are you that good now?

21
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,380
I've lived for so many years.

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,140
I'm not a fool.

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,260
Come on, practice more.

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,260
Go, go, go.

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,220
Young Master,

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,420
Miss Li Yanran wants to go to Li's house for you.

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,300
Li Yanran wants to see me?

28
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,580
Why?

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,580
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Miss Li asked you to go.

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,180
Then hurry up and go.

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:04,980
Go, go, go.

33
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,180
What?

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,980
Hurry up and go.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:07,580
Okay, okay.

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,180
Here.

37
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,780
God bless, God bless.

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,580
My Feiyang finally has a girlfriend.

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,580
Bless, bless, bless, bless.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,580
Bless, bless, bless.

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,580
Bless, bless, bless.

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Okay, you'll know when you come.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,580
You should be more enthusiastic.

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,580
This is...

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,580
You, you're here.

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,580
I've seen Uncle and Aunt.

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,980
Feiyang is here.

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,980
Sit down.

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,580
Come, come, come.

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,380
Come inside.

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,380
Hurry up.

52
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,780
Please, please.

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,980
Feiyang, come.

54
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,980
I'll fill it for you.

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,780
I wish you a good result in the future.

56
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
You'll be a great model.

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,980
You'll be a great model for me.

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,980
You'll be a great model for me.

59
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,980
You'll be a great model for me.

60
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,980
You'll be a great model for me.

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,980
You'll be a great model for me.

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,580
Come.

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:11,780
Okay.

64
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,580
I'm here to discuss with you

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,580
about what happened.

66
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,980
When did you and Yanran

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
get engaged?

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,980
G... Geng?

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,780
Yes.

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,180
Your father and I

71
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,980
have already engaged.

72
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,980
You're the only one in the Zhao family.

73
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,980
So you're the one who's in trouble.

74
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,380
I always think

75
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,180
it's good to see my wife.

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,380
But I'm always nervous

77
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,580
when I see this.

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,380
Uncle.

79
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,180
Why don't you discuss this with my father?

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,180
It's because

81
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,380
you have three children.

82
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,780
I'm also a little selfish.

83
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,580
I hope Yanran can be a great model.

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,380
You don't know how to talk, do you?

85
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,180
Of course not.

86
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
Father, I've made a promise.

87
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,380
I'll treat Feiyang to a meal today.

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,980
It's for your own good.

89
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,580
Feiyang, don't listen to my father.

90
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,180
I'm looking for you today

91
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,780
to have a simple meal.

92
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,780
It's not meaningful.

93
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,380
Okay, okay.

94
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,380
Come on.

95
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Let's have a drink.

96
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,380
Come on.

97
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,980
Please.

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,580
Yanran,

99
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,180
I've found a place to rest.

100
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
Let's...

101
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,780
Bajie.

102
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,380
Zhao Feiyang,

103
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
why are you here?

104
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm here to have a meal.

105
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,980
You're here to have a meal with your family?

106
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,780
Yes.

107
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,780
I was invited.

108
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,980
You were invited.

109
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,580
What?

110
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
What's the problem?

111
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,180
What's going on?

112
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
With Zhao Feiyang's

113
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,980
reputation in Tianxuan City,

114
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,180
he's invited to have a meal with his family.

115
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,180
And he looks like a good model.

116
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,580
Yanran, why are you still standing here?

117
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,580
Your sister is here.

118
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,180
Why don't you invite her to the meal?

119
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm sorry, Bajie.

120
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,180
I was just born.

121
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Since you're here,

122
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,580
let's have a meal together.

123
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,380
Let Chu Ge have a few dishes.

124
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:17,980
Yes.

125
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
I'll toast you.

126
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,980
Okay.

127
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Old man,

128
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,180
are you drunk?

129
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,980
How can I be drunk?

130
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,780
Come on.

131
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm drunk.

132
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
I'm drunk.

133
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm drunk.

134
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:38,980
This wine...

135
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,780
I'm not drunk.

136
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,380
It's just a little bit.

137
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
It's not good.

138
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,380
Don't be so sad.

139
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Eat more.

140
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,980
The fish in the net is still good.

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,380
It tastes the same as when I was a kid.

142
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Why are you looking at me?

143
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
Have a meal.

144
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
Here.

145
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,980
All right.

146
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,780
Just a chicken leg.

147
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,180
Here you go.

148
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,180
Eat.

149
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,380
Are you hiding something from me?

150
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,380
What's so special about you?

151
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,380
Sister Bai Zhi,

152
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,380
didn't you say that there's a good place to practice?

153
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Let's go together.

154
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Are you changing the topic, Yan Ran?

155
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
No.

156
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
The dance meeting is in a hurry.

157
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
If you want to practice,

158
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
let's hurry up and grab some time.

159
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
I was going to call you first,

160
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
but I'll call you Sister Qiu Shui.

161
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,380
Call her?

162
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,380
I'm not going. I'm not going to talk to her.

163
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Then...

164
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
Then don't call her.

165
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,380
Sister Qiu Shui doesn't like to be called.

166
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Fine.

167
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Then let's go.

168
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,380
Okay.

169
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Here it is.

170
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
Someone dares to break into here?

171
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,380
What practice is this?

172
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,380
There's a border.

173
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,380
What's going on?

174
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Zhao Feiyang and Yan Ran are together.

175
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
They're related.

176
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,380
Don't think too much.

177
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,380
It's exactly what you think.

178
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm not going to call her.

179
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,380
It's exactly what you think.

180
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
What do I think?

181
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Sister Qiu Shui.

182
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,380
We were outside and we were forced into the border.

183
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,380
So we came in together.

184
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,380
How did the three of you come in together?

185
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Anyway, it's a coincidence.

186
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,380
That's really a coincidence.

187
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,380
You're really my sister Qiu Shui.

188
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,380
You let me go and bring the dog with me to this place.

189
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Dog?

190
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Chen Qiu Shui, you're going to marry me again?

191
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Don't talk to me.

192
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,380
I can hear you talking and I feel disgusting.

193
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
You...

194
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,380
You bastard.

195
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
You resigned?

196
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,380
You can't think of it?

197
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
You'd better be in the Martial Arts Contest and not meet me.

198
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,380
I'm going to kill you.

199
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,380
I'll make you regret it.

200
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
I regret it now.

201
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
After the Martial Arts Contest,

202
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,380
before we go to the North, let's get married.

203
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm not in a good mood with you.

204
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
What did you say?

205
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
I said, get married.

206
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
Who can be so cruel?

207
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,380
There are three ways to live a life.

208
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,380
How many times have I been cruel?

209
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
How sweet is the cold spring?

210
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,380
I'm happy.

211
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,380
I'm drunk. I'm drunk. I'm drunk. I'm drunk.

212
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,380
Who is the person who has a warm face?

213
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,380
How can I live with tears?

214
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
I'm not a good person.

215
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,380
How can I be nice to him?

216
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,380
Who can be so cruel?
