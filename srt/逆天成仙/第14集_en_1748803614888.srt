1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Congratulations, Fourth Brother.

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Fourth Brother,

3
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,240
it seems that

4
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm almost married.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,160
Fifth Brother.

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
When will you

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,560
find me a younger sister-in-law

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,360
and bring her back to our Zhao family

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,720
to celebrate the wedding?

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,680
I don't care.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,400
I haven't met the right one.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,560
By the way, Yifeng,

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,760
didn't we say that

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,280
before Master Xiao came back,

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,360
I would practice with you first?

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm here today.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
How about...

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Forget it.

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
Tomorrow is the day of the revolution.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,360
It's the day of the revolution.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,480
What's the use of it?

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Besides,

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,200
I don't want her to be in the battlefield.

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,920
The ultimate goal of the Five Great Lakes

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,040
is to choose the leader of the team.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Our Zhao family

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,840
has been paid by the Empire of Heaven and Earth.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,120
There are too many.

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,320
The task of Wei Yang

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
is to marry the seven children.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,080
This is the result

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
that I want to see the most.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,960
Although it's hard to be a man,

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,280
there's no need

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,160
for this time.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,040
What do you think, Wei Yang?

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,400
Father,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm going to go to the north.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,640
You...

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
What if something happens?

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Do you think

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm your father?

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm sorry, father.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
I can understand you.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,760
But if I don't go,

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
the whole Tianxuan City

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,040
will definitely kill me.

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
This is a big deal.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,720
But...

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,240
You really know how to say beautiful things.

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
Father, don't worry.

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm not a useless man.

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
I won't die in the battlefield.

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,640
I'll let you

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,480
send the hundred people to the Black River.

56
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Fine.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,920
Fine.

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,400
If you had such an idea,

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
it would be great.

60
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,160
Since I'm here,

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,360
I'm Zhao Wei Yang.

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
The three brothers are willing to save me.

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,560
I have to repay their kindness.

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
But I have no choice.

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
I still have to make the list.

66
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,920
Since you're so ambitious,

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,280
why don't we start the training now?

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll train as a fifth brother.

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
No need.

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
No need.

71
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,080
No need.

72
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,880
Think about it.

73
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,760
You need to learn more.

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Then you'll have more

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,800
self-sufficiency in the battlefield.

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,400
Right?

77
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,600
Start training tomorrow.

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
Since father said so,

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,480
train.

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Fine.

81
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,920
I won't give you this useless thing tomorrow.

82
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,600
Time is tight.

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,400
I didn't find out that Master Xiao started from the beginning.

84
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,320
Fourth Brother,

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm going to train you in the way of the actual battle.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,640
Master,

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,160
is the actual battle too dangerous?

88
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
Feng'er,

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,760
be careful.

90
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't hurt your fourth brother.

91
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
You can watch the rest.

92
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,720
Is it necessary?

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
Of course.

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
The actual battle is the best way to train.

95
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Fourth Brother, don't be afraid.

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,240
I won't hurt you.

97
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm not afraid.

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,040
I just...

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
You brat.

101
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
You said beautiful words yesterday.

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
What's wrong with you today?

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,560
You're a coward.

104
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm not a coward.

105
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm just afraid of being a fifth brother.

106
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,320
Being a fifth brother?

107
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,440
Don't worry, Fourth Brother.

108
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,200
I won't be as stupid as Master Xiao.

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
We're brothers after all.

110
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,440
I'll be very patient.

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
This sword is called the Golden Rain.

112
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,200
It's the sword of the sky and the sky.

113
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,160
It's like ice and frost when it's first seen.

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
When it's back,

115
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,800
the sword is moving the cold shadow of the bone.

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Fourth Brother,

117
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,080
if you can't stand the cold and cold wings later,

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'll stop it immediately.

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
Is that so?

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,640
If you didn't mean to

121
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,760
have a father and a son for ten years,

122
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,240
I wouldn't have left you a single life.

123
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,360
But I'll teach you a lesson.

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
It's a good thing to make you wake up.

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Well...

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,640
This sword is called the Iron Sword.

127
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,880
When you're out of the sword, you sit down and think about it.

128
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,080
You have to break it anytime.

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
When you're back,

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,160
you can use the Iron Blood and Iron Embroidery to break it.

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,800
If you can't stand the cold and cold wings later,

132
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,760
I'll spare your life.

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,840
I'll stop it immediately.

134
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,960
Fourth Brother, you're so generous.

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,160
I'm so stupid.

136
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,760
Am I a wild boar?

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,160
How can I feel that

138
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,080
Heng'er is being suppressed?

139
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,120
Old Master,

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,040
actually, it's the fifth year that you're being suppressed.

141
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
You'll feel that

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,680
the fifth year is being suppressed.

143
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,920
You know the power of the fourth lord, right?

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,040
Old Master,

145
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,800
Heng'er is not bad.

146
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
You know how to be suppressed.

147
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
Master, it's not like that.

148
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
The two are very good.

149
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,000
The young master will win the fifth lord.

150
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
It's him.

151
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,480
He can win.

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
This little girl is talking nonsense again.

153
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,680
You've been following the young master since you were a kid.

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
She's a few gold and silver.

155
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,360
Don't you know that?

156
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,880
No, no, no.

157
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,720
In my eyes,

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
the young master is invincible.

159
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,760
You're a good young master.

160
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,920
What a great expression!

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,480
Master,

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
you're good.

163
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Even in the middle of crisp front,

164
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,240
what can you cook?

165
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,000
How can he be that young master?

166
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,800
Dad,

167
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,320
you need to be focused first.

168
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
You are my life.

169
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,120
Hurry!

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,440
You're my car.

171
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
You're Math Wise.

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
Heart wrenching master.

173
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,240
progress.

174
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm not bad.

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
I'm not bad at all.

176
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,080
I understand.

177
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
Since you can't fight me,

178
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,160
I can only fight Xiuwei.

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,760
I'm sorry, Zi Ge.

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
If I kill you,

181
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,680
you'll be in trouble.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
Father,

183
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,520
you're really like this.

184
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,960
Zi Ge.

185
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,480
Stop fighting me.

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,320
Why?

187
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,480
Heng, you're dead.

188
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Dead?

189
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm dead?

190
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
What are you talking about?

191
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Did you burn it?

192
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm sorry, Father.

193
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Just now,

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,240
I felt that you used

195
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,720
the spirit power of the ten tribes.

196
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,680
You're not even a warrior.

197
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,440
You can't do this.

198
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,400
Who said you shouldn't?

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,320
If I didn't use the spirit power,

200
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,680
I would be dead now.

201
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Fei Yang,

202
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,200
what's going on?

203
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
Did I do something wrong?

204
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Did I do something else?

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,800
Yes.

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,960
He's not even a warrior.

207
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,280
Heng.

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
Heng is just a corpse.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Luckily,

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,800
he didn't cause a big trouble.

211
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,520
All right.

212
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,720
It's okay.

213
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,240
Fei Yang, are you okay?

214
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm fine.

215
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,920
Fifth Brother,

216
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,600
are you still practicing?

217
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,560
No.

218
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Why not?

219
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520
Didn't you just

220
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
ask me to practice for you?

221
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
I...

222
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,680
I suddenly felt a little sick.

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,280
I thought I'd go back and rest.

224
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
You're not feeling well.

225
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Where?

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,880
Do you want to see a doctor?

227
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,080
No.

228
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,840
Father,

229
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,480
Fourth Brother,

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
I'll take my leave.

231
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Have a good rest.

232
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
Have a good rest.

233
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,960
Fei Yang,

234
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,640
do you really want to report to me tonight?

235
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,200
Father,

236
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,120
I've made a decision.

237
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
I won't change.

238
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,160
Do you really

239
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,560
have no doubts?

240
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,840
Yes.

241
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,960
All right.

242
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
I know you're in the mood.

243
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,360
We all despise you.

244
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,520
We all despise you.

245
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,840
I also sometimes dislike you.

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,120
But,

247
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
this is not my intention.

248
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
All right, father.

249
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,360
Father,

250
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,320
why do you suddenly say such a rude thing?

251
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,120
It's not like your style.

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
When I can't give my son

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,840
a new life,

254
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,120
do you feel like it?

255
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,200
Yes.

256
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,240
Yes.

257
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,880
In fact,

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
it doesn't matter

259
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,720
what you're good at.

260
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
What matters is

261
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,880
I can watch you

262
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,800
and be safe.

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,200
I see.

264
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm sorry.

268
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm sorry.

269
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm sorry.

274
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
I'm sorry.

278
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
I'm sorry.

282
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm sorry.

290
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I'm sorry.

291
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I'm sorry.
