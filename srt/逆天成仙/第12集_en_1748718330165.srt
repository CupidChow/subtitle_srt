1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't want to

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
The hot summer

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
Who dares to break free

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The wind is blowing

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wind is blowing

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The wind is blowing

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The wind is blowing

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's go to the 21st floor

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've been running since I was a kid

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't die behind you

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I just want to see you

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I hope you can make it

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Listen to the autumn water

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Forget it

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's cheaper today

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We can guarantee you a good life

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You get some resources

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can leave without a reason

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you hear me

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The 21st floor is really okay

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are not kind enough

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't mind if you are willing to take you with you

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Shut up

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dear elders

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm Qiu Shui

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please come to the bed

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you all come to the bed?

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How many floors are there?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
18

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
18

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My brother

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How can a young girl like you

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
be so mature now?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Tian Tian

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
She said 18 floors

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Misunderstanding

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I thought you were 18 years old

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't be greedy

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Good for you

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Before the bed

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I have something to give you

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Dear elders

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's take it

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This jade sword

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You must keep it well

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you want to withdraw

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Three people are together

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can take the jade sword

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and get out of here

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I understand

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Open the fire

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The 18th floor

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
is a martial arts competition

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Killing them

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
will have the opportunity

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to get the golden iron

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If you are lucky

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you can get the golden iron

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can take it out

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and use the golden iron weapon

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In case you are out of the world

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can't even use the weapon

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You know it's for me

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are so weird

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Come on

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Haa

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fui

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
People

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
ðŸŽµ

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Ah

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She doesn't know

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
whichword is the black sword

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
as I've seen this

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
After this soul pet

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,600
you can educaciÃ³n you

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,120
but you're not obedient to the notion of giving up on the baby.

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,560
You're american.

83
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,200
Did she 000 me to get her?

84
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,080
Ours?

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,140
What business would you want her to do with you?

86
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
A prince has never put

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
I need to pass through the gate to open the next door.

88
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,000
The formation is a bit too high.

89
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,600
But it's good that I can see more fruits in my life.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
I should be able to solve it.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I did it.

92
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
What are you doing?

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm leaving first. Bye.

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
What's going on?

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Where is Daliang?

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I should have been attacked by this.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
How is that possible?

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
There is no chance.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I should have been attacked by this.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
How is that possible?

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Before we killed the spirit body,

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
the formation wouldn't have been activated.

103
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
I don't know either.

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I think it's because of the formation.

105
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
He is not even a warrior.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
He passed through the 19th floor alone.

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Did he push out the jade seal?

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
What's the difference between this and Song's death?

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Brother, let's send him down quickly.

110
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Your cultivation skill can't last for a long time.

111
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Let's do it again quickly.

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
No, he can't die here.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I brought him in.

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
If he dies in this tower,

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
he will think that I'm using a special skill

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
to break through the gate.

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll kill him here.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You bastard.

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Where is the jade seal?

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
It seems that it was just taken away.

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Which god can burn the 33th floor?

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm afraid that the cultivation skill is not normal.

123
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
He can't even make it faster.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Only 7 years of fire will be re-enact.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Even if he has 7 years of body,

126
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
it's useless to get the jade seal.

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Get the jade seal.

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
We can't defeat him in 25 years.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
But...

130
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
No, but he might die.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
We can't let him die.

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
It's a big deal.

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
You bastard.

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
You're the one who killed yourself.

135
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
You bastard.

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
What's going on?

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
This jade seal is so strong that we can't defeat him.

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
It's changed.

139
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Jade seal, hurry up.

140
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
It's a jade seal.

141
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Be careful, Jade seal.

142
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Hurry up.

143
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Qiu Shui.

144
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Qiu Shui.

145
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
General, I'm going to find someone to save you.

146
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
This is...

147
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Finally, we got the jade seal.

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
We got the jade seal.

149
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Master Xiao.

150
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
With a few jades,

151
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
we got 33 levels.

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Yes, yes.

153
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Wu Pei Xiuwei.

154
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
We got 33 levels.

155
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
I'll give you a chance.

156
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Thank you for your time.

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I can't take it.

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
You're so strong.

159
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
You're the one I can't take.

160
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
You're so strong.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Look, Master Xiao has left.

162
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
You scared him away.

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
You look so innocent.

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Do you know that?

165
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
You're the one who's innocent.

166
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
You're the one who's innocent.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
You're the one who's innocent.

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm innocent.

169
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
You're the one who's innocent.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
Xiao You.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Why are you out alone?

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
You're in the same situation.

173
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Don't you have two more?

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
We've been in this situation for 15 levels.

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm afraid...

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
That's true.

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Poor Chen Qushunyao.

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
He's in the same situation.

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
He's in the same situation.

180
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
So,

181
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
the same situation is really a holy place for cultivation.

182
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,600
He's also lost too many lives.

183
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
That's right.

184
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
You two can go to save him.

185
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm afraid he can still come.

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
You...

187
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
You don't know, Xiao You.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
I only allow him to be in the same situation.

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
He can't interfere with anything in the tower.

190
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
That's right.

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
So,

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
he's never been in the same situation.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
He can't go to any level in the tower

194
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,600
as he wants.

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
This matter...

196
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
can't be stopped.

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Can't be stopped.

198
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Zhao Fuyang.

199
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
You're just a coward.

200
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Come on.

201
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Wait.

202
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Wait.

203
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
After the person in the tower is dead,

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
the person in the tower will be sent out.

205
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
You need to help them.

206
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Help them both.

207
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I have to push Zhao Fuyang out of the tower.

208
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Otherwise,

209
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Chen's family will be in trouble.

210
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
He's going to be married.

211
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
You...

212
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
He's going to be married?

213
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
That's too dangerous.

214
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
That's not a good idea.

215
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I...

216
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I...

217
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
I...

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I...

219
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
I...

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I...

221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
I...

222
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I...

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I...

224
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I...

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
I...

226
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
I...

227
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
I...

228
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I...

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
I...

230
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I...

231
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I...

232
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I've been in the tower for years.

233
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I haven't been able to get out of the tower.

234
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I...

235
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
I'll teach you to get out of the tower.

236
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm not happy.

237
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm not happy.

238
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not happy.

239
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
I'm not happy.
