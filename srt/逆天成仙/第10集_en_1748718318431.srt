1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't want to be with you

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to be with you

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who dares to break the promise

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't want to be with you

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't want to be with you

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't want to be with you

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't want to be with you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why did you bring me here?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course it's to treat wounds

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What for?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The water in this world is cold

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But cold water can relieve the acidity of your muscles

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And my special recipe

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can absorb it faster

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Special recipe

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the top mushroom rice

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The mushroom rice is under the cultivation of this era

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But it's not worth the treasure

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's just for me

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm touched

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why are you laughing?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The thing you put in the water

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's very expensive

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why do you waste it on me?

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a matter of appearance

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's expensive

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Besides

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm your future teacher

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I should do something for you

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You just have to practice

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There will be more surprises

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There will be more progress

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you for what?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You just have to practice

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You should be a dancer

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's my biggest thanks

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm a weak-willed man

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not single

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I missed the best time of practice

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a rich man now

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Can I be a dancer?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Before the dance conference

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You must be

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm touched again

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, you can keep it

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's better to keep it

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You took off your clothes

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You will have a good effect on your clothes

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not taking off my clothes

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's more than 300 jin

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me help you

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't, don't

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Teacher Xiao, do you have a girlfriend?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm still...

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't call me a girl

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm eight years older than you

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are just a child

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm not a child

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm already very old

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why waste time?

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I...

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Damn it

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm so embarrassed

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have to take revenge

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's the harm to a man?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are now a transfer agent

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You should play the game of HanQuan

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and absorb the medicine into the bones

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I...

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't see

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I just know

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
he has just confessed

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He has that kind of感覺

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
about being apmching

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I guess

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How sad

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
potem

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm free

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do I need to do it?

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:17,080
Abraham's

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,700
Give me one more period.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,720
What?

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Mr. Xiao, I'm kidding.

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,680
It's quite comfortable inside.

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,680
You should try it.

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
Young Master, what did you do yesterday?

92
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
What did you do with your eyes?

93
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,560
It's a matter of adults.

94
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
Stop it.

95
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,200
Son, let me tell you something.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
What are you running about?

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,400
Chuan,

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Master Xiao said he was going to continue today.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,560
Why hasn't he come yet?

100
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't think Master Xiao is a person who is heartless.

101
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
Is something wrong?

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
Last night,

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,920
Master Xiao took this boy out for a chat.

104
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,600
What happened?

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,920
There's no one beside him on earth.

106
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,920
If I do go to touch him...

107
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Be casual.

108
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,040
Mr. Xiao...

109
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm afraid you wouldn't tell us anything.

110
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
We can talk later tonight.

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,480
Never mind.

112
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
J kneeling to Nanny

113
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
so easily can you accept your destiny?

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,080
No?

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,240
I thought the group has been dealing with the devil.

116
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,360
But the villagers didn't listen to me.

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
They even hurt me.

118
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,120
They didn't put our royal family in the eyes.

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,120
How dare you!

120
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,520
Although Tianxuan City is a small city in the south,

121
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,200
it's difficult to find a place in the country.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,920
They don't need to take the summon.

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
They'll gather soldiers at the first time

124
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
and go to the enemy to kill them.

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,000
A few months ago,

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
the devil of the Bajie Army

127
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
contributed a lot to the battle.

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,760
I also heard

129
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
that they're preparing for the Martial Arts Conference.

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,880
They're the main personnel of the Martial Arts Team.

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
And you're actually doing this.

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Fu Chuo, I just...

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
Are you still trying to trick me

134
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,480
to do something in Tianxuan City?

135
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,880
You really don't have any shame in your name.

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
You're really a loser.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,720
Why?

138
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,680
It's okay if someone else talks about me as a loser.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,960
Fu Chuo, you said the same thing.

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm your own son.

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,600
You know you're my own son, too.

142
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,240
Your two brothers are sisters.

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,880
They're not the same.

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
But you're really a loser.

145
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,200
Fu... Fu Chuo, if you're going to make me angry,

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
why don't you kill me?

147
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,000
Do you want to use this cruel habit again?

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,000
I...

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm serious.

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Forget it.

151
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,840
No matter how much Tianxuan City is loyal to the country,

152
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,520
it's just a place for a play.

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
In the past decades,

154
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,920
there won't be any useful talents.

155
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,440
And you, the prince,

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,080
are so cruel and humiliating.

157
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I did lose my face to the royal family.

158
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,200
But, Fu Chuo, you're helping me.

159
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,600
Go find the Yuzhu Ge Hong of the south county.

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
Let her help you find some face.

161
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,480
I'll give you the chance to choose

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
the Yuzhu Ge Hong of Tianxuan City.

163
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,360
You're a good man.

164
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,720
You're a good man.

165
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,960
Can a small Tianxuan City

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,320
stand it?

167
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,880
Yes, it can.

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Fu Chuo, don't worry.

169
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,720
If I go,

170
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,960
I'll make a great deal of it.

171
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,840
You're up.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
Get lost.

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,280
I'll take my leave.

174
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,200
Zhao Fei Yang, right?

175
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
I don't care if you make a mistake.

176
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,520
I'll make you pay for it this time.

177
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Miss Bai, sorry.

178
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
This old house

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
is not renovated for a long time.

180
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
So it's a bit messy.

181
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Boss Liu, this is the 500-lens stone.

182
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,920
I hope you can return it to your room.

183
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,040
The 500-lens stone is the price before.

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,240
Now, I think it's at least 1000-lens.

185
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,320
What did you say?

186
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,800
1000-lens?

187
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Miss Bai, you know nothing.

188
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,960
The war in the north and the south of the country

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,040
has caused a lot of wars in Tianxuan City.

190
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,360
This caused a lot of damage to the house and the shop.

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
But it's been months.

192
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
The market is gradually warming up.

193
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,280
The price you offered

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
was a few months ago.

195
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,360
The price is definitely a bit more.

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
But it's a bit too much

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
to turn it over.

198
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,320
I've made the 500-lens stone for many years.

199
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,480
500 more?

200
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
How do I get it?

201
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,880
Miss Bai,

202
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
why don't you consider more?

203
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Or do you have something worthy?

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
I heard that

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,320
you have a holy lotus seed.

206
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,520
This is a great item for cultivating.

207
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,280
It's worth the most.

208
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,520
500-lens.

209
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,000
If you're really cute,

210
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,120
I'll give you the house.

211
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
Miss Bai,

212
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,760
the market is changing day by day.

213
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,120
Today is the price.

214
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
Tomorrow is not the day.

215
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,560
If it's too long,

216
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,800
you'll have to pay for it.

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,560
But...

218
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,960
Miss Bai, to be honest,

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
you have a lot of people

220
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,120
who have been watching this for days.

221
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,000
If you're bought first,

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
you'll be...

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,920
too regretful.

224
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,720
Fine.

225
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
I'll give you.

226
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,640
Buy it if you want.

227
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a broken house.

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
What's the good thing about it?

229
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,920
You're Zhao Fei Yang?

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm not a good person.

231
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm just a good person.

232
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm just a good person.

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm just a good person.

234
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,280
I'm just a good person.

235
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
I'm just a good person.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm just a good person.

237
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,720
I'm just a good person.

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,120
I'm just a good person.

239
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm just a good person.

240
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm just a good person.

241
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm just a good person.

242
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm just a good person.

243
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,120
I'm just a good person.

244
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm just a good person.

245
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm just a good person.

246
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,720
I'm just a good person.

247
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm just a good person.

248
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
I'm just a good person.

249
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm just a good person.

250
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm just a good person.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm just a good person.

252
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm just a good person.

253
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
I'm just a good person.

254
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm just a good person.

255
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm just a good person.

256
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm just a good person.

257
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,280
I'm just a good person.

258
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,920
I'm just a good person.

259
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
I'm just a good person.

260
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I'm just a good person.

261
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm just a good person.

262
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
I'm just a good person.

263
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm just a good person.

264
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,680
My affection just didn't let me leave it,

265
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,560
though we construct a modern scenery always in nature.

266
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,200
Then why a new nature?

267
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,480
Isn't it not too far from ourselves?

268
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,360
The old roughness is torture.

269
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm just a cold person.

270
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Our horizons are so romantic.

271
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
Other people who look forward to them

272
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,440
should also be someone who loves and marries.

273
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,480
I have been talking with my lover since I was young.
