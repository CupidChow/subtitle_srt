1
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,120
کو

2
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
The day has finally come.

3
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,440
My master is very excited and begins?

4
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,820
Greatge...

5
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,960
Stop!

6
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,500
You can't beat

7
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,740
tomorrow's让 explainant Huanyi.

8
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,640
Greatge...

9
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
after you growал,

10
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,680
you'll also

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,140
reach the top of the real world.

12
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,140
What's the bottom ofoming?

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,800
Wutao will destroyed

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
the most powerful creation

15
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,840
in my heart range.

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,800
And

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,640
We have land.

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
I'll kill them now.

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,640
Leave them to me.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm the one who killed Zhao family.

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm the one who killed Duan Zi.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
You don't know that

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
the three great Zhao family

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
were forced to fight for the throne

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
to protect the royal family.

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Isn't that so?

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
I heard that when they just found the throne,

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
they were still in the dark.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
But no one could save them.

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
The Imperial Palace.

31
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
It seems to be moving.

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
I think you're a wild flower.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Three Palace.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
It's moving again.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I saw it.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
No, look.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Did you get killed

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
when I was in the dark?

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Where is this?

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Your Highness.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I'll go to the living hall.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Zhao family

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
is alive.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Go.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm actually

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
passing on the other world's

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Prince Zhao's son.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
God,

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
please let me live again.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
What's the point?

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
My Lord,

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
please let me live again.

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
My Lord, you're not a ghost.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
My Lord, you're not dead.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
You bastard.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
You're not dead.

57
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
My Lord.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Deng Zhu,

59
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,800
what's the matter?

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
My Lord,

61
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
the three great Zhao family

62
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
of the Chen family

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
are in the Zhao family.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
They've been waiting for you for a long time.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
The three brothers of our family

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
just died.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
They came here

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
to discuss the divorce.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
The three of them

70
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
didn't come to the divorce.

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
They came here

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
to have a trip.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
They're Zhao's wives.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
This...

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Isn't this

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
a joke on my wound?

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
The three brothers of the family

78
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
just died.

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
How can I

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
have a trip?

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
My Lord.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
My Lord.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
My Lord.

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
My Lord.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
My Lord.

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
You're so rude.

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Please sit down.

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
I heard

89
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
the three of you

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
came here to have a wedding.

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Although the four of us

92
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
just died,

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
we were born in the dead.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
It's just that

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
the things that don't fight,

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I...

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Uncle Zhao,

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
the three of the Zhao family

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
didn't fight against the demons

100
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
and died in the north.

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
I, Chen Li Bai,

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
joined the family to get married here.

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
The people of Tianxuan City

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
think

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
we're the kind of

106
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
who are loyal to each other.

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
The way I think about

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Qiu Shui and I,

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I...

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I...

111
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm also...

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Don't you really dislike

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
my useless son?

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
He...

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
He really doesn't deserve you?

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Of course not.

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
The three of the Zhao family

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
are the children of the heavens

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
who practice the chess.

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
And the four of them, Zhao Fei Yang,

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
are born without any single day.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
They can't even practice

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
the most basic things.

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Compared to the others,

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
they're the same age

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
but they're more natural.

127
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Since you can't see me,

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
why are you still marrying me?

129
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Do you have any money?

130
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Shut up.

131
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
How can you be so rude?

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Zhiyun, continue.

133
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
There's still one month before the engagement.

134
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
If he can practice the chess

135
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
within one month,

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
he can't get into the path

137
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
and surpass the three of us,

138
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
the three of us

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
will agree to marry him.

140
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Anyway,

141
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
he's the one who can't be saved.

142
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
The three of us

143
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
can only get married here.

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Look.

145
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I guess you're right.

146
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Zhiyun,

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Wei Mian is too sweet.

148
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
She's also too sweet.

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
She's been practicing for 18 years

150
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
and has not gotten into the path.

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
How can she

152
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
surpass the three of you

153
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
within one month?

154
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Just say,

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Qiu Shui is your daughter.

156
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You're already

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
five to three now.

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Even if the Wolf is here,

159
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
I don't dare to say

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
it's completely surpassed you.

161
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
What about her?

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
The master

163
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
is the one who was before three months.

164
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Now, Wei Mian is yours.

165
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Wei Mian is four.

166
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Even I'm three.

167
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm sorry, Uncle Zhao.

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Qiu Shui

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
also thought about

170
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
the three of us.

171
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
If we're going to get married,

172
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
the three of us

173
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
will be separated.

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
In Tianxuan City,

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
it's not a big deal.

176
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Look at our relationship

177
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
for many years.

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Please understand us.

179
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Actually,

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
it's okay.

181
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I understand.

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I understand.

183
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
My father understands you,

184
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
but who do you understand?

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Marriage and such a big deal,

186
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
you three adults

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
don't show up.

188
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
But the three of you

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
don't look down on him, do they?

190
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
What do you mean?

191
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
You said you wouldn't get married.

192
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
But in fact,

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
it's impossible to complete the project.

194
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
What's the difference

195
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
between not having a face

196
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
and not having a face?

197
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
You...

198
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
This kid is so weak.

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
He actually got a hard time today.

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
I wanted to see you

201
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
in the face of the public.

202
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I didn't think it was a problem.

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Since you said that,

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I, Chen Qiu Shi,

205
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
am just a big-time person

206
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
who's going to get married.

207
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I have my own revenge.

208
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,800
How can I be so useless

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
and useless?

210
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I represent the Chen family

211
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
and the Li family.

212
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
I'm a retreat.

213
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
I represent the Li family.

214
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I'm a retreat.

215
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I...

216
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Wait.

217
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Didn't we agree?

218
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
What did we agree on?

219
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
If I can get into the dance

220
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
and surpass you,

221
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
you'll have to marry me.

222
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
What?

223
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
You won't admit it

224
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
after a while?

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Fine.

226
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Since that's the case,

227
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
then let's make a decision.

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
After a month,

229
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Tianxuan City will have a dance party

230
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
or a victory.

231
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
It will become

232
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
the leader of the Beijang.

233
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I may be a woman,

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
but I'll take her home.

235
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
You can save her.

236
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
You said

237
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
you can really surpass them

238
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
in a month?

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
To be honest,

240
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
there are some things

241
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
that can't be said.

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
Master,

243
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm back.

244
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm back.

245
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm a retreat.
