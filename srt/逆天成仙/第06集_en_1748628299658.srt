1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,740
Here...

2
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,020
What is the eon?

3
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,860
It's Jiuhou Right?

4
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,020
This is an eon?

5
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,300
The two brothers and sisters.

6
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,360
I think Zhao Fei Yang

7
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,140
has gotten boulders

8
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,440
and have to back

9
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,900
like this to make people worry.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
I wonder if he has any problem

11
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,560
with his cultivation.

12
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,840
That's his own business.

13
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Why should he do that to me?

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,160
Do you think

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,800
I should escort him back?

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,120
Forget it, Sister Qiu Shui.

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
Zhao Fei Yang is a good man.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,080
If we do as he says,

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
it would be too much for us.

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm lucky.

21
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,280
You saved me.

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,600
You're right.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,840
If it wasn't for Sister Bai Jue,

24
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,280
we would have saved you.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,240
I...

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,720
Zhao Fei Yang.

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
I also sent three little beauties

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
in front of me.

29
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,960
Three great masters and one master.

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
Interesting.

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,560
Do you think

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,520
people will be safe?

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
You're the master.

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
Now you know.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
There's no chance for you to fight with the master.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
Nonsense.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm satisfied.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,080
You little beauties...

39
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
If you don't want to die, just stay away.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,760
Then you can fight slowly.

41
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm leaving.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,160
What's wrong with me?

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,600
You three fight one.

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,560
You're so fair.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm leaving.

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm a great master.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
Are you done talking?

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm done talking.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm done talking.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I'm done talking.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm done talking.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm done talking.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm done talking.

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm done talking.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I'm done talking.

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm done talking.

57
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm done talking.

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm done talking.

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm done talking.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm done talking.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm done talking.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm done talking.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm done talking.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm done talking.

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'm done talking.

66
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I'm done talking.

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm done talking.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm done talking.

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm done talking.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm done talking.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm done talking.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm done talking.

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm done talking.

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm done talking.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm done talking.

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm done talking.

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Just a two-shot.

78
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,960
Arimoto always finds merits in saving people.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
It must be good when they actually do.

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,560
No,

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
that man

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,120
is actually a dog.

83
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,380
That's unbelievable.

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
I will never ask such a useless thing.

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
It's all my fault.

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
I've made them suffer.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
You ruined my good deed.

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
You still want to run away?

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I heard that you are the first beauty of Tianxian City.

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Then, play with me.

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
How many purple flowers are there?

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,400
What is the taste of the first beauty of Tianxian City?

93
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Let me have a taste.

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You are so annoying.

95
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
What happened?

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I was shot by a palm.

97
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I...

98
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Impossible.

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Impossible.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm not a good man.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I can't get out of here.

102
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I'm dead.

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
What are you doing?

104
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
You are a bad man.

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
No.

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
No.

107
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
No.

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
No.

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I'm not a good man.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Are you okay?

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Why don't you talk?

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
You must be ill.

113
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Are you okay?

114
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I...

115
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I...

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I'm fine.

117
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
You are fine?

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm fine.

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll analyze it.

120
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm fine.

121
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I'm fine.

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm fine.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm fine.

124
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I'm fine.

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
It's okay.

127
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
It's me who is not careful.

128
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
It's okay.

129
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
It's okay.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
They have the painkillers.

131
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
It's okay.

132
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'll wake up as soon as I can.

133
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll leave the rest to you.

134
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Brother Fei Yang.

135
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You are so generous.

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Although you are not injured,

137
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
you are very patient.

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I can't be generous.

139
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Although you are not injured,

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
you are very patient.

141
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Where are we?

142
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Where are we?

143
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
I remember

144
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
we were hit by a heavy window

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
and fainted.

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
But

147
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I can't feel any pain.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
And my cultivation...

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I broke the three-digit tower.

150
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I might be a zongshi

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
I broke the three-digit tower.

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
So...

153
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,320
you could do

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
anything if you say so.

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,360
Think about it.

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
And...

157
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,900
I am tender about the Sky's cloud.

158
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I don't know

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
anything bad would happen this time.

160
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I will bacterize the MYF.

161
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I missed her.

162
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,000
when we were about to attack.

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,000
A great man appeared.

164
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,640
He saved us

165
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
by sacrificing himself.

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,320
God is so useful.

167
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
I didn't expect that

168
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
we have such a great man.

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,240
Yes.

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
He saved us.

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,600
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,680
Sister Qiu Shui.

173
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Sister Bai Zhi.

174
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,280
Although I'm the first beauty in Tianxuan City,

175
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't think you need to check it.

176
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
If you know that

177
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Zhao Fei Yao is so outstanding,

178
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,200
you must...

179
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,640
I hope you won't blame me for my death.

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,680
But...

181
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,440
what happened to our Xiu Wei?

182
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,040
And our business.

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,040
It's like nothing happened.

184
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,760
Well...

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,200
What's so funny?

186
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,120
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I'm sorry.
