1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't want to

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,800
be with you

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,000
be with you

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
I don't want to

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
be with you

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,800
I don't want to

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
be with you

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I don't want to

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Look at Feiyang

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Qingkui is reacting

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,800
I don't want to be with you

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,800
How can this be possible?

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
How come it happened?

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,400
I need to promote Qingkui

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
We need to be in a relationship

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,800
Do I like Xiaoran?

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Qingkui is at the meeting

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
We succeeded

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
But Xiaoran is against me

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
No way

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
No.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,640
I can't do this.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,760
I can't do this.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Why can't you do this?

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,040
You forgot about it in the first place.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Are you unhappy?

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
Two love each other

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
can make love last longer.

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,320
But once the person who loves each other

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
is loved by him,

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
he will be in deep love.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
If the two sides are in love,

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,480
he will die in pain.

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,160
What's wrong with you, Fei Yang?

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm fine.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
Why are you so angry?

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,240
I said, are you annoying?

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,000
You only care about helping me

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,680
and doing things for me.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
You never care about me, right?

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,880
I have the power of heaven.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,280
I don't need you

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
to be so stupid.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
Don't come to my Zhao family again.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,840
I don't want to see you again.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,480
Zhao Fei Yang.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,960
You...

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
Say it again.

50
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Say it again.

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,520
That's 100 times.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,800
You don't need to worry about me.

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,000
Because I don't need your help.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,640
Don't think too much about it.

55
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,880
You.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,360
I think we should complain.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,200
I am so scared.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Just throw a nosy disaster.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,440
I am sorry.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,800
Ahaha.

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,040
Heh.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,660
Don't.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,740
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,960
Liuiverse…

65
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,960
You can wander around this desert…

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,420
I will always remember my Entscheidung.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:23,120
Melting

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Zhang He is the top.

69
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Tang Long is the top.

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Yan Ran is the top.

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
The last match of the final.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Zhao Heng is the top.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Ge Hong.

74
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
The leader of the south county has joined the competition.

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
It should be the meaning of the four princes.

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
If you go to Zhao Feiyang,

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
you don't have to worry.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
If you meet him,

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I won't lose to him.

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Brother Wang, don't be so close to me.

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
After all, it's hard to say.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
What's the trick of this dirty woman?

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Why does Feiyang look so worried?

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Why hasn't Mr. Zhao Heng come to the stage?

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
What are you kidding me?

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
You want me to be the leader of Ge?

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Forget it.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I'll go first.

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
Okay.

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Then Ge Hong wins.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
After the final,

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
the four princes will be eliminated.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
The next day, the four princes will be eliminated.

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
The final is eight walls.

95
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
I hope the first round doesn't be too bad.

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Don't meet Ge Hong.

97
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Then,

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
there will be a new branch.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
As long as you don't meet Ge Hong,

100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
my second name will be the last one.

101
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
As the leader of Ge Hong,

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
of course,

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
you won't be the first one to be with me.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I hope I can meet Feiyang.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Then,

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I can surrender directly

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
and let him win the four walls.

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
The first match,

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Li Yanran.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
The first match,

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Li Yanran.

112
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
The second match,

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Zhang Helin.

114
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,120
It's my honor to be able to compete with Li Yanran.

115
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
The second match, Li Yanran.

117
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

118
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

121
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

128
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
The first match, Li Yanran.

131
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
The second match, Li Yanran.

132
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Are you all right?

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm good.

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
You're lucky.

135
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Thanks to your flight.

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
magical rifle.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Congratulations.

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
You joined the four walls.

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,080
You have come into hiding,

140
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,100
and now want to resort to treason.

141
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,740
You have Night Storm.

142
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
I've been waiting for you

143
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,940
for so long.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't even talk!

145
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,700
Don't count on me.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,820
I won't help you.

147
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
Zhao Feiyang.

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,540
During our an passe

149
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,700
to rush snow-ste beş Đсл

150
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,940
will fight you right until the end.

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Next, Zhao Fei Yang versus Wang Hui.

152
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
I didn't expect that

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Fei Yang would meet Wang Hui.

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,320
This is hard.

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,520
He's the former official of the Demon Lord.

156
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,520
He's a big boss.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,320
Zhao Fei Yang, you're unlucky to meet me.

158
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
But you won. You're not a genius.

159
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
Why don't you surrender?

160
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,920
Don't waste my time.

161
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm not the one who surrender.

162
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,920
Don't waste my time.

163
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm here to fight.

164
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Fei Yang,

165
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,920
today's Martial Arts Festival

166
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
will be the most popular event.

167
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,720
I'll be cheering for Wang Hui.

168
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
Yan Ran,

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,320
aren't you worried about him?

170
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,520
Don't worry.

171
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Fei Yang will win.

172
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
Yes, Master Guo will win.

173
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
What's the point of

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,720
using his humble words?

175
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Today,

176
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,120
he's the one who's going to win.

177
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Unfortunately,

178
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
he's lost his memory

179
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,920
because he didn't meet me.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
Who are you talking about?

181
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Yan Ran is so stubborn.

182
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
It seems that Zhao Fei Yang

183
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
is not the useless person in his eyes.

184
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,720
He's really strong.

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
Where's your sword?

186
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,720
It's at home.

187
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,320
Chun'er.

188
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Here it comes.

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Find a sword.

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,920
No fear, no fear.

191
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
