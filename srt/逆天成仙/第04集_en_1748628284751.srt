1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to be with you

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to be with you

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I want to be with you

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to be with you

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I want to be with you

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Miss Xianyuan is not good

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She is so annoying

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't think I am qualified

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I just want to be with you

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't be so mean

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't want to be with you

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just want to try

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Miss Xianyuan is not good

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think she can do it

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She can

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can't do it

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But she is not good at war

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think she is not good at war

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is there anyone else?

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If there is no one

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will seal the emperor

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let her win

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Master

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How long will she wait?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Maybe tomorrow

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Maybe three years

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Maybe she won't open the door for the rest of her life

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For the rest of her life?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Young master, you want to try?

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What do you want?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's boring

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It seems she can't open the door

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What do you want?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are so self-aware

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Are you talking about me?

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You are my fiancÃ©e

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You are so jealous of my husband

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Shut up

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who are you?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You don't have to be jealous

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You don't have to be jealous

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are a man of the world

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are not jealous

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Since you say so

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have to try the flower today

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You want to be a little brat

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No one will come

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Little brat

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't let the flower war go

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I am a little brat

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then everyone here

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are all little brat

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Forget it, sister

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When I was in the Zhao family

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I have seen her as a person with a sharp tongue

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think I can't stand any advantage with her

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Anyway, the bet has been made

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
After a month

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We will naturally have a relationship with you

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Already

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This young god

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The wind god is as distant as the moon

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's not normal to look at it

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This person is so strong

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't see through her cultivation

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Even if you can't see through it

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then this person

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's possible that it's Wu Pin's grand master

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Wu Pin?

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But he looks so young

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He is familiar with me

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There are guns in the wall

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It seems that I am a bad person

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I didn't expect this kind of place

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why didn't he come

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Young master

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This man has a good voice

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Little brat

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I am the fourth prince of the Empire of the Heavens

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Zhou Jie

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Come out and blow up Tianxuan City

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How disturbing

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I hope it's still cold

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Since you are the prince

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No wonder you are so young

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have this kind of cultivation

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Likewise, I am the fourth

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Two people have the same kind of illness

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Greetings, prince

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Greetings, prince

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Greetings, prince

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Who are you?

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is there any opinion on me?

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Me?

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What have I done?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's worth the words of the fourth prince

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He knows my identity

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And has the power to defeat me

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why don't you understand

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What is this idiot doing?

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He is going to punish me

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Shall we help him?

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait a minute

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are not wise enough

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't be changed

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Zhao

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Fei

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yang

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Zhao Fei

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yang

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I order you to kneel down and do your business

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then you will be punished

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And you will be forgiven

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This fourth prince

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is quite generous

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't think so

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I just think that the person who is the emperor

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
is the emperor

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He is very arrogant

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Very righteous

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I will kneel for you

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are also worthy

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What do you mean?

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Say it again

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Everyone knows that I am loyal to the Zhao family

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am very proud of my father

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I am the emperor's real son

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have the right to be the emperor

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What?

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You don't know

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or you think that you are more generous than the emperor?

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can be the emperor

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You are right

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't mean that

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have no intention

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am not a good person

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He is not only good at making excuses

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but also a good person

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If he has some more cultivation

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We three sisters

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
will be punished

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You remember

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are the one who comes back from the north

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and comes back alive

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The fifth and fourth prince

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Fourth prince is the fourth prince

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why do you have to add a son to the fifth prince?

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I hope that the fourth prince can be regrouped

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In case he comes out

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No one knows the etiquette of the emperor

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am so ashamed of you

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are so stupid

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Everyone

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I came here

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to observe the holy tree

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The fourth prince is preparing for a five-star meeting

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In the meantime

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will try to fight

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to be the crown prince

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
to be the crown prince

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Even the emperor wants to be the crown prince

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It seems that the emperor really made up his mind

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Today

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I come here

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The holy flower

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
will open for me

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It really looks like it will open

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Damn it

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am a god-given holy flower

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will fight for an outsider

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How could it be, sister Qiu Shui

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He is the crown prince

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and not an outsider

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you think of him?

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't talk nonsense

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I still have a engagement

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I will not talk nonsense

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will not talk nonsense

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How could it be?

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The fourth prince is so good at martial arts

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It seems that

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
even the fourth prince can't do it

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Since that

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Then I can't be so sad

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
in the face of the holy flower

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Elder Zhishan

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let me try again

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's not open once

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not open ten times
