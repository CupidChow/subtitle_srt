Episode 25

The Death

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,780
Here's what'sDel氛

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,020
The vectorhood of Reality

8
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,540
Back on山

9
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,460
After we get back,

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,500
before we go to the north,

11
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,620
let's get married.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,540
I'm not in a good mood with you.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,380
What did you say?

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,300
I said get married.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,100
Don't you want to have a boyfriend with me?

16
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,020
We shouldn't have a boyfriend.

17
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,940
If that's the case,

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,740
I'll be satisfied.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,460
I won't mention any external conditions.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,620
My father will agree.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,140
This guy

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,860
has read my whole body.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,460
He even said that.

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
He's just a despicable little man.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,380
You have a self-awareness.

26
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,220
I hope that

27
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
you can still come back to the marriage.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,580
Except me,

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,460
Bai Zhi, Yan Ran,

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,500
all of them are out.

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,140
Then you can just leave it alone.

32
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,180
I only said that you and you get married.

33
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,820
I didn't say that we get married to them.

34
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,660
We three have agreed to get married together.

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,580
Do you think that

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,260
you want to marry anyone?

37
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,420
Then

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,140
it's hard to say.

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,180
You're so self-aware and self-aware.

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,340
Bai Zhi,

41
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,460
don't you also want to get married with Zhao Fei Yang?

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,980
I...

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,380
What else do you want?

44
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,540
You've re-established your family.

45
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,020
And according to your cultivation,

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,180
in Tianxuan City,

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,540
the whole Tianwu Continent

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,980
will have countless young talents

49
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,820
to choose from.

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,340
Could it be that

51
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,100
you still have a lot of hope for this useless girl?

52
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,380
But I think

53
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,100
we three have to

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,020
take our own decisions.

55
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,540
I've expressed this before.

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,380
I've expressed it before.

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,620
I hope that you don't get angry.

58
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,060
I don't want to

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,660
force you to

60
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,420
think of me.

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,820
Sister Bai Zhi.

62
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,660
Do you really want to marry her?

63
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,820
I just said

64
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,100
that I want to be the master of my marriage.

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,460
I didn't say that I must marry her.

66
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,860
But

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,060
I don't want to be left and right.

68
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,100
Okay.

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,580
Sister Bai Zhi has her own way.

70
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,900
I won't say anything.

71
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,660
Yanran,

72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,020
don't you want to marry her?

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
After the competition,

74
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,300
we'll go to the wedding together.

75
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,900
We agreed to do that.

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,700
Did you really agree?

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,780
I...

78
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,540
How come I don't know

79
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,940
what happened?

80
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,860
Please.

81
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,020
What do you mean?

82
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,620
Yanran is not easy

83
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,660
to take care of Feiyang.

84
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,660
But what happened?

85
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,660
She has such a big change.

86
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,180
I can't keep doing this.

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,260
I should say it out loud.

88
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,540
I think

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,700
I've expressed my attitude to sister Bai Zhi and Qiushui.

90
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,580
My father has discussed it with Feiyang.

91
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,500
After the competition,

92
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,900
I'll marry her.

93
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,460
What?

94
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,420
What?

95
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,340
Since you said that

96
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,900
I didn't hear it clearly,

97
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,980
say it again.

98
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,300
After the competition,

99
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,540
I'll marry her.

100
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,420
If we can live together,

101
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,100
I'll marry her.

102
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,380
I won't

103
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,860
ever do that.

104
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,220
Feiyang.

105
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,940
Do you...

106
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,460
Do you...

107
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,980
want to marry me?

108
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,940
We have a engagement.

109
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,780
Of course, I...

110
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,940
You're right to answer me.

111
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,580
I...

112
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:25,300
No.

114
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,180
Protect...

115
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,900
Protect...

116
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,060
Protect...

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,260
Protect...

118
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,620
What the mosquitoes are doing?

119
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,340
Stop it!

120
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,620
Keep calm.

121
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,860
His venom

122
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,500
can kill 5 or 6 brothers!

123
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,420
Run!

124
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,340
Run!

125
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,420
Look.

126
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,260
Go.

127
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,060
Zhao Fei Yang!

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,860
I... I...

129
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,780
I have something to do at home.

130
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,620
I'll go first.

131
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,460
Zhao Fei Yang!

132
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,620
Yan Ran.

133
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,660
Why do you treat her

134
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,060
this way?

135
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,260
I've always been thinking about it.

136
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,100
I've already found it.

137
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,860
If you still treat us as sisters,

138
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,340
you should tell me.

139
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,620
What can I tell you?

140
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,820
I can only tell the truth.

141
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,100
I like her.

142
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,340
I want to marry her.

143
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,380
How is that possible?

144
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,140
How can you like her?

145
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Yan Ran.

146
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,140
Do you have any hidden reasons?

147
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,340
Or do you

148
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,820
want to say something to her?

149
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,980
Say it to her.

150
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,740
Don't be afraid.

151
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,020
Just tell me.

152
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,980
I'll take care of it.

153
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,900
Enough!

154
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,540
No matter what I say,

155
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,900
you won't believe me.

156
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,620
Zhao Fei Yang is not a useless person.

157
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,500
He's a good person.

158
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,140
You can get married or do anything.

159
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,260
It's none of my business.

160
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll even thank you.

161
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,140
If this goes on,

162
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,780
we won't be separated

163
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,940
because of a man.

164
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,100
Let the useless person

165
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,380
and the shameless person

166
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,500
let me bear it alone.

167
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,500
What did Zhao Fei Yang do?

168
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,940
He asked Yan Ran to find me.

169
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,660
This bastard.

170
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,300
I must kill him

171
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,700
to make him pay for his crime.

172
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,420
So that Yan Ran can wake up.

173
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,020
It's just a matter of money.

174
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,780
Let's go.

175
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,700
Master Xiao.

176
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,780
Where have you been these days?

177
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,220
You went to collect the herbs again?

178
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,740
You have the Chilian Fruit and the Holy Fruit Lianzi, right?

179
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,340
Yes.

180
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,780
We've collected seven herbs.

181
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,380
I've found the eighth one.

182
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,540
But I need your help this time.

183
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,420
No.

184
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,260
Stop it.

185
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,140
You did all this for me.

186
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,300
You're helping me.

187
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
I can't bear it.

188
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,620
Are you going or not?

189
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,540
Of course I am.

190
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,780
Even if it's a mountain,

191
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,620
a hot pot,

192
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
I won't believe you let me go.

193
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,180
Stop talking nonsense.

194
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,060
Before I help you,

195
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,940
I have a question for you.

196
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:07,860
I have no words.

197
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,700
Chun'er,

198
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,740
you should avoid it.

199
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,420
Yes, Master Xiao.

200
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,420
Is there anything you can't say?

201
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,820
Why do you let Chun'er leave?

202
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,740
She's still young.

203
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
Xiong Wen Zhi doesn't know.

204
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
So exciting.

205
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,060
Then, ask her.

206
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,020
Are you still a child?

207
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,900
What?

208
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,540
Ask her if she's a child.

209
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,420
Answer her.

210
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,420
You mean,

211
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,700
that child?

212
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
Not that one.

213
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,380
I...

214
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,940
I...

215
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,820
I think so.

216
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,100
What do you mean?

217
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,540
Give me a certain answer.

218
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,100
Okay.

219
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,380
I'm 100% a child.

220
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,580
Are you satisfied?

221
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,500
That's good.

222
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,340
Follow me.

223
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,060
Yes.

224
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,980
It's Qin Kui.

225
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,820
You can find it?

226
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,260
As long as you find the last ingredient

227
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
of Qin Kui Road,

228
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,420
you can make a list of nine diamonds.

229
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,180
I want to get Qin Kui Road.

230
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,020
I need...

231
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,860
Two men and women

232
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,500
to exchange for Qin Kui Road.

233
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,580
Good.

234
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,060
I'm Tong Nan.

235
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,820
You're Tong Nv.

236
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,500
You're not, right?

237
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,420
You're looking at me like that.

238
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,900
Watch your eyes.

239
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,620
You're looking at the beads.

240
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,460
Good.

241
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,700
But even if you're Tong Nan and Tong Nv,

242
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,860
it's not enough.

243
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,940
Why not?

244
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,820
Do you have any new conditions?

245
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Of course.

246
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,820
That's why we need to

247
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,140
treasure each other's love.

248
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,420
Then, Qin Kui Road can be found.

249
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
But how can we have

250
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,660
you and me?

251
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,820
Besides,

252
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,380
there's a terrible consequence.

253
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,980
What are you thinking about?

254
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,860
Why don't you talk?

255
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,180
Anyway,

256
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,180
we can't find Qin Kui Road.

257
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,420
How about we find two more people

258
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,220
to try it?

259
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
Qin Kui is a common man.

260
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,220
People can't be blocked.

261
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
People who can be blocked

262
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,660
are not Tong Nan and Tong Nv.

263
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,380
Even if they are,

264
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,740
we can't find them for the first time.

265
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,100
If Qin Kui is lost,

266
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,420
I'll be in vain.

267
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,380
We need to try it.

268
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
No need to try.

269
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,140
Trust me.

270
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,820
It's useless.

271
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,340
How can you be in vain?

272
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,060
Try it.

273
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,180
Are you stupid?

274
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,300
It's poisonous.

275
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
It'll hurt.

276
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Why?

277
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Try it again.

278
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
I said no.

279
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Come on.

280
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
Since you want to try,

281
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,460
then try it.

282
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,700
Look.

283
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,260
I told you it's useless.

284
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,100
If it's not,

285
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,460
you'll be killed.

286
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,500
Are you trying to cheat me?

287
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,940
You're not Tong Nan.

288
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,820
You're suspecting me?

289
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,900
Do you know

290
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,700
that for a man who is used to being a stranger,

291
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,300
as Tong Nan,

292
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,100
it's a very shameful thing?

293
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,740
I can't joke about it.

294
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,900
I'm joking.

295
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,500
I'm kidding.

296
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,220
I'm kidding.

297
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
I'm not joking.

298
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm not joking.

299
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
I'm not joking.

300
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
I'm not joking.

301
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220
I'm not joking.

302
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I'm not joking.

303
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm not joking.

304
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I'm not joking.

305
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,740
Why

306
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,540
did Qin Kui not respond?

307
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,060
How can I?

308
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
I'm still suspecting you.

309
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,980
How dare you say that to me?

310
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,580
Do you know what's right and wrong?

311
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,540
I didn't say that.

312
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,380
It's useless.

313
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:32,980
Let's go.

314
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,780
Let's go home.

315
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Wait.

316
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,900
Look, Ziyang.

317
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,060
Qin Kui responded.

318
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,420
How... how can it be?

319
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

320
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

321
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

322
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

323
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

324
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

325
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

326
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

327
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.

328
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm afraid I'll be able to live a life without you.
