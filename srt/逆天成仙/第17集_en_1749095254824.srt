1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
I extremely wish

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,480
For the겠 trick

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
By my grandfather

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank God

5
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not only engaged

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,760
But also all my주랑

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,160
Everything works out

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
for theFine

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm asking you.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm asking you.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,040
Zhao Fei Yang.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,240
How dare you be so disrespectful to me?

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Even if I'm disrespectful to you,

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,960
don't you know

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,400
that the family affairs of others are not allowed in the imperial court?

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,120
Or because you're the fourth prince,

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,320
you're the family affairs of others.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
You have to come here and get it done.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,680
It feels like it's a little bit of a waste.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Yes.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,680
It's just that I'm not on the side.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,160
I don't even care about the fourth prince.

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,960
The fourth prince is the heir to the emperor of the imperial court.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
He's a traitor.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,760
How dare you!

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
Lord Ge Yuzhuo.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,160
This person is so disrespectful to me.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
He's as dangerous as my royal family.

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
I order you to take it.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,760
I won't let you down.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,360
Is there a chance

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,280
to see the sixth and fifth prince?

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,720
Fei Yang is not a person who is overestimated.

34
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,240
He's so arrogant.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,320
He has his pride and foundation.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
But Xiuwei is too shameless.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,520
That's the most original difference

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,080
in the water.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,160
It's just a practice.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,200
It's a practice.

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,480
Fei Yang,

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,000
are you okay?

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,240
Since the fourth prince has ordered,

44
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,520
I'll just have to do it.

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
Is this the power of the fifth son?

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
He's so scary.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,880
The light is so dim.

48
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,600
It makes me feel like I'm in a trance.

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,960
The guy who's taking Fei Yang down

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,880
is so cruel.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,560
He's so strong.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm 26 years old.

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,200
I've already decided to run away.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know if there's a chance in my life.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,240
If he goes through this,

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,440
this is the battle

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,040
that the fourth prince has re-established.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Six bottles.

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,280
Not bad.

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,440
He's been saying that

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,560
he's a useless person

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
because he's been taking my photo.

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
Although I don't care about the success,

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,160
I've heard more about it.

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,240
Today,

66
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,600
I'll take a six-pink five-pink glass

67
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
in front of everyone.

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll clean up the rest of the glass.

69
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,880
Bai Zhi,

70
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
what are you doing?

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
12 years ago,

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,040
my father got a dragon gold.

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,920
The so-called male yurushu,

74
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
was just a bad father.

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,400
He forced my Bai family

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,280
to kill my Bai family.

77
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,240
He's a third-person.

78
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
He only took the dragon gold

79
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
and broke the six bottles.

80
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,480
He became the male yurushu.

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,720
When I saw him,

82
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,400
I wanted to suppress the hatred in my heart.

83
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
But

84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,080
I hate him so much.

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,400
How can I do that?

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
I and Bai Zhi's sister

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,400
and Fei Yang

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,040
are both in the same boat.

89
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm not looking for Fei Yang for you.

90
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,680
But I'm Bai Zhi's sister.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,160
Although I hate

92
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,160
Zhao Fei Yang,

93
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm also

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,280
a fan of Tian Xuan City.

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,240
Enough.

96
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,200
How about this?

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
You two

98
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
retreat.

99
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,720
I'll be enough for him.

100
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,320
You're against the five-pink glass?

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,720
You're not sleeping?

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm Tian Xuan City.

103
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Why is Gu Cheng here?

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Gu Cheng is the leader.

105
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
Commander Wei, Zhang He Ling is here.

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,120
Today, he's on the stage

107
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,720
to attend the Five-Pink Glasses.

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
He'll be the leader of Tian Xuan City.

109
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,920
Who dares to act?

110
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,440
No one can stop him.

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Yes.

112
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Do you want to rebel?

113
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
These fools.

114
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,320
I just want to

115
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,840
suppress your hatred for Zhao Fei Yang.

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,800
I wonder

117
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,000
how you guys are so close.

118
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,040
Your Highness.

119
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
This hat

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,480
is too high up in front of you.

121
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,600
Is it the emperor of the Heavenly Kingdom

122
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
who is so arrogant?

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,760
Are you going to shout

124
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
the people of Tian Xuan City?

125
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,000
You're right.

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,040
The city leader is right.

127
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Zhao Fei Yang is the one in Tian Xuan City.

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,240
He's a bit arrogant.

129
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,760
But he's the criminal

130
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,640
who said we're from Tian Xuan City.

131
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,520
We can't keep this up.

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,240
You guys.

133
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,120
You guys.

134
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
You're a bunch of ants.

135
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,880
You're just a bunch of ants.

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,080
Your Highness.

137
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,520
If you need it,

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
I can kill them all.

139
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
If we kill them in Tian Xuan City,

140
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
they'll be in trouble.

141
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm afraid they'll be in danger.

142
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,080
But if we don't do it,

143
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
this evil spirit will be in trouble.

144
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,600
Ke Hong.

145
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,440
You're so arrogant.

146
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,640
What?

147
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,920
Do you think

148
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,880
if we become the capital of the south,

149
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,600
we can be invincible?

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Yes.

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,240
It's true that we're from Tian Xuan City.

152
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,240
How could we?

153
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,440
Old things.

154
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
You're going to pay for it.

155
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,640
If you think it through,

156
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,440
I'm the leader of the Heavenly Kingdom.

157
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll help the four princes.

158
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
If you all get out of here,

159
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
I'll take Zhao Feiyang

160
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
and that woman.

161
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,040
If you still don't get it,

162
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,000
don't blame me for being ruthless.

163
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,720
You...

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
If you want to fight,

165
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,880
how can you be less than me?

166
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Mr. Xiao.

167
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
Where have you been lately?

168
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,120
It's not for you.

169
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
What?

170
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,760
Xiao Ran?

171
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,680
You're the first one in Tian Xuan City.

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Xiao Ran.

173
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
Ke Hong.

174
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,760
How dare you be so single-minded?

175
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,800
You're just a mere piece of crap.

176
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,200
You really want to challenge me?

177
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,480
Do you know

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
the difference between a piece of crap and a piece of crap?

179
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
The words have been released.

180
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,360
Do you think I'm just pretending to be a gun?

181
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,080
Although Xiao Ran is just a piece of crap,

182
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,160
he's just a very sharp sword.

183
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,840
If he fights,

184
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
I might not be able to easily defeat him.

185
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Mr. Xiao.

186
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,760
What do you think you should do?

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
These people are so stubborn.

188
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Forget it.

189
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,080
When the five-star fight is over,

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll take over the battle in Meijiang.

191
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,640
I'll have a thousand ways to kill him.

192
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Okay.

193
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
Don't get me wrong.

194
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm just a bit of a personal grudge

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
with Zhao Feiyang.

196
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,880
I don't need to face this.

197
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm also willing to

198
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
give you my word.

199
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
I'll take over the battle at any time.

200
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,040
You...

201
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,760
Sister Bai Zhi.

202
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
You're so strong.

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,760
You can't just stand on your courage.

204
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,280
I just saw the hope.

205
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Calm down.

206
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Why?

207
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,200
Why can't I do anything?

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,400
Am I...

209
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
Am I that weak?

210
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Wait.

211
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,840
Did I let you go?

212
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Zhao Feiyang.

213
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,760
Don't be too much.

214
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,080
Can I help you?

215
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,960
What?

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
I killed him for you.

217
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,480
What did you say?

218
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
Your Bai family and my Zhao family

219
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,320
are like family.

220
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been here.

221
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Since you're my wife,

222
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
I can't leave you

223
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,600
with your family.

224
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
So I killed him for you today.

225
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,200
It's a good idea.

226
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,200
What do you think?

227
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,040
Are you serious?

228
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,360
Of course.

229
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll kill him.

230
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
This is it.

231
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,960
Be careful, Mr. Ge.

232
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,640
Be careful.

233
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,840
This is it.

234
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,480
This is it.

235
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Don't be ridiculous.

236
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Don't be ridiculous.

237
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Don't be ridiculous.

238
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
You're so stupid.

239
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,000
You're so stupid.

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,080
You'll be in the official meeting in three days.

241
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,040
You should go back to practice.

242
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,200
Why did you hit me?

243
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,960
I don't want to face you.

244
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm not pregnant.

245
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,040
I can't kill Ge Hong and泡牛 for you.

246
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,880
I'll tell you when I recover.

247
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I didn't say I'd let you kill me.

248
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Xiao Ran.

249
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
You really make me

250
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
touched and touched.

251
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,320
Right.

252
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,240
It's important to have a big meeting in three days.

253
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,440
It's better not to get into a conflict.

254
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Right.

255
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm here to hold a big meeting in three days.

256
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,040
I can fulfill it.

257
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm here to help my team

258
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,760
to choose some excellent generals.

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,560
You've been making trouble.

260
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,600
No one has ever done it.

261
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,400
No one has ever done it.

262
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,920
Zhao Feiyang, you're so careless.

263
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,480
If you get into a conflict today,

264
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,720
you'll win.

265
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,920
How can you take the fight?

266
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
How can you take the fight?

267
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
The Empire of the Heavenly Sky is under my command.

268
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,840
How can I resist it?

269
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,240
You're the one who offended the Fourth Prince.

270
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,840
Don't push us into the fire pit.

271
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
You're still thinking about the identity of this prince?

272
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,120
You want to go out for a fight

273
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,720
for your own sake?

274
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,560
You want to go to the battlefield

275
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,920
to sacrifice your life

276
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,680
for the Empire of the Heavenly Sky?

277
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
But when will the people of the royal family

278
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,720
put you in the camp?

279
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,880
You can live your life out.

280
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
But you still want to get away from the rules.

281
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm telling you,

282
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
people don't have the dignity of a person.

283
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,880
They're dead.

284
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,080
They have no dignity.

285
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Zhao Feiyang,

286
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,040
what's the point of saying that?

287
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,320
The dignity is the power.

288
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Without the real power,

289
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,640
these are the bad and the conscious.

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,760
So,

291
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,840
you don't deserve to say that.

292
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,160
I don't deserve it.

293
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't need you to be a good person.

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,160
I don't need you.

295
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,720
You!

296
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,080
You?

297
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,080
You're here to protect me.

298
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,240
I've been in the battlefield

299
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
for a long time.

300
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,080
I've been dead.

301
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,200
So, I think that

302
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
the dignity of a person

303
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,760
is more important than anything.

304
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,080
So, I won't

305
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,680
look at anyone's dignity

306
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,880
because I'm not

307
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,400
the one you're in the position of the crown prince.

308
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,680
I won't follow anyone's idea.

309
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,040
The world is so big.

310
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,560
There are hundreds of millions of reds.

311
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,480
People are different.

312
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
Me?

313
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
It's me.

314
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,280
It's a different color.

315
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,840
Flower.

316
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,480
Me.

317
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,320
Chun'er.

318
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,440
Young Master.

319
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,160
Let's go.

320
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,040
Go.

321
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,320
The wind blows.

322
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,280
The rain falls.

323
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,400
