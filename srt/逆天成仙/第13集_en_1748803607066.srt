00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The wind blows through the window, the moon shines through the window

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The constant wave makesصe이라는

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
First, the slees fall, the ship hoppy

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,940
Ab hine, the边热, branh ngo

11
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
Worts your eagerness andرة

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,140
You sound like your absolute strength

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,940
My breathing's not bad

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,040
My feet ache as the ship vessel rots

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Passed away

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,040
How could I let my tears go

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,040
for me?

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Little ears?

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Two little kids?

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Why are they so familiar with the picture?

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Little Yun Duo, look.

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Little Yun Duo's picture is so cute.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,040
This is my special gift.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Why did Xia Zimu do what I used to do?

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Is it...

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm afraid if I think about it,

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,040
I'll be ashamed.

28
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Second Young Master,

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
you're a good person.

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm not afraid of being a bad person.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm afraid that if I think about it,

32
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I'll be ashamed.

33
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
But I'm too stupid.

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't understand what you mean.

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
You mean

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
this little boy is me

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
and this little girl?

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I know.

39
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
It must be you who used to sleep with Tianxin.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
That's right.

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
This little girl

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
is you.

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Me?

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Second Young Master, you're joking.

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I've never left Xilin.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,040
How could I be this little girl?

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
I don't know where you grew up.

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
But I'm sure

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll be a special person like you.

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
I must have escaped from the palace

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,040
when I was a child.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Don't worry.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,040
I didn't cut your hair in the hall before.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
I won't do it again.

55
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Second Young Master,

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
why did you do that?

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Because I know

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
you're that little girl.

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
So please believe me.

60
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Second Young Master,

61
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
to be honest,

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
I didn't mean to

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
bring Princess to the Prince's Mansion.

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
It's all a misunderstanding.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm so jealous of you.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm so jealous of you.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm so jealous of you.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
But fortunately,

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I've met a noble person.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
I can make mistakes all the time.

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I know

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
you don't want to be Princess Jin.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
But don't worry.

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,040
You won't make mistakes.

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Get out of here?

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Fine.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Second Young Master,

79
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
since we're family,

80
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
let's see something.

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Why don't you go back first?

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I'll be back soon.

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Okay.

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Second Young Master,

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
this is the gold box.

86
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
It's very important to me.

87
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
I must open it.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
I wonder if you can open

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
the cloud pattern on it.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
The cloud pattern on it

91
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
seems complicated.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll help you figure it out.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Thank you, Second Young Master.

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Princess Jin,

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Princess Jin,

96
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
you're looking for her?

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Kill her.

98
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Don't worry.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Leave her to me.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
You've healed the Princess's leg.

101
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Someone still needs to get rid of you.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
In the future,

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
you won't be in danger.

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Trust me.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Today,

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
I think it's a good idea.

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I'll have more people to see.

108
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
It's better to leave her.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Princess Jin,

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
I have something to ask you.

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm a little tired.

112
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

113
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
You said it's important.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
You must keep it in mind.

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
The cloud pattern is also complicated.

116
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I really should leave her now.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Fine.

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Go back and tell the Prince.

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I'll be there in time.

120
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay.

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Your Highness.

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
Your Highness,

123
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm sorry for coming late.

124
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
It's okay.

125
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Sit down.

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Your Highness!

127
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
If you argue with me!

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
But I came to inform you.

129
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Because if you finish it, it's over.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
My leg is always pretend.

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I've been pretending for more than ten years.

133
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
That's because the things in the palace are too complicated.

134
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I can only use this method to self-suffer.

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Sorry.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
I hope you won't get angry.

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
In order to avoid the trouble,

138
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
His Highness chose to hide the truth.

139
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Now he's standing up for me.

140
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
How could I get angry?

141
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Thank you.

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
This is a sign of time.

144
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Actually...

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
I have something to tell you.

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Have you ever said anything?

147
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I've been pretending for more than ten years.

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Please allow me to leave

149
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,040
the promise of the wedding.

150
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
We're not married.

151
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
But now we can only do what we want.

152
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,040
I'll find a way to make you leave the future.

153
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Leave?

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
What do you mean?

155
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
We're not married.

156
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
That's good.

157
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I just hope that I can leave.

158
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Okay.

159
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
You said you wanted to leave.

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
I want to ask where you're going.

161
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
You're so bold.

162
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
You're not going out?

163
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
You're the only one here.

164
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,040
The King of the country asked me to ask you about the night's auspicious time.

165
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Now that the auspicious time has passed,

166
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,040
I'll go to the King of the country and ask for an excuse to leave.

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
No.

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Your Highness.

169
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
I don't agree.

170
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,040
I've made my decision.

171
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Please allow me to return to the King.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
You want to leave with no decision?

173
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Your Highness's burden is at stake.

174
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
You're afraid before you leave.

175
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I have a way to all her problems.

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
You stay here and wait for the birthday party.

177
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
After the birthday party is over,

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I will tell my father about this.

179
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Your Highness.

180
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
It's a deal.

181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm done.

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
What?

183
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
He wants to meet my father.

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,040
It seems that he is too eager to do it.

185
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
No.

186
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I think the situation between the prince and the princess

187
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
doesn't mean that the prince and the princess are going to leave.

188
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,040
It's too sudden that the bad luck comes.

189
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Maybe I was wrong.

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
He really doesn't like it.

191
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
No way.

192
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You like him too.

193
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Why are you so harsh?

194
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
I like him too.

195
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I understand.

196
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
We agreed before.

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
You are honest with the prince.

198
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
It's good that you are not only honest with him,

199
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
but also reasonable.

200
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
You are really good at doing things.

201
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Beitao.

202
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Do you know that everything is in love?

203
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
You know that you have a fake identity and that you are dangerous.

204
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I don't believe it.

205
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
If I don't leave,

206
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
he will hurt people and people.

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,040
I like someone who likes him.

208
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,040
He can't be dangerous and let him wake up.

209
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
What if he wants to wake up with you?

210
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
But I don't want to.

211
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
He is the prince of Lu Zhao.

212
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,040
He is noble and respected.

213
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
He is a great man.

214
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
He can't be like me.

215
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
It's a big trouble.

216
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
But...

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Why?

218
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
He can't be with someone he likes.

219
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
My lord.

220
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I have a little guess.

221
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Tell me.

222
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Do you think that

223
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
he will bring trouble to you

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
with his identity in the mansion?

225
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
What if he does?

226
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I have stood up for him.

227
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I will protect him.

228
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Or...

229
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,040
he thinks that I can't protect him.

230
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,040
I will prove it to him.

231
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
How?

232
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
According to what the prince said,

233
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I will leave soon.

234
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
You mean...

235
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
The birthday...

236
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
The birthday...

237
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,040
What gift should I give to the emperor?

238
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
The birthday...

239
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
My lady.

240
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,040
You don't need to prepare such a serious gift.

241
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
The gifts you prepared in the past years,

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,040
the emperor doesn't like them either.

243
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Will you talk?

244
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Will you?

245
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
I know my mistake.

246
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
I am a smart man.

247
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
I have a stupid man like you.

248
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,040
I don't know how you can live in this palace.

249
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
My lady.

250
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
How about we discuss it with the second prince?

251
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I want to see him.

252
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
I don't know what he is busy with.

253
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I heard that

254
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
since the prince stood up,

255
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,040
he went to the prince's mansion to eat the sweet soup.

256
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
He never came out of the mansion after a few times.

257
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
It must be because of the prince.

258
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
But I heard that

259
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
it was the prince who went to find him.

260
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
That's because the demon girl

261
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
seduced our Yun'er first.

262
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
She cured prince's leg first.

263
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Now she took the responsibility

264
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
of my host country army.

265
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
You send someone to tell the prince.

266
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Tell him to prepare the bullet for the army.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Don't run around.

268
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I will handle the rest.

269
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Yes, my lady.

270
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Your highness.

271
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
What's wrong?

272
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Noble Consort sent a message.

273
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
The army is under attack.

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
You must know the plan

275
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
between the prince and the princess.

276
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
I see.

277
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Noble Consort.

278
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Have you prepared

279
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
everything you prepared?

280
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Your highness.

281
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
The gifts you sent to the army are...

282
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm not talking about that.

283
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm talking about the Yun'er's mechanism.

284
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
I found some clues.

285
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
According to your description,

286
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
it must be the Yun'er's lock of Xiling.

287
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
What about the way to open the Yun'er's lock?

288
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I haven't found it yet.

289
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
It was built tens of years ago.

290
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It's used as a royal palace.

291
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
It's too complicated to make a palace.

292
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
It's been lost for decades.

293
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
It's very similar to the Yun'er's lock.

294
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
You go and check it out.

295
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes.

296
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
You should at least eat something.

297
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,040
You still have something to do today.

298
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,040
You still have something to discuss with the second prince.

299
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
It's okay.

300
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
The second prince is the one.

301
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
What about the prince?

302
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
I'm here today too.

303
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Have a bite.

304
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Yutong.

305
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I'm full. Let's go.

306
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Princess Consort.

307
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I have to discuss something important today.

308
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
I'm very tired.

309
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
You should eat more.

310
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Your highness, I'm full.

311
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I'll go now.

312
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Greetings, Princess Consort.

313
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Brother.

314
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
I just finished breakfast.

315
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I'll be waiting for you.

316
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
You're really a good friend.

317
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Let's discuss about the birthday party

318
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
with me and Princess Consort.

319
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Okay.

320
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Princess Consort.

321
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Let's go.

322
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Your highness.

323
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Let's go this way.

324
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Let's go.

325
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Then we'll change it to a place to enjoy the night.

326
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
It's a gift from Ying Lan.

327
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
It's not enough for half an hour.

328
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
What do you think, your highness?

329
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
That's right.

330
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
It's not enough for half an hour.

331
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Look.

332
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Can this be changed?

333
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Let me see.

334
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
How about this?

335
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
You've adjusted the Qingzhong duck.

336
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Yes.

337
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Because I think

338
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
we've already had the duck.

339
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
There will be some extra fish and bugs.

340
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
So I think we should change it.

341
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
What do you think?

342
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
No.

343
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
They are small dishes.

344
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
They are crab sticks.

345
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
They taste different.

346
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Keep it here.

347
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Do you need any help?

348
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Miss Wang.

349
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,040
What is the meat of the Eight-Six-Mu?

350
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
I don't know.

351
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I don't know.

352
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
This is the famous dish.

353
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,040
It's made of wood ear, chicken eggs, cucumber, and so on.

354
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Then do you like this dish?

355
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
I think you love it so much.

356
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Such a strong dish.

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
He must like it.

358
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,040
Let's add it.

359
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Okay.

360
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
We need a soup now.

361
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Soup?

362
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Fish and seafood soup?

363
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Yes.

364
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
How about

365
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Qingliang San Si Soup?

366
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
Qingliang San Si Soup?

367
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
This is good.

368
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Although Miss Wang doesn't know how to behave this time,

369
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,040
she is quite cute.

370
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Today's business is almost here.

371
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
You must be tired, right?

372
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Let's go back to the room.

373
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
I haven't finished writing.

374
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Let's go.

375
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Let me go.

376
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Let me go.

377
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
What are you doing?

378
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
What am I doing?

379
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
What did you do just now?

380
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
What did I do?

381
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
You don't know what you did?

382
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
You look like a princess.

383
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Didn't you always look like this?

384
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
That means I'm not good enough for you.

385
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
You look so embarrassed.

386
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
Your Highness, you think I'm embarrassed, right?

387
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
It's okay.

388
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
I'll wait for a few more days.

389
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
When my father is over the burden,

390
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
no one will come to you anymore.

391
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
I didn't mean that.

392
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Your Highness.

393
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Your Highness.

394
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
How is it?

395
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Yutong told me that

396
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
the Princess Consort has already used the sand.

397
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
Now she is going to prepare the burden.

398
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Is she still angry?

399
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
I didn't ask her out.

400
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Then why did you go there so long?

401
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm not angry anymore.

402
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I'm just worried about you.

403
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
I'm not angry anymore.

404
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I'm just worried about you.

405
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm just worried about you.

406
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I'm just worried about you.

407
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm just worried about you.

408
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I'm just worried about you.

409
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Your Highness, I think

410
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
it's unnecessary.

411
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Princess Consort must be angry.

412
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
You said too much today.

413
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
But I'm wrong.

414
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Your Highness.

415
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
According to my experience,

416
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,040
there's no right or wrong in love.

417
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Moreover,

418
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Princess Consort and Second Prince

419
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,040
are in a relationship.

420
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Why are you in such a hurry today?

421
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Princess Consort and Second Prince

422
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
are in a relationship.

423
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I should have been more strict with my life.

424
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,040
But Your Highness,

425
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
you pushed Princess Consort to Second Prince.

426
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Do I need your reminder?

427
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
I don't know what I did.

428
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm also very regretful.

429
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,040
But I really have no courage to say it.

430
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
Your Highness.

431
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
You can't drag me out.

432
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,040
You should explain to her before the show ends.

433
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
If you drag me out again,

434
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
you'll lose her.

435
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Explain to her?

436
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Explain to her?

437
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Can you keep her?

438
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
You have to keep her.

439
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Let me think about it.

440
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Tomorrow, you'll see Noble Consort.

441
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Noble Consort is always in trouble.

442
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
I'll keep her safe tomorrow.

443
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
What do you think?

444
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Your Highness,

445
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
are you asking about my opinion?

446
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm just a few words.

447
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm a person.

448
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Forget it.

449
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
I'm not asking.

450
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm not concerned about my own problems.

451
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
I have a good understanding.

452
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Your Highness.

453
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Your Highness.

454
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Your Highness.

455
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Why are you here?

456
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,040
I was seriously injured yesterday.

457
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
It's okay.

458
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
You've been saying it very late.

459
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
I really don't have the proper condition.

460
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
I've apologized to you.

461
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm sorry.

462
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
I've apologized to you.

463
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Don't be angry.

464
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm not angry.

465
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
We'll meet Noble Consort later.

466
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
It's not good to be late.

467
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Let's go now.

468
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,040
She didn't put it in her heart.

469
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
She doesn't care about me at all.

470
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,040
I'm very proud of her.

471
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
But she didn't do that before.

472
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
You're indeed as good as before.

473
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
You're early.

474
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,040
You're also as good as before.

475
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
You're right.

476
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
We're here.

477
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

478
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

479
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
The birthday cake of the State Army is good.

480
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm really grateful.

481
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
You're right.

482
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Your Highness.

483
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
This is a series of light cakes

484
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
that I've been making for the whole night.

485
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Please have a look.

486
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Princess Jin.

487
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
The State Army's birthday cake is

488
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,040
a celebration of the Army.

489
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,040
But you have a long list of cakes.

490
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
If you're tired of

491
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
making a mess of the State Army,

492
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
what should you do?

493
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,040
And you have

494
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,040
three thousand coins.

495
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
The State Army has always been

496
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
so generous.

497
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
Your Highness.

498
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
Let me have a look.

499
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,040
The sand is slow and cheap.

500
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,040
It's cheap.

501
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
It's good for dancing.

502
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
It's good for breathing.

503
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,040
It's good for playing the role of a play.

504
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
It's not suitable for

505
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
the State Army.

506
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Your Highness.

507
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
I think it's good.

508
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
What did Prince Jin say?

509
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,040
I think it's good.

510
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
First of all,

511
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Your Highness,

512
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
the guests have been so busy this year.

513
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
There are at least a few guests this time.

514
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,040
The Prince of Qi is indeed a good-looking man.

515
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
But the birthday banquet is different from the night.

516
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,040
So he has a good performance three thousand times.

517
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,040
As for the sand,

518
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
the stage and the dance you mentioned at the end,

519
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
I think

520
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
if Noble Consort and Princess

521
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
understand each other like Princess,

522
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
they should be more capable of winning the heart.

523
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
You...

524
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,040
I think you don't have to rush to make a comeback.

525
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
I have her arrangement.

526
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Your Highness.

527
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
This is the birthday cake of my first time

528
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
to be compared with my father.

529
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Of course, it will be a little bit uncomfortable.

530
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,040
I know your point of view.

531
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
After I go back today,

532
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I will take part in your arrangement

533
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
and make plans.

534
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Take part in my arrangement?

535
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
That's not good.

536
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
The state army will give you the birthday cake

537
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
to the Prince of Jin's Mansion.

538
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
It's to surprise you.

539
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
If it's the same as the previous year,

540
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
wouldn't it be...

541
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
to offend the state army?

542
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Mother,

543
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,040
actually, you just passed the birthday cake.

544
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I have all the reference.

545
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Really?

546
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
If so,

547
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
then there are some arrangements

548
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
that are still very reasonable.

549
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
For example,

550
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
the birthday cake is very cheap.

551
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
It's very cheap.

552
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,040
It's very good for dancing.

553
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,040
The stage is very...

554
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Very wonderful.

555
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Yes, wonderful.

556
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
It's very good for singing.

557
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Of course, it's wonderful.

558
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
It's still my idea.

559
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Mother,

560
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
actually,

561
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,040
all these are all from the Prince of Jin.

562
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
It's not important.

563
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
But this birthday cake

564
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
must be in the year of the monkey.

565
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Princess Consort Jin,

566
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
I'll give you seven days.

567
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
After seven days,

568
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
you must give me

569
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
a real surprise.

570
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Mother,

571
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
I don't have much time for seven days.

572
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Princess Consort Jin,

573
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
you think so?

574
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
Your Highness,

575
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
do your best.

576
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
Okay.

577
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Then I'll be your wife

578
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
on the seventh day.

579
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
If you need anything,

580
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
just come to me.

581
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Okay. Thank you.

582
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Sir.

583
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Sir.

584
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Sir.

585
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Sir.

586
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Sir.

587
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,040
You can't eat it.

588
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
You're poisoned.

589
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Don't eat it.

590
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Princess Consort.

591
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Princess Consort.

592
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Princess Consort.

593
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Princess Consort.

594
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Princess Consort.

595
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
You hate me that much?

596
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,260
You are getting too angry, Your Highness.

597
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,480
I will talk to you later.

598
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,280
Mr. Wong, you're already here.

599
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,560
At the eventual ceremony,

600
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,900
the matchmaker will arrive.

601
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,640
However, we're no matchmakers.

602
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,400
We are商先生s.

603
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800
I'm afraid to end my life

604
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,200
and will never be happy again.

605
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,600
How innocent

606
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,500
and tender

607
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,340
you are.

608
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,460
Don't forget

609
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,900
our love.

610
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,700
Of course.

611
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,880
Lord.

612
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,200
Will you ask me

613
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,040
Do you know

614
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,320
that cats can't eat the falling grass?

615
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,560
I know.

616
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,680
Cats eat the falling grass and get poisoned.

617
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,440
But I didn't stop them

618
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,240
when I saw them eating it.

619
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,880
Why?

620
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,160
I let them eat it

621
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,560
when they like it.

622
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
If they get poisoned,

623
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,880
I'll cure them all.

624
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,600
Who would let them like it?

625
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,840
Your Highness,

626
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,120
you mean you and Princess Consort?

627
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,640
You like her so much.

628
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,160
It's easy to cure them.

629
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,000
We have two pills.

630
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
Tell her

631
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,400
you know her real identity.

632
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,440
Then you

633
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,200
use the pills together

634
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,360
to cure them.

635
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,640
But the falling grass can't move.

636
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,840
If it can,

637
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,480
it'll be more and more poisonous

638
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,840
if it's a cat.

639
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,400
It only wants to hide away from me.

640
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,960
I think you're a little too much today.

641
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,160
Even I can tell

642
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,560
I like you.

643
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,680
You know it, right?

644
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,040
You like her,

645
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,320
she likes you, too.

646
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Tell her your real identity.

647
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,760
What are you thinking?

648
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,760
You're talking nonsense.

649
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,800
What are you thinking about?

650
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
I just want her to divorce me.

651
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
No matter what happens to me,

652
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,600
she won't be implicated.

653
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,560
But you really like her.

654
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,760
That's why I want to stay away from her.

655
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,360
Your Highness,

656
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,320
you abducted me on your own.

657
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,760
Did Yunwen has any orders?

658
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,400
Not yet.

659
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,600
I wanted to ask you

660
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,360
what happened to you

661
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,720
last time I nutrients you.

662
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,960
I have already told Yes.

663
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,440
Good.

664
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,240
That's too good.

665
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,560
When are you going to leave?

666
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
My daughter is pregnant.

667
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,800
We'll see.

668
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
I'll leave after the king and I have the agreement

669
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
with the king's birthday party.

670
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Okay.

671
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Don't worry.

672
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I'll arrange everything after you leave.

673
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
No need.

674
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
I can take care of myself.

675
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
We don't need to be so polite.

676
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Second Prince.

677
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
You're a good friend of mine.

678
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
And you're a good friend of Yunwen.

679
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
I've no objection.

680
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Then our agreement is not a deal.

681
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
But we have no objection.

682
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Tang Ruo.

683
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm serious.

684
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Let's go to the higher mountains

685
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
and the farthest places.

686
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
I'll take you as a serious joke.

687
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
I have to go now.

688
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Your Highness.

689
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
The goods of the army are all prepared.

690
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
You've got everything prepared.

691
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
This time, I'll make sure

692
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,800
the king doesn't pay.

693
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Who told you to come?

694
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
What?

695
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Your Highness.

696
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
You can't let the woman go.

697
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,800
If you lose this chance,

698
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm afraid you'll have a lot of trouble in the future.

699
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
After the war,

700
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
she'll leave the Prince of Jing.

701
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I don't need this chance in the future.

702
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I don't want to have anything.

703
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I'll go to the higher mountains

704
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
and take her as my friend.

705
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Your Highness.

706
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Yes.

707
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Your Highness.

708
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
I have something private to discuss with you.

709
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I'll go to talk to Second Prince.

710
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
I...

711
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
You can go to whoever you want.

712
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
It's okay for us to go soon.

713
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Your Highness.

714
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
No.

715
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Your Highness.

716
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
It's different from what we said.

717
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
We didn't explain it clearly tonight.

718
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Forget it.

719
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
We can't keep the money.

720
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,800
If she's not willing to pay, I'll go.

721
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Your Highness.

722
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
You're trying to get the money for Yiven.

723
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Yiven is money.

724
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I don't like to be a little girl.

725
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

726
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

727
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

728
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

729
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

730
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

731
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

732
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

733
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

734
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

735
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

736
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

737
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

738
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

739
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

740
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

741
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

742
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

743
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

744
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

745
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

746
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

747
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

748
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

749
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

750
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

751
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

752
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

753
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I'll go to the higher mountains.

754
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,800
I'll fulfill the mission to find out your love.

755
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,800
They have already abandoned you and have fled to your home.

756
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,460
I wonder how they would dream of defending a small, gentle,

757
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,760
interactions with Reportants.

758
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,260
Because you're selfish.

759
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,460
If there' s no new time,

760
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,100
let's go back to the old time.

761
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,700
I can also make up for my regrets

762
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,940
I can forget how far away you are

763
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,060
I can't see how dangerous it is

764
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,100
If I still look for the world

765
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,420
I won't be separated from the love

766
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,380
I will eventually say

767
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,060
Don't forget

768
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:20,780
The love they gave me

769
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,700
Never
