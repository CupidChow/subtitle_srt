1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't want to be with you

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't want to be with you

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who dares to break the promise

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
After the rain and the wind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wind and the wind are silent

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't want to be with you

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't want to be with you

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What's going on?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was sent to the capital by the imperial guards

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's going on?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was sent to the capital by the imperial guards

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What a shame

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
My jingyu, my jingyu

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Shoufeiyang

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sister Bai Zhi

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sister Yainan

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Long time no see

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Long time no see, sister Qiong Shui

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sister Yainan, who are you looking for?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I...

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm looking for Feiyang

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Zhao Feiyang?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He finally got married

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Zhao's family is now left alone

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How dare he go to the front line?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He's not afraid of death

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Even if his father is in danger, he won't let him go

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I think he will come

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Then you must be wrong

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why do you think Yainan is so cruel?

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He cares about Zhao Feiyang

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is it my fault?

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is sister Qiong Shui waiting for me?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yainan is waiting for Zhao Feiyang

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Zhao Feiyang?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is he doing here?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Greetings, Your Highness

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Greetings, Your Highness

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Everyone

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is the Five Directions of Tianxuan City

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I, the emperor of the imperial family, have already known

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that the vice-chairman ordered me

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and the chief of the imperial family to come to the front line

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will think about it

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and make a comparison

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, Your Highness

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't expect that the fourth prince of the royal family

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
would come back so soon

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And he's afraid that the emperor will be in danger

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It seems that Zhao Feiyang's worry is still happening

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Zhao Feiyang is not coming?

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When the meeting is over

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I will personally give you a chance to

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
report to the chief of the imperial family

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wait a minute

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You have fallen down

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Young master, there are many people today

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is it not?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why are you looking at me?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Have you reported to me?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Zhao Feiyang

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Highness

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't be so surprised

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I didn't expect that you are here

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where? Where?

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your Highness

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
will appear

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to be the one who has been under my control

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and has been under my control

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Does the fourth prince

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
have a grudge with Zhao Feiyang?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Look

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I just said

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
he will come

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and talk to me

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sister Lianran

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How do you feel that you know him very well?

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I...

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I guessed it

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Chief Ge

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
According to you

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
how many times has Zhao Feiyang been under my control?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not a single day

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He has no control

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not even a dancer

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But the strange thing is

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
how he defeated me last time

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Didn't he participate in the Northern River Demon

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and survive?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Maybe he has a chance

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and maybe he is pregnant

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Moreover

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sister Jing may not be

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
the one who has all the strength

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
According to you

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you also think that he is a skilled person

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In front of absolute strength

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
all the small moves

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
are all from the heart

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You are right

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
With your martial arts skills

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and the skills of the six-spin martial arts

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
this girl

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is not a skilled person

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The martial arts meeting

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
will begin soon

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This time

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we will take the ranking order

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and use the self-reliance

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to record the score

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The previous four people

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
can choose to compete

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and directly attack the eighth wall

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In the process of choosing

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we will decide the four positions

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and the final ranking

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Until then

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't kill each other

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Finally

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I wish you all a happy youth

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
Don't you have to be difficult to mine

125
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,640
Li Yanran

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
Father

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,920
The anticipation of the talent will first

128
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
So beautiful

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,080
Big Feng Hua is no different like his

130
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,760
He was born to be the portrayal şimdi

131
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,160
If we have a lover

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
I guess I will be able to크를

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
dream

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Li Yanran

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
The career is 21 years

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,980
Very rewarding to us,

137
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,520
so great!

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,620
Don't you think they have grown so pretty?

139
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,960
They even have more intenages.

140
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,680
the level 10 thou itself?

141
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,580
My significant help.

142
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,900
name a union with練

143
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:10,580
new quite

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,000
the eunuchs who measured the mileage or capacity and efforts

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
in the metropolis,

146
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,920
were failed.

147
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,320
Qian Di wouldn't be the winner.

148
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,240
You wish.

149
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,960
Awesome.

150
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,220
Good.

151
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,460
It seems that you will have the chance

152
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,780
to achieve so many things.

153
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,760
Yao.

154
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,680
My lord.

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,380
Miss Bai, you look so weak.

156
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,740
I heard it incinerated all over the country.

157
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,220
Are you Harvard's provisional assistant?

158
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,300
How can you be Tin?

159
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,160
The truth is absolutely unknown.

160
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,620
It's too trivial.

161
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,500
Tianxuan City's Bratsu you call Art of War.

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,160
After long ocupation of three action offices,

163
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:17,400
they would observe the overlook Parliament ми's

164
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,260

165
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,600
flang

166
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,200
QUhou

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,980
There are 25 refugee entrails here.

168
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,220
25 refugee entrails?

169
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,060
It was really my name,

170
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,300
blossoms blooming!

171
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,980
Come on,

00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,880
here is a03 patrol carry.

173
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,060
Not all!

174
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
How?

175
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,740
Didn't expect Qiu Shui can be this strong!

176
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,980
She's quite young.

177
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,740
They are all acclaimed by the East.

178
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,600
It's true.

179
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,780
We two have it at home,

180
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,900
and we have it in our hearts.

181
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm a bit jealous

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,680
of your acting skill!

183
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,120
To Mukbang En Mirepov!

184
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,220
I have won innovative damage.

185
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,980
I knew when I was fighting him temporary,

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,520
I could not give him birthday energy.

187
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,760
Thank you for์

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,260
and if not,

189
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,640
I will not go to death.

190
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:43,920
This fight is

191
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,020
Isn't��

192
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,820
He's here again this year to be the first one.

193
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,940
Let's go.

194
