1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
Salt Flavor

2
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,020
Major General

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,740
Liu Sergio

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,280
uler, let's have aema

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Wait, wait, wait.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,440
Young Master is still fine.

7
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,520
We all,

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
including myself,

9
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
have tried and failed.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,400
He

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,360
has this need.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,480
What?

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
You've tried it.

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,120
Can't I try it?

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Only Childe Zhao

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,600
can try it today.

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,320
I heard what you said.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,160
Why don't you just give up

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,560
so that you can be disappointed?

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,880
He's so stingy.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,920
Even Elder Zhichan recommended him.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,680
He's still not dead.

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
I think he was

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,720
stimulated by Sister Qiu Shui.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
But he's right.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,080
It's nothing.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Fine.

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,040
I'll see

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,800
what he can do.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Elder Zhichan

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,560
has always been a good man.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
He's been admired.

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
Why did you say something

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,400
today?

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,360
Have you forgotten your loyalty?

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
I didn't hear it wrong.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
He

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
dares to say Elder Zhichan.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,560
I thought I was

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,960
coming back from the battle in the north.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
I thought I was a hero.

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,040
What a tone!

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
The Fourth Prince was punished first.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,240
Now,

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,920
even Elder Zhichan is in trouble.

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
He's really a good man.

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,200
He's never let anyone

49
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,640
take the opportunity.

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,080
I think

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
he's not a good man

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,800
and he's cute.

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,840
But if I say it,

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,000
he'll think I'm sick.

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Good job.

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
Good job.

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,760
I've been waiting for you.

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm sorry, Childe Zhao.

59
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,880
Please.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,240
Thank you, Childe Zhao.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,680
I can Frankfurt

62
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,520
you stronger.

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,160
Young Master, fighting.

64
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
If I can't try it,

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,520
it'd be hilarious.

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,160
At that time, my face will get fat.

67
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't waste your time.

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,360
If you try it, you'll fail.

69
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,560
You are right.

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,180
ティナ

71
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,200
Don't waste the time.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,680
Careful.

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
We lost very soon.

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,240
Remove your clothes.

75
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,240
faire tre's look.

76
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
What if we fail?

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,440
It's opening!

78
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,160
What is it?

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm so opening!

80
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm so opening!

81
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:04,880
Like this!

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
derivatives!

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,280
wards!

84
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,520
The diamond!

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
The Aliens are open!

86
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,080
Really open!

87
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
How is that possible?

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
He's not even pushing anymore.

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
How is it possible?

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Wow, you're so cool!

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
What's going on?

92
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
So many people didn't even open the door.

93
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Why?

94
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
It's open.

95
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Maybe our people's young and young people

96
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
are still in the middle of the year.

97
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
And Prince Zhou

98
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
has just launched a few cities in the Holy Fruit.

99
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
He's making a big mess.

100
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

101
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
You're the one who will open the Holy Flower for you.

102
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
In the future, you'll be a shining one.

103
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
You'll have a bright future.

104
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Elder, you've been too much.

105
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You're just lucky.

106
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm not lucky to say that

107
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
the Holy Flower is ready to be destroyed.

108
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Even if you're not strong enough,

109
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
you'll just be a great leader.

110
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Elder Zhishan,

111
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
it's not fair.

112
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
He didn't even use his spiritual power.

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
He's taking advantage of us.

114
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Your Highness, you think so?

115
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
I think so too.

116
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't deserve it.

117
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I don't deserve it either.

118
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I don't deserve it either.

119
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I don't deserve it either.

120
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't deserve it either.

121
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Everyone,

122
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
the Holy Flower is related to spiritual energy.

123
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
And it's the Holy Flower of Heavenly Xuan City.

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
It's so beautiful.

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Don't you think it's a shame?

126
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Damn it.

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Forget it, Sister Qiu Shui.

128
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I just suffered a big trouble.

129
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Maybe it's because I've been in the cell to face him.

130
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes.

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It's a good thing for him.

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Young Master Zhao, please go to the lotus seed.

133
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Elder Zhishan has been protecting the Bodhi tree for many years.

134
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
He takes care of it every night.

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
You deserve it.

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Otherwise, thank you, Young Master Zhao.

137
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Zhun'er, take it.

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
If you don't follow me today,

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
we won't be able to get this good thing.

140
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Just give it to me.

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Such a precious thing.

142
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I can't believe it.

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
It's a gift from a maid.

144
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
It's quite generous.

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
The Holy Flower is so beautiful.

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
But I dare not.

147
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
It's too precious.

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
How about giving it to Young Master Zhao?

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I don't like his stuff.

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I do like it.

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
But I'm afraid he won't give it to me.

152
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
It's fine.

153
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
But he has three people.

154
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I only gave you one.

155
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
How do I get this?

156
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I like Sister Bai Zhi.

157
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll give it to her.

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Okay.

159
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
I'll listen to you.

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
It's so precious.

161
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Just give it to me.

162
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Since I insist on giving it to you,

163
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
take it.

164
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Thank you, Young Master Zhao.

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Thank you, Zhun'er.

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
You're welcome.

167
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
We'll be a family in the future.

168
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Here you are.

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Thank you.

170
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Thank you.

171
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Thank you.

172
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Thank you.

173
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Even if I have to give it to Young Master Zhao,

174
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I can't give it to you.

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
I...

176
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
What kind of fate is this?

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Sister Bai Zhi.

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Congratulations on getting the Holy Fruit.

179
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Yes.

180
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
You really love me.

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Sisters,

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
I'd like to share the Holy Fruit

183
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
with you two.

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Forget it.

185
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Since it's for you,

186
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
just keep it.

187
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Don't fall.

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Young Master,

189
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
after you get the Holy Fruit,

190
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
will you become

191
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
super, super, super awesome?

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I don't know.

193
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
But I'm sure

194
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
you'll be super, super, super envious.

195
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm so happy, Young Master.

196
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Zhun'er,

197
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
you go home first.

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll be right back.

199
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
What for?

200
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
There are so many problems

201
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
with the little girl.

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I want to take care of her.

203
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Hurry up.

204
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Hurry up.

205
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Can you?

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Hurry up.

207
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Hurry up.

208
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Come out.

209
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
You're not tall,

210
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
but you're not weak.

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
You're very kind.

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
You're asking your little girl

213
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
to run away first.

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
You're really a good person.

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm a good person.

216
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Then you must be a bad person.

217
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
If you say so,

218
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I won't object.

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm a little

220
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
reluctant to kill you.

221
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
How about this?

222
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Don't fight.

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I'll let you

224
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
die a little bit more easily.

225
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
If you want to kill me,

226
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
do you have a reason?

227
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I have a reason.

228
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I'll let you do it.

229
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
As long as you die,

230
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
your foreign brother

231
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
will be able to go to the throne.

232
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Zhao Heng.

233
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
You know the reason.

234
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Now,

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
you can safely go to the throne.

236
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
After the attack,

237
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
it's a pity.

238
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
It's a pity that he has a few matches.

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I can't take it anymore.

240
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
The sun rises with you.

241
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
The blood is still dry.

242
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
The wind blows away the rain.

243
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
The wind blows away the rain.

244
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
The dream is on the road.

245
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
There is no fear and no fear.

246
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
The dream is on the road.

247
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
The hero is here.

248
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
The storm is coming.

249
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
The road is not easy.

250
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
The fire is deep.

251
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
The fire is not strong.

252
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
The sky is changing.

253
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
The smile is flying.

254
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
The wind blows away the rain.

255
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
How to agree?
