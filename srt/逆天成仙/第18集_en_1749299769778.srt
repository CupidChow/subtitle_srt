1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
How.

2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
An validate in Tianshuan City

3
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,840
actually deserves another honor.

4
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,280
I think,

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,000
you can help me

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
achieve my computer ważity.

7
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,340
I impression of the болיז people.

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
But I know a way.

9
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,240
What means?

10
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,540
Let's go fighting

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
after participating in the election three days later.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm going to have another look in the company

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
I'll kill you.

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,360
The five temples

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,120
are all young people under the age of 28.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,280
Lord Ge Yu, you...

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,920
It's the case.

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,720
But there's no rule.

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
You can't participate

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
when you're old.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,720
That's good.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Since Lord Ge Yu is willing to marry you,

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
I'll teach them

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,040
a lesson on the stage.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
It's okay.

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,920
Since I'm here,

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,720
I'll have fun with them.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,920
Where have you been these days?

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,480
Is it because of last time?

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,400
Do you think I'm a coward

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,040
who's like you?

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
No.

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,000
What's wrong?

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm a minor.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
A minor? I can't see.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Let me see.

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,680
The gold vein is damaged.

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
It's a minor.

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
How did you get it?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
You don't want to say it?

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,240
This is the lotus seed.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,720
It's a good thing for your wound.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,520
You can take it.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
The lotus seed

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
helps you improve your cultivation.

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
You can keep it.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
Why?

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll let you take it.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
This guy

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,840
is still concerned about the new person.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,120
How about this?

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,720
You come to the training room today.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll help you heal.

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,640
You know this?

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,760
Do as you please.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
The lotus seed.

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,760
How is it?

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
It's basic.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
And it's good for your cultivation.

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,880
I felt that

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,920
the gold vein was damaged

62
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,800
by a huge amount of power.

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,760
And it's not spiritual power.

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,400
How did you do it?

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
I told him that

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
I was too harsh

67
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,360
to make him feel it.

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
When I was fighting in the north,

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,280
I learned a little bit of martial arts.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,880
It's the fifth round of the Martial Arts Conference in the third round.

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I didn't do it.

72
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,560
What did you do?

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,720
Gold vein.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
Gu Mian tabs,

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,080
Wan Hua oämän...

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
And

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,160
Dan Hu

78
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,880
covered 33 times in the same day.

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,760
He really is it.

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,960
I thought it was the maxeng that I've built to speaker you.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,080
But there is no limit to theelect Потому.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
It can only Margaret 4.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Sorry.

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,520
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
Are you stupid?

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
You've done so much for me.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
Why did you say sorry to me?

88
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
As a master,

89
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
I should be able to protect myself.

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,800
Who is your disciple?

91
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,880
Besides,

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,240
even if I'm your disciple,

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,400
you shouldn't do this.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
You know who you don't owe.

95
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
I care about

96
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
many people in this life.

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
You're one of them.

98
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
Your three brothers

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
took my hand

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
to fight for the country.

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
It's my regret.

102
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
I'm just

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,880
making up for my mistake.

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,600
So,

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,120
you don't have to be so burdened.

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
How could you not be?

107
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
I said I don't need to.

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,800
You were just

109
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
treating me with wounds and fruits.

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,480
We're even now.

111
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,160
Nonsense.

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,280
You were hurt because of me.

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,560
How could you treat me with wounds?

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
I don't like to be treated with wounds.

115
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,000
How about this?

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
What's your dream?

117
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll find you a promise.

118
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,160
You...

119
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
You'll make me a promise?

120
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes.

121
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,320
I, Zhao Feiyang,

122
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,480
will make a promise.

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
As long as I can do what I can,

124
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,680
I'll do it for you.

125
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,000
Be serious, okay?

126
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm the first time

127
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
to make someone promise so seriously.

128
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,800
You...

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Be serious?

130
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Hit me.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
No wonder you

132
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
didn't want to be my disciple.

133
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,880
Are you going to hit me?

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
Do you like

135
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
someone older than you?

136
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,160
I...

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
What...

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
What do you mean?

139
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,840
You...

140
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
You're still too young.

141
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,400
Don't be so easy

142
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
to make a promise.

143
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I'll take it as

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,640
you didn't hear what you said.

145
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,200
Don't put it in your heart.

146
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,080
I, Zhao Feiyang,

147
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,440
am a man and a husband.

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,640
I can't take back

149
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,920
what I said.

150
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,920
Fine.

151
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll keep the promise you made.

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,640
Okay?

153
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:15,880
No.

154
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay.

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Stop talking nonsense.

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
You'd better listen to me.

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It's more important than anything.

158
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Fine.

159
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,680
Although the gold bones

160
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
have been cut off,

161
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,320
it's not easy to

162
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
repair them in time.

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm in a good condition.

164
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,200
I'll keep working

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
to recover my condition as soon as possible.

166
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,760
Mother.

167
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
Where are we going?

168
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,520
Mother.

169
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,440
Why did you stop me from practicing?

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,520
You need to practice

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
to recover your condition.

172
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,480
You're so fast.

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
You're so weak.

174
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,600
You're

175
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,000
meaningless.

176
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,080
I didn't know

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
that.

178
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,680
Let's go home early.

179
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,560
What's wrong?

180
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Nothing.

181
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,000
Maybe the strength of the practice

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,680
caused some damage.

183
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Look.

184
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
I said

185
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
why is a little girl

186
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
so strong?

187
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,080
Now,

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
she's so weak.

189
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
How can you

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,680
recover her condition in three days?

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,600
I'm too anxious.

192
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
There's a coin-sitter

193
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,000
in front of us.

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,200
If you soak it in,

195
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
it'll be a miracle

196
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
to recover your condition.

197
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,400
With this kind of magic?

198
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Of course.

199
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Like back then,

200
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
my mother and your father

201
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
would soak in

202
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,920
the coin-sitter.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Why are you laughing?

204
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,400
Your father and I

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
would only

206
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
heal wounds.

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,480
But...

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,880
I didn't say anything.

209
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,600
Fine.

210
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
Give it to me.

211
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Go.

212
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,600
Go.

213
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Mother.

214
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
Why don't you soak it in?

215
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I didn't get hurt.

216
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
Why should I do that?

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,040
Listen.

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
When you get in,

219
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
take off your clothes

220
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
and put the cold-hearted one

221
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,720
in the golden valley.

222
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,320
That way,

223
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,440
you'll have a miracle.

224
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
You want to take off your clothes?

225
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
Well,

226
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,080
you and your father...

227
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
Again?

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,320
You're not talking.

229
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
No one will take you as a duck.

230
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
Fine. Go.

231
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,920
Go.

232
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
I know, Mother.

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Wait for me here, Mother.

234
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,680
What's up?

235
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,720
Come out.

236
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,560
Mother!

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,680
It's okay.

238
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,800
Hold on a second.

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
We're almost there.

240
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,760
Coming right back.

241
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,320
You,

242
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,280
come out.

243
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,920
You could go home.

244
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,960
Good.

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,160
Where are you going?

246
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,920
Give me your Water Goer.

247
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
I'll get your Badger.

248
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,800
I've got an idea!

249
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,560
Let's ask Mother

250
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,600
to go home!

251
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,920
What's going on?

252
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,400
I'll go find the flying duck.

253
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
When did you come?

254
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Don't get excited.

255
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Listen to me.

256
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
I came first,

257
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
then you came later.

258
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
You came first?

259
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Then why didn't you get hurt when I came?

260
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
I was scared just now.

261
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,400
I didn't dare to get hurt.

262
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,680
Why did you get scared?

263
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,600
Look.

264
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,880
Did you see anything?

265
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,640
I...

266
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
You hit me!

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,520
I saw...

268
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,000
I didn't see anything.

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
I was a little scared.

270
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
I was scared.

271
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,400
I was scared.

272
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
Just a little bit.

273
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,840
I killed you!

274
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
Wait!

275
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
I killed you.

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
You can't touch my heart!

277
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
If you dare to move,

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll fight you.

279
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,720
You dare to...

280
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
I dare to...

281
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Then you don't know!

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,160
Right?

283
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,760
Calm down.

284
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
I didn't mean it.

285
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,760
You said you didn't mean it.

286
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,960
You just got out of the water.

287
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Now...

288
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,640
Can you do this?

289
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
You just came here so straight.

290
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,120
If I get out of the water,

291
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I'll...

292
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm not more embarrassed.

293
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,280
I thought you were just a little person

294
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
who's just a little bit of a whore.

295
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
Now it seems

296
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
you're still a wretched and despicable person.

297
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,680
Before I killed you,

298
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,360
get out of here!

299
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
Wretched?

300
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,880
You said it like I did it on purpose.

301
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,800
Can you stop

302
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,320
and get out of here?

303
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
I don't have any punishment.

304
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,040
Get out!

305
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,360
Fine, fine, I'll get out.

306
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,120
What are you doing?

307
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't move!

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm not a animal.

309
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,280
How can I get out?

310
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,960
You...

311
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,440
Anyway, don't move!

312
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,720
Fine, then you cover your eyes.

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,960
I'll get out.

314
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
No!

315
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,760
What if you do something weird

316
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,200
when I close my eyes?

317
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
What weird action can I do?

318
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,240
Can you stop

319
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
and get out of here?

320
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,000
How about this?

321
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,120
I'll cover my eyes.

322
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,840
You go.

323
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,960
Don't think!

324
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
Then...

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
let's soak together.

326
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,040
I...

327
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,560
I'm almost done.

328
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,160
I...

329
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm going home.

330
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,920
You can't leave.

331
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,440
Please,

332
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,120
you should leave now.

333
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,280
Can you?

334
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,920
I'll watch you...

335
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,800
You...

336
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,520
I...

337
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,080
I...

338
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
Don't cry.

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,160
I'm sorry.

340
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
You're so stubborn.

341
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
You're crying in front of me.

342
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm not used to it.

343
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
I hate you.

344
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm just...

345
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,080
How can I be so shameless

346
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,440
and despicable to you?

347
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,480
Why are you

348
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,760
making such a bad name for me?

349
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
In a bad name,

350
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
I can't express your dignity.

351
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,920
My dignity?

352
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,480
I...

353
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,560
What are you doing?

354
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
There's a secret forum

355
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,040
and a clear water.

356
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm going to

357
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,320
turn 70.

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,000
I won't.

359
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,760
But it's good.

360
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,400
But they're so rebellious.

361
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,080
Look at the yellow-tailed wild boar.

362
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,600
There's a wild beast.

363
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,680
What are you afraid of?

364
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,640
I have a piece of medicine for the Grand Hall.

365
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,200
I'll cover the whole sky.

366
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
I have several opponents.

367
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,680
But they're still worried.

368
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,880
They'll run away

369
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,000
if they see me.

370
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,920
There's no one here.

371
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,440
I'm about to go to the battlefield.

372
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,200
You can't be satisfied.

373
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,000
If I die in Beijing,

374
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
it's a pity.

375
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
If you die,

376
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,880
you can't be...

377
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
You can't be...

378
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,200
dead.

379
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,840
Okay.

380
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
I won't say anything.

381
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,160
Then you can leave.

382
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
You can't be satisfied.

383
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,960
You can't be satisfied.

384
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,360
I'm still here.

385
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
You don't look good in your show.

386
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
You've been running around

387
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080

is dirty.

You'd better

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,520
get your belly hurt

401
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,800
if you know that I'm the third one.

402
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,240
I won't spare you.

403
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,920
