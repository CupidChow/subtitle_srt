1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
shortly asleep

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Theしか dusty

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:57,880
sometimes

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,000
Mom computer

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
I gave her the lotus seed.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,080
Do you think it's my business?

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,920
But you already gave it out.

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,800
I thought you regretted it.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
You wanted to take it back.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought you were a smart man.

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,080
But you escaped from the last time

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,600
and let the big thing forget.

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,760
Is there a reason to give it back?

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,360
I just don't want to see you waste

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,120
such a good thing for this house.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,360
What house?

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
Do you know?

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
This old house is a big deal

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,000
for Miss Bai.

20
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Yes.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,680
My grandfather, grandma, and parents

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
were living in this house

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,240
when they were little.

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,400
This house is really a big deal for me.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
So no matter what,

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,440
I want to take it back.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,440
Even if you're being held up,

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
you're being held up.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Mr. Zhao,

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,520
you should pay attention to what you say.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,880
Miss Bai and I

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,640
are not related to you.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Why are you talking?

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,560
You have a wide range of stores.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I have a engagement with her.

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
She's my fiancée.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,560
You can tell me if she's interested.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Fine.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,160
But

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I'm the one who sells the goods.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,960
Miss Bai,

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,160
have you bought it?

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
If you don't, I'll leave.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
I'll buy it.

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,360
Then bring the snacks and lotus seeds

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
over here.

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,160
I'll give you the house.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,560
This...

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Miss Bai,

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Miss Bai,

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,560
your grandma and parents

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,760
were living here.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,960
It's a big deal for you.

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,760
But they're not here anymore.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
Why are you still living here?

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
At least

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
I can find a way to get my memories back.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,160
Memories are all about

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,760
the family in the crowd.

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
There's no place for family.

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
It's just a normal house.

62
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,960
You spend the money on the house,

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
but you buy a memory that you can't see.

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Do you really think it's meaningful?

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,560
You're right.

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,960
But I still want to buy it.

67
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,560
This person is in the pit.

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
I'll buy it.

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Then buy it.

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,360
But at least 300 taels.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
It's the limit of the house.

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,360
We don't want more than one.

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,960
What 300 is the limit?

74
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
I'm telling you,

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
the house is in my hand.

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I said how much money I'll sell.

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Then sell it slowly.

78
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
Do you think besides Miss Bai,

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
who else will buy

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
a 13-pointed

81
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
chest house?

82
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,160
Yes.

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
Besides me, I'll buy this house.

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,160
No one else

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
wants to buy this house.

86
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Forget it.

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,160
I don't want this place to be sad.

88
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
You made a wise decision.

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
Take your 500 taels,

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
and listen to the other parts of the world.

91
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Just pick whatever you want.

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,960
And it's all in the bag.

93
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
You'll have to pretend to be good

94
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
when you come back.

95
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
You'll have to spend a lot of money.

96
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's go.

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,360
No, no, no.

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
No, no, no.

99
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,360
Miss Bai,

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
didn't you say you'd buy it?

101
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
You came here today,

102
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
so I brought the house.

103
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,360
But it was 500 taels before.

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
You broke the contract,

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
so I don't want it.

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,160
You can keep it.

107
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,960
Good.

108
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,360
I'll sell it to you now.

109
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,560
500 taels.

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Right?

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
250 taels.

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,960
250 taels?

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
You said you'd buy 300 taels just now.

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
It's more than 250 taels.

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
That's 200.

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,160
No, no, no.

117
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
250 is 250.

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Mr. Zhao,

119
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
there's really no space left.

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
I've been with you

121
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,560
for years.

122
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,560
You...

123
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Stop looking at me.

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
I can't stand this.

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
Then,

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,760
you'll have to look at Miss Bai.

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Deal.

128
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Thank you for helping me today.

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,760
Otherwise,

130
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll be beaten up.

131
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
You're not going to say anything to me.

132
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Mr. Zhao,

133
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I think

134
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
you misunderstood.

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,360
I'm thinking the same thing as you.

136
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,960
I'm sure our marriage

137
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,760
won't be so easy.

138
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll agree.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,760
I really appreciate you today.

140
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
But

141
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,760
I won't be so careless.

142
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
I think Miss Bai misunderstood.

143
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,360
I'm just a stranger.

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
I don't mean anything else.

145
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,160
Since Miss Bai is so thoughtful,

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll tell you.

147
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Did I misunderstand her?

148
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Did I...

149
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
take the burden of being a man?

150
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Zhao Feiyang,

151
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
what kind of person are you?

152
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
Father,

153
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
Mother,

154
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Grandpa,

155
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Grandma,

156
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,560
I took the ancestral house back today.

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,760
It's the first step.

158
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
Next,

159
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
Ge Hong,

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I'll kill him myself.

161
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
For my Bai family,

162
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,760
I'll be a man

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
who will protect me.

164
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm not in a good condition.

165
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm really in a bad condition.

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
But if I can make a change of my spirit,

167
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,360
I'll be in a good condition.

168
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,760
It's said that

169
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,560
there are more than 33 levels of fire in the Sky Hall.

170
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,360
This is the first step of practicing the Nine Flames Spirit Pill.

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
I have to find a way to get the fire.

172
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,760
I'll make the plan.

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,960
I didn't expect that you'd be in the bamboo forest

174
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,960
and you'd be the one who saved me.

175
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
I'm sorry for the water.

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
You're welcome.

177
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
We're all from the Sky Hall.

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,360
I can't save you if you're in trouble.

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
By the way, Brother Wang,

180
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,560
you saved me that day.

181
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Why did you leave without telling me?

182
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
You've been looking for me for a long time.

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,760
You've been caring about saving the life.

184
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
I had something important to do that day.

185
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,760
I saw you left without telling me.

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
I was keeping an eye on you.

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
I came out to look for you.

188
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,760
I see.

189
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,760
It's all because of Zhao Fei Yang.

190
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,160
He left someone who shouldn't be.

191
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
We saved him.

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
He turned around to escape.

193
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,360
If Brother Wang didn't save him,

194
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,760
the consequences would be terrible.

195
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
Zhao Fei Yang is a useless person.

196
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,560
He only thinks about escaping on the battlefield.

197
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
What else can he do?

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
That's right.

199
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
I hate him.

200
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm not like him.

201
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,760
He's in a marriage agreement.

202
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,960
You and his marriage agreement are wrong.

203
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,360
You can find a reason to leave.

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
If he doesn't want to,

205
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
I'll ask for a reason for you.

206
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Sister Qiu Shui,

207
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,360
you're the Tianxuan City's Tianzhi School's leader.

208
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,560
How can you be convinced by such a person?

209
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Forget it.

210
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,560
This is my personal matter.

211
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
I won't let Brother Wang interfere.

212
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,360
Zhao Fei Yang?

213
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,160
Chen Qiu Shui?

214
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
And this person...

215
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Mr. Zhao,

216
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,960
you're really not good at this.

217
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm the leader of the three brothers,

218
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Wang Hui.

219
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
To be honest,

220
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,160
you're my subordinate, Xiao Jiang.

221
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
So you're Wang Xian Feng.

222
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,560
Shi Jiang.

223
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,560
Your three brothers are all

224
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,960
the heroes of the world.

225
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Their death

226
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,360
is a great opportunity for our army to fight for power.

227
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,960
But,

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
it's too bad.

229
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,560
If you want to die,

230
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,960
you can't keep your love.

231
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,360
Otherwise, you won't die.

232
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
You're the one who asked them to die.

233
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
The battlefield is full of twists and turns.

234
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
No one can meet the enemy.

235
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,360
They'll be so angry.

236
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You're blaming me?

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm just a soldier.

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
How dare I?

239
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,360
Xian Feng.

240
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Zhao Fei Yang.

241
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,360
The battlefield is full of twists and turns.

242
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
As the general,

243
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,960
you should consider it as a big game.

244
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Don't be too cautious.

245
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Sister Qiu Shui is a good person.

246
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,760
I'll definitely

247
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
fight for the general again.

248
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,160
By then, I'll make a revenge against the demons.

249
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
Let them see

250
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,360
how I can be a real man.

251
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I'll try to be a general

252
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,360
and fight with you.

253
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Okay.

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
With Sister Qiu Shui's talent,

255
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
it'll be a great reward for Xian Feng.

256
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,560
I hope so.

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
What's the matter with you two?

258
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm going to the Sky Tower.

259
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,360
You're the one who broke into the Sky Tower?

260
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Do you want to die?

261
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
You can't fight

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,160
just because you're the monster of the previous three levels.

263
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
The Sky Tower is indeed a great practice.

264
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,160
But just because of your skill.

265
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
Then you two shouldn't be so worried.

266
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,760
I'll go first.

267
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,560
You two,

268
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,560
come to the other side later.

269
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,560
Wait.

270
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
What's wrong again?

271
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
If you weren't

272
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
on the side of the Zhao family,

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
I'd be so embarrassed to care about your life.

274
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,160
If you want to continue training,

275
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,960
you can fight with me and the Wang team.

276
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
The resources you get

277
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
can be divided into two.

278
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Sister Qiu Shui.

279
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,760
How many times have you been in the Sky Tower?

280
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,360
19 times.

281
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm 21 levels.

282
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,760
I can take you directly

283
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
into the room from the level 21.

284
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
But the level 21 is very dangerous.

285
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
If you want to take her with you,

286
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,160
Zhao Fei Yang,

287
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,960
why don't you just go through the level one?

288
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
Although the level one is not a good thing,

289
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
it's not as bad as losing your life.

290
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Well...

291
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,160
That's right.

292
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
I forgot.

293
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,760
I don't have the record of the Sky Tower.

294
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
If I go now,

295
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,160
I have to fight level by level.

296
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
When can I reach the level 33?

297
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
It's clear to the team.

298
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,960
Yes.

299
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,960
It's the team.

300
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,760
Let's go to the level 21.

301
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
The sky is cold.

302
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm a little drunk.

303
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm going to the top of the moon.

304
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
Who's the face with a gentle smile?

305
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
My tears are full.

306
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,160
How can I not be happy?

307
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,360
How can I be happy?

308
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Who's the face with a gentle smile?

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,960
The wind blows through the sky.

310
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,360
Who's the result?

311
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,760
The wind blows through the sky.

312
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Who's the face with a gentle smile?

313
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,760
My tears are full.

314
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,560
How can I not be happy?

315
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,760
How can I be happy?

316
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,960
Who's the face with a gentle smile?

317
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,360
The wind blows through the sky.

318
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,760
Who's the result?

319
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,360
Who's the face with a gentle smile?

320
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
The wind blows through the sky.

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Who's the face with a gentle smile?
