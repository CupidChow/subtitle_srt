1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't want to be alone

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The hot summer night

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who dares to break the wind

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The wind blows

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The wind blows

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The wind blows the wind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The wind blows the wind

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's so funny?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
After the high man defeated the chief

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He also passed his spiritual power to you

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
To heal your wounds

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Maybe it was just a moment of healing

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There is still a part of spiritual power left in your body

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So your cultivation now

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is it necessary to improve?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this class

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Can you say it?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yiran sister

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Have you ever asked the name of the high man?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where is the god?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Xiao Ke

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I...

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was too excited at that time

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I forgot

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You forgot?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then do you remember

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The appearance of the high man?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
High man

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
High man with a mask

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then I have no idea

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How do you think

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yiran sister is hiding something?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you doing?

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sorry, sister

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Today

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I pulled you over

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a disaster

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't blame yourself

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If there is no such thing

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We won't have this kind of opportunity

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Just blame it

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
As long as Feiyang is that bastard

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not as good as a pig dog

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He is willing to save him

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He actually escaped from the demon

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Damn it

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Next time I will teach him a lesson

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
At the beginning

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We were going to let him run away

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Forget it

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Anyway, we are fine now

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a good thing

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Although it is

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But he really doesn't deserve a man

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This kind of person

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yiran sister

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You haven't seen him yet?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I admit

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
At the beginning

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I am proud of him

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But today's play

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let me completely disappointed him

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
From today on

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am not so sure about Zhao's family

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
About Zhao Feiyang

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How did Zhao Feiyang do this?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I hate him

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I hate him

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Enough

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't mention that useless man

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The engagement is over

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We saved him today

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So we don't owe them anything

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From now on

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We three sisters

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We will be together

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We will be together

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We will be together

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sooner or later

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We will be on the top of the heaven and earth

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We will meet the old man

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
who will save us

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Where is Fifth Brother?

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why are you still

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course I am not dead

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's the matter?

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's going on here?

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Heng'er

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There is a reason

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fifth Brother's attitude today

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is much better than before

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think he is a good man

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is a good man

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He is a good man

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He is much better than before

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He knows that he is called Fourth Brother

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He is the fifth brother

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I hope he won't be guilty

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Feiyang

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are a brother

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You are so lonely

106
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wan Sha

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You and your fifth brother

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
will have a meal together

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We will drink together

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and save you

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Good

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You haven't been with Fifth Brother for more than a year

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You should save him

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
By the way

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I heard that Fifth Brother

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
will come to our Zhao family for the Grand Master

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's bring him here together

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want to take him back

119
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's call the Grand Master together

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will call him here

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Look at Heng'er

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He is 17 years old

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He is alone on the road

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He is young

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He has a friend from Grand Master

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He is not limited

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You should learn from him

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I learn from him?

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did you make a mistake?

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I am good

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why should I learn from him?

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are good

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are good

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can the three girls in Chen Bai

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
come to our house

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
to get married?

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They don't know me enough

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If they know me enough

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they will marry me

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They will marry you

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't say that it's three girls

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There is one

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
who can see you

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
with your eyes

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You will be happy

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then you should wait

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
for the smile

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You little brat

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why are you so angry?

154
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Did Hongbin

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
come to the Zhouzhi Palace with Zhao Daibu?

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I just met

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
a person who makes me feel bad

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Your Highness, it's serious

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Tianxuan City

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is not good for you

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not a living hell

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Zhao Feiyang

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Zhao Feiyang?

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Who doesn't know Zhao Feiyang?

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He is the first talent in Tianxuan City

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How could you be

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
so angry with such a useless thing?

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's really useless

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I still don't know

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if I can

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
fix it

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The demon clan in the north

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Zhao family and three children

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
took the war to the north

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But only this one

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is alive and dead

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Do you think

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have a reason

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to suspect you?

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I suspect you

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
colluding with the demon clan

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
or selling the treasure

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to make it alive

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Otherwise, how can you

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
come back alive?

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Your Highness

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is this crime

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
a little too big?

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it?

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why didn't Zhao Qin

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
close his son?

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He is so loud

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a big crime

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In our country

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Li Lai is a person of the spirit

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He is a person of the spirit

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He is a person of the spirit

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He is a person of the spirit

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Zhao Feiyang is a person of the spirit

202
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They have to

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
take care of the Zhao family

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your Highness

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You don't mind, do you?

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How dare you!

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are a Tianxuan City's

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
city leader

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How dare you question me?

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't dare

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You are so naive

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You asked me to come to Tianxuan City

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to build the demon army

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You used to be a Tianxuan City's

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
important person

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You are so useless

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You are so useless

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How can I

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
lead the demon army in the future?

220
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Highness

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are right

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will use the Zhao family

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Master Li

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You just need to cooperate with me

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Your Highness

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Listen to me

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Although Zhao Feiyang

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is a person of the spirit

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But the Zhao family is full of Chinese

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If we are forced to do this

232
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I am afraid we will be in danger

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you afraid?

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are right

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are afraid that he will rebel

236
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Master Li

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You just need to cooperate with me

239
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to build the demon army

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
After we are in the north and west

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you will be the leader

242
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
At that time

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I will help you

244
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You will be the leader

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
of the 16 cities in the south of the country

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Master Li

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is this true?

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Of course

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It depends on your performance

250
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Thank you, Your Highness

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you, Your Highness

252
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where did he go?

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He let you kill that bastard

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He is back

255
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Where is he?

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Who can tell me

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
what happened?

258
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I am afraid that he will rebel

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Master Li

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You just need to cooperate with me

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Your Highness

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Listen to me

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You just need to cooperate with me

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Highness

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Listen to me

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You just need to cooperate with me

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You are afraid that he will rebel

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Master Li

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You just need to cooperate with me

272
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your Highness

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Listen to me

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You just need to cooperate with me

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are afraid that he will rebel

276
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes

277
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Master Li

278
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Master Li

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Master Li
