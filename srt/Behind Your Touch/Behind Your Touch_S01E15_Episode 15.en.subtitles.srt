1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,509
It was Seon-woo.

3
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,764
Dr. Bong!

4
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,720
What's going on?

5
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,142
Seon-woo!

6
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,856
Run!

7
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,316
Seon-woo!

8
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,442
Run! Hurry!

9
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,123
Please help me.

10
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,916
The serial killer is here.

11
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,450
The only person I trust…

12
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,285
No.

13
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,079
The only person
who trusts me right now is you.

14
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,826
Seon-woo.

15
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,412
Seon-woo!

16
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,830
Seon-woo!

17
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,791
Seon-woo!

18
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,918
No!

19
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,671
Seon-woo!

20
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,047
No!

21
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,468
Seon-woo!

22
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,387
Seon-woo!

23
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,682
No!

24
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,684
Seon-woo!

25
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,975
Ms. Bong.

26
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,854
I hear you were with the victim.

27
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,691
Did you happen to see the killer's face?

28
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,031
Do you remember anything in particular?

29
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,832
You can't pass.

30
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,791
Move!

31
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,880
Wait.

32
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,220
Bong Ye-bun,

33
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,763
are you all right?

34
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,059
Are you satisfied now?

35
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,812
What are you going to do now?

36
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,231
Seon-woo's dead.

37
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,775
What are you going to do?

38
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,703
Can we talk at the station?

39
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,290
Give her some time.

40
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,459
Ms. Bong.

41
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,893
Was Kim Seon-woo really murdered?

42
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,937
That's what Detective Moon said!

43
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,356
The Major Crimes Division
won't be okay with us doing this.

44
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,942
I'm going to catch this bastard
no matter what.

45
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,237
Look for any evidence
before the Major Crimes Division arrives.

46
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,363
Yes, sir.

47
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,744
What the…

48
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,997
Hey, what happened?

49
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,498
Wake up!

50
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,293
-Sit him up.
-Yes, sir.

51
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,673
What happened to you? Come on, wake up!

52
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,633
Wake up!

53
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,473
Are you okay?

54
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,559
Here, drink up.

55
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,813
What on earth happened?

56
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,985
Someone suddenly
struck my head from behind.

57
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,653
Who did?

58
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
I didn't see who because I fainted.

59
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,909
Where's Dr. Bong?

60
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,702
She was with me.

61
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,204
She's okay.

62
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,414
What about Mr. Kim?

63
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,249
He's okay too, right?

64
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,339
Well, the thing is…

65
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,761
There's no use going right now.

66
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,639
There's nothing you can do.

67
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,973
No.

68
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,520
Mr. Kim!

69
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,985
Mr. Kim…

70
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,905
MUJIN POLICE STATION

71
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,868
Can you explain what happened?

72
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,039
Why were you with Mr. Kim Seon-woo?

73
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,752
He said he had something to tell me.

74
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,256
And he asked me to meet him
at the workshop.

75
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,717
Then how did you end up
at the crime scene?

76
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,887
I came out of the workshop,

77
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,766
and then Seon-woo followed me.

78
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,561
And that's when the killer showed up?

79
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,188
Yes.

80
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,983
Did you see the killer's face?

81
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,490
You also ran into the killer
when Ms. Lee was murdered, didn't you?

82
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:36,951
Yes.

83
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,997
You're the only witness

84
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,082
who's met the killer twice.

85
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,009
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

86
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,761
This is footage
from the day of Mr. Jeon's murder.

87
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,807
The crime scene
wasn't that close to the hospital.

88
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,853
But instead of calling the police
or the emergency services,

89
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,940
the victim walked all the way
to your hospital despite the pain.

90
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,109
Why is that?

91
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,904
Was it because
he had something to tell you?

92
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,533
Did you hear anything from him?

93
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,502
You snuck in during
Mr. Park Jong-bae's interrogation.

94
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,340
What did you say to him in there?

95
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,802
Mr. Park…

96
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,473
didn't seem to remember
meeting Seon-woo at nine…

97
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,435
on the night of the murder.

98
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,104
He didn't seem to realize

99
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,815
that he had an alibi.

100
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,860
So I helped him.

101
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,862
And how did you know that? Did you see it?

102
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,662
You're not answering me again.

103
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,588
What is this about?

104
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,840
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

105
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:19,220
Mr. Jeon probably went to
her hospital to ask for help.

106
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,847
The ER would have been too far,

107
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,849
and her hospital must have caught his eye.

108
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,184
It's a hospital after all.

109
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,270
I'm going to need to hear
Ms. Bong's answer.

110
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,648
Since this isn't
any of your business, please leave.

111
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,609
I was the one who let her
into the interrogation room that day.

112
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,777
So talk to me

113
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,530
instead of interrogating
an innocent person.

114
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,951
You're the one who caused
an innocent person to die.

115
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,746
What?

116
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,082
It's a crime for a detective
to be so incompetent.

117
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,961
Don't create more victims,
and just stay in your corner.

118
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,881
You son of a…

119
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,100
Why you little…

120
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,394
Get off me!

121
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,146
-Let go of me!
-Bong Ye-bun.

122
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,355
-Bong Ye-bun.
-Let go!

123
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,607
We have to catch that bastard!

124
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,109
-Let me go.
-Come with us.

125
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,152
-Let's go.
-Come on.

126
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,320
-Let me go!
-Take him.

127
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,072
-Bong Ye-bun!
-Go!

128
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,888
Come on, drink this.

129
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,599
Try to calm down.

130
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,558
Okay.

131
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,360
Calm down.
You're going to pass out at this rate.

132
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,363
I'm trying to calm down,

133
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,491
but I can't stop crying.

134
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,035
We understand.

135
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,663
He was almost like your family.

136
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,499
Right, they lived under the same roof.

137
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,918
This is so unfortunate.

138
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,296
Who's going to take care of his funeral?

139
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,799
Apparently, he had no family.

140
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,969
Then maybe

141
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,514
we should be the ones to send him off.

142
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,185
I'll take care of that.

143
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,312
What do you have in mind?

144
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,192
I should at least perform
a funeral rite for our poor Mr. Kim.

145
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,487
That way, his soul won't wander around,

146
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,405
and he'll move on to the afterlife.

147
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,164
Detective Moon,

148
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,792
are you a thug or a detective?

149
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,879
He's a thuggish detective.

150
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:06,387
Why are you harassing one of our own
instead of going after the gambling ring?

151
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,472
It was originally our case.

152
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,974
Let us close it ourselves.

153
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,727
Who are you to decide?
Are you Oh Seung-hwan the closer?

154
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,272
He'll get in trouble again soon.

155
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,692
We won't be able to cover for him then,
even if we wanted to.

156
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,988
-So await disciplinary action.
-Disciplinary action?

157
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,657
It was just a fistfight between guys.

158
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,701
Is disciplinary action necessary?

159
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,286
You guys crossed the line!

160
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,539
You never take my damn orders seriously!

161
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,167
How many more times do I have to tell you
to get off this case?

162
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,295
I might as well
be talking to a brick wall.

163
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,464
Be grateful that it's just
a one-month suspension.

164
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,551
The next time you butt in,
I'll give you the sack.

165
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,846
Chief, even so…

166
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,930
What are you…

167
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,848
CIVIL SERVANT ID
MOON JANG-YEOL

168
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,519
Hey!

169
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,521
You all better watch out!

170
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,150
Leave the Major Crimes Division alone,
or you'll all face disciplinary action!

171
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,486
Jang-yeol!

172
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,115
Why would you come out? Go back in.

173
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,075
It's just…

174
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,371
The chief said
you should return your car too.

175
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,420
Right.

176
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,051
Bong Ye-bun.

177
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,375
Are you satisfied now?

178
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,419
What are you going to do now?

179
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,880
Seon-woo's dead.

180
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,383
What are you going to do?

181
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,688
Bong.

182
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,605
Get up.

183
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,065
Eat.

184
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,195
I went through so much trouble
to make this for you.

185
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,321
Get up and eat.

186
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm going to leave this here.
You have to at least have a bite, okay?

187
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,350
Did you just wake up?

188
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,811
The ones who live the closest
are always late.

189
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,272
Here's your iced Americano, Jang-yeol.

190
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,232
What are you all doing?

191
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,151
What do you think?

192
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,944
We need to catch the serial killer.

193
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,864
I'll catch him on my own.

194
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,200
You heard the chief yesterday.

195
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,286
If this goes wrong,
you all might get fired.

196
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,581
Who cares?

197
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,500
I've been the breadwinner all this time.

198
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,087
If my husband has a conscience,
he'll find a way to make money for us.

199
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,881
Same here.
I can just inherit my father's boat.

200
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,549
Right.

201
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,426
Here, take this.

202
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,515
I had a sinkhole
kicked into my knees to get you this.

203
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,812
There's a world of difference
between messing around with a police ID

204
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,146
and without it.

205
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,275
Without this, you're nothing
but a common gangster.

206
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,695
You can thank us, you know.

207
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,618
Let's first go to the scene
of Kim Seon-woo's murder

208
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,286
to see if there's any evidence.

209
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,997
I'll go to the National Forensic Service
to see if they found anything.

210
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,207
All right.

211
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,543
What's this?

212
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,713
You don't have a car anymore.

213
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,881
It's my husband's car.

214
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,009
Feel free to use it.
I don't care if you wreck it.

215
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,762
Thanks, I appreciate it.

216
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:03,809
But why on earth
are the windows tinted so dark?

217
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,521
He did this so that no one could see
what he's doing inside.

218
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,523
Some nonsense about
protecting his privacy.

219
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,483
It's pissing me off again.

220
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,526
I'll get going then.

221
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,236
-Okay. Go.
-Yes.

222
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,530
See you.

223
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,121
You don't think
we'd really get fired, do you?

224
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,747
I get extremely seasick.

225
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,168
Can you make decent money
working on a boat?

226
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,588
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

227
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,469
We got this.

228
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,935
The killer created blackouts
with his eyes open.

229
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,689
I'll be able to catch him
once I figure out his trick.

230
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
Hello?

231
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,744
Hello,

232
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,329
what brings you here?

233
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,836
Poor kid.

234
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:24,306
It's not much,
but please use it for his funeral rite.

235
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,975
Thank you.

236
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,566
You need seasoned veggies
for the funeral rite.

237
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,531
Here, I butchered and cooked
my grandson's favorite chicken.

238
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,494
It's not much,

239
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,829
but I caught this myself.

240
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,336
I'm sorry that this is
all I have to offer.

241
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,257
Thank you.

242
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,635
I'll perform a nice rite for him.

243
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,054
Mr. Kim…

244
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,890
will appreciate everyone's offerings.

245
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,366
Hey, didn't I tell you
to at least have a bite?

246
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,870
Are you trying to starve to death?

247
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,583
You should eat up
and get back on your feet

248
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,919
so you can catch the killer
with Detective Moon.

249
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,006
Don't bring up Detective Moon
in front of me.

250
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,758
What's with you?

251
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,595
It's not his fault that Seon-woo died.

252
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,308
He was just doing his job.
He had a good reason to suspect him.

253
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,268
What do you know?

254
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,604
Don't take his side
when you don't even know anything.

255
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,523
I'm not taking his side--

256
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,275
I don't want to hear any more.

257
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,778
-Bong Ye-bun.
-I don't want to hear it.

258
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,405
I told you I'm not hungry.

259
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,282
Why won't anyone listen to me?

260
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,659
Why are you all
just doing whatever you want?

261
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,745
You're the same as Detective Moon.

262
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,204
Get out of my sight.

263
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,023
Ye-bun.

264
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,905
Mr. Park is performing a funeral rite
so Seon-woo can move on to a better place.

265
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,200
I stopped by earlier to chip in,

266
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,496
and the people in the neighborhood
brought him all sorts of nice things.

267
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,084
Let me know
if you want to pitch in anything.

268
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,919
I'll bring it over for you.

269
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,851
Seon-woo.

270
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,894
Seon-woo!

271
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,938
Seon-woo!

272
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,356
No…

273
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,826
Everything including his nails are clean.

274
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,787
There's no evidence
that could point to the killer.

275
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,082
The only thing the victim had on him
was this cell phone.

276
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,795
Did you run it through digital forensics?

277
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,840
Privacy laws are strict these days.

278
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,135
Third parties can't access phones
without consent.

279
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,054
So the phone
can only be accessed by its owner?

280
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,557
Right. Unless you know
the passcode, that is.

281
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,519
Is there absolutely no way to access it?

282
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,313
The phone manufacturer
might be able to help,

283
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,315
but they've recently
denied our request for another case.

284
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,984
So it's basically impossible.

285
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,785
Who said you could touch the evidence?

286
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,414
How many times do I have to tell you
to stay out of this?

287
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,209
Wait, I thought he was the detective
in charge of the case.

288
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,463
That freaking nutjob…

289
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,942
Do you have this pair in a size smaller?

290
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,236
A size 270?

291
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,322
Are you getting a gift for your boyfriend?

292
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,037
He has to go far away,

293
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,333
and I'm worried he'll be barefoot.

294
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,953
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

295
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,454
Yes, Captain?

296
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,624
No, there's nothing to note here either.

297
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,543
I'll head over to the station and…

298
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,055
What were you saying?

299
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,682
Why aren't you answering me?

300
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,643
-Is he passing through a tunnel?
-I'll call you back.

301
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,460
BONG YE-BUN

302
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,767
Bong Ye-bun, I figured it out.

303
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,398
What are you doing?

304
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,984
I know you don't want to hear me out,
but you have to.

305
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,653
I figured out the blackout trick.

306
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,740
It was tinted glass.

307
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,326
That's how you can create blackouts
with your eyes open.

308
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,495
It would look completely dark,
but you can make everything out.

309
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,623
Your eyes would be wide open,
but it would seem like they're closed.

310
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,043
And what are the equivalents
of tinted windows for people?

311
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,711
It's sunglasses.

312
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,921
His trick was wearing sunglasses.

313
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,717
He faked the blackouts
by wearing sunglasses in the dark.

314
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,429
He was stabbing Assemblyman Cha
while wearing sunglasses.

315
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,890
But then your grandfather came in
and turned the lights on.

316
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,893
Blackouts won't work when it's bright,
even with sunglasses on.

317
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,854
So he closed his eyes right away
so you wouldn't be able to catch him.

318
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,731
Then he walked over
and turned the lights off.

319
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,525
That's why there was blood
on the light switch.

320
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,069
It explains everything.

321
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,781
So what?

322
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,245
The killer wore sunglasses
when he murdered people?

323
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,997
And then what?

324
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,959
Are you going to investigate everyone
wearing sunglasses?

325
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,880
I did everything you told me to do,
but it was no use in the end.

326
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,217
None of the people you suspected
were the killer.

327
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,676
They're all dead.

328
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,805
We can't catch him

329
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,723
no matter what we do.

330
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,558
So just stop

331
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,602
before more innocent people get hurt.

332
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,312
You'll be in danger if we give up.

333
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,397
I don't care.

334
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,026
I don't care whether I live or die.

335
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,237
You can't give up so easily.

336
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,406
What about your grandfather and Gwang-sik?

337
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,866
They all tried to save you.

338
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,910
-So don't say--
-Mind your own business.

339
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,664
I was happier
when I didn't have this lousy power.

340
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,668
I just want to go back to the days
when I didn't know you.

341
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,547
So please consider me
a stranger from now on.

342
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,103
GENERAL MACARTHUR

343
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,037
Mr. Park.

344
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,750
I brought this for Seon-woo.

345
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,211
It's sunglasses.

346
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,589
His trick was wearing sunglasses.

347
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,095
Hi, Dr. Bong.

348
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,168
It wasn't the same day.

349
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,085
Mr. Park.

350
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,675
Mr. Park.

351
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,143
Black…

352
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,439
Gwang-sik must have seen this.

353
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,861
Dr. Jung, why did you have to…

354
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,346
Oh, no. Gwang-sik.

355
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,223
You poor thing.

356
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:52,994
Do you get it now?

357
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,747
This.

358
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,250
I guess this gave you a hard time.

359
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,637
But you haven't figured out my power yet,

360
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,972
have you?

361
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,319
VOICE RECORDING

362
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,428
It's eyes for you.

363
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,599
What's really interesting

364
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,978
is that Mr. Kim realized I was the killer

365
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,313
even though he wasn't psychic.

366
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,275
Was it because he was smart enough
to get into Hankook University?

367
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,198
It's such a pity if you think about it.

368
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,618
He was so good-looking and smart.

369
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,330
On top of that, he had a heart of gold.

370
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,671
If only he hadn't been so darn curious,

371
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:31,676
he would have lived a full life
like he was meant to.

372
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,763
Right, Mr. Kim?

373
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:46,607
The people you meet
are what matters the most in life.

374
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,946
Why did he have to come to Mujin,
of all places?

375
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,033
Why did he have to end up
living in my house?

376
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:59,662
And why did he have to take the trash out
at that exact moment?

377
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,554
Why do you have blood on your hand?

378
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,264
Blood?

379
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,640
I don't know.

380
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,100
I'm not sure why.

381
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,611
How did he find out
the knife was in that crock?

382
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,449
Is it because I served
pickled chili peppers for dinner?

383
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,285
He was just way too smart
for his own good.

384
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,463
I'm sorry.

385
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,048
I didn't know you were in here.

386
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,176
It's okay.

387
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,641
I guess that's also how
he figured out my power so quickly.

388
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,268
He wouldn't meet my eyes.

389
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,896
Sorry. I'll close the door.

390
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,030
This is why I hate playing mind games
with smart people.

391
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,132
Why don't you use a paring knife?

392
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,635
This works better.

393
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,520
Would you like

394
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,438
some apple?

395
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,405
No, thank you.

396
00:35:59,031 --> 00:35:59,866
You go ahead.

397
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,502
Hi, Seon-woo.

398
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,102
I thought you'd come alone.

399
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,563
I met Mr. Park out front.

400
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,482
The neighborhood is dangerous these days.

401
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
I saw Dr. Bong
walking all alone in the dark,

402
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,570
so I thought I'd escort her here.

403
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:43,659
And I wanted to see you too.

404
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,121
But I just don't get him.

405
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,249
He clearly knew I was going to kill him.

406
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,751
He was so afraid of me.

407
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,252
So why?

408
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,089
It's to your right once you go inside.

409
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,341
I'll leave you here then.

410
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,552
Come with me, Mr. Kim.

411
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,970
I'm scared.

412
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,517
Why on earth didn't he run away?

413
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,229
Listen, Mr. Kim.

414
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,940
About Dr. Bong…

415
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,817
It'll be your fault

416
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,612
if she dies.

417
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,408
Dr. Bong!

418
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,368
Run!

419
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,452
Run! Hurry!

420
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,123
Was he trying to protect you?

421
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,963
Was he afraid I would kill you?

422
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,674
Where's the knife?

423
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,550
Why do you ask?

424
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,386
So you can hand it over to the police?

425
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,930
Do you think I held the knife
with my bare hands?

426
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,267
The knife won't prove anything.

427
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,978
The same goes for Mr. Kim.

428
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,814
Why did such a clever guy
put himself in danger

429
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,315
just to give you the knife?

430
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,611
Plus, you think
I'd still be holding on to that?

431
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,322
I already burned it.

432
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,825
There is nothing

433
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,536
you can do.

434
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,375
That's right, go tell the police.

435
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,835
"The shaman is the killer."

436
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,920
"I saw it because I'm psychic."

437
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,845
Let's see if you can
make it to the police station.

438
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,111
Are you going to kill me too?

439
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,787
No.

440
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,876
I'll let you live.

441
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,881
You saw it yourself.

442
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,632
Killing your grandpa was a mistake.

443
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,802
I didn't intend to kill him at all.

444
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,888
Why did he have to show up just then?

445
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,392
He had been so nice to me
since I first moved here.

446
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,354
I feel terrible.

447
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,411
That's why I'm not going to kill you.

448
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,247
As a way to say sorry.

449
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,960
So pretend you don't know anything
and go on with your life

450
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,879
so I don't change my mind.

451
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,555
Poor Mr. Kim.

452
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,559
Woe is me.

453
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,062
Woe is me.

454
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,115
Are these for Mr. Kim?

455
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,869
I'll make sure to pass them on.

456
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,956
He'll love them.

457
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,141
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

458
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,858
What are you doing here?

459
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,822
The killer might go after Ye-bun,

460
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,824
so I'm keeping watch.

461
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,744
You could do that right beside her.

462
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,206
That brat wants me out of her sight.

463
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,750
But I can't live without her in my sight.

464
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,794
That's why I have to
protect her like this.

465
00:41:56,764 --> 00:42:00,601
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

466
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,287
Why don't you take more time off?

467
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,831
It's none of your concern.

468
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,917
I'm worried about you.

469
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,628
Why?

470
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,089
Because you want to keep using me?

471
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,345
Dr. Bong and Detective Moon.

472
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,846
There you are.

473
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:50,150
I thought you'd still be grieving,
Dr. Bong.

474
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:54,363
I'm so relieved to see you out and about.

475
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,077
I have something to discuss with Dr. Bong.

476
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,538
Could you give us a moment?

477
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,418
What do you need to…

478
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,594
It seems like
you two had a bit of an argument.

479
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,429
Am I right?

480
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,724
What is this?

481
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,435
Am I getting my shaman powers back?

482
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,229
I'll leave you to talk things out then.

483
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,488
I understand why you don't want to
see me anymore.

484
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,407
I ruined everything.

485
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,075
And I disappointed you.

486
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,911
But we'll never catch
the killer like this.

487
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,663
Is that what you want?

488
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,333
I don't want to care about that anymore.

489
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:48,917
What?

490
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,503
I'm so exhausted.

491
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,381
And I have some regrets.

492
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,594
I should never have helped you
from the very beginning.

493
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,354
Please don't come back here ever again.

494
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,573
-Let go.
-I'll carry it.

495
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,991
I said, let go.

496
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,660
-Let me carry it for you.
-Let go.

497
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,537
-Come on.
-Just let go.

498
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,259
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

499
00:44:58,612 --> 00:44:59,988
No need to feel nervous.

500
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:10,249
It's about the sneakers you bought.

501
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:14,128
I came here to tell you
I passed them on to Mr. Kim.

502
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,092
I'm sure he moved on
to the afterlife wearing them.

503
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,511
No.

504
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,264
You came here to keep an eye on me.

505
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
I'm sure you already saw my past.

506
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,272
Did you see anything?

507
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,194
You would have made a great shaman.

508
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,459
-Get off me!
-Come on, Captain.

509
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,919
I'm just upset!

510
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,338
Let go of me!

511
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,631
Let go!

512
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,134
How could you do this to me?

513
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,095
I've spent half my life in the force.

514
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,055
I was loyal to my country

515
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,683
and devoted to the people.

516
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,144
-So how could you do this to me?
-Captain.

517
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,562
No, don't.

518
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,063
You rude punk!

519
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,232
You can't sideline me like this!

520
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,526
Get him out of here.

521
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,112
-Come here, you!
-What are you doing?

522
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,866
You're in the Major Crimes Division,
so what? Come here.

523
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,119
I'm not going to sit back
if you keep making a scene!

524
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,496
So what are you going to do?

525
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,207
What are you going to do about it?

526
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,001
-Calm down.
-What are you going to do, you bastard?

527
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,921
-Come here! What are you doing to do?
-You're going too far.

528
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,673
-Captain.
-Don't stop me!

529
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,210
"Your birthday"?

530
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,552
Let go.

531
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,970
I'll carry it.

532
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,096
I said, let go.

533
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,474
Just let go!

534
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,399
The shaman is the killer.

535
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,026
Seon-woo's phone, evidence, 0906.

00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:05,882
Mr. Park Jong-bae,

538
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,677
you're under arrest
for the Mujin serial killing.

539
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,221
Excuse me? What do you mean?

540
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,432
It's no use denying it. We have evidence.

541
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:14,808
Evidence?

542
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:34,661
Park Jong-bae.

543
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,039
You killed them all, didn't you?

544
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,666
"Killed"?

545
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,168
Mr. Kim.

546
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,880
That's the past tense.

547
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,884
"Are you going to kill them all?"

548
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,886
That's what you should be asking.

549
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,765
I'm going to keep killing.

550
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,516
Just like I am right now.

551
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,363
Mr. Kim Seon-woo left this behind
as he was dying.

552
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,993
You have the right to remain silent.

553
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:18,497
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

554
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,082
Take him away.

555
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,779
THE LATE KIM SEON-WOO

556
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,580
I guess you feel at home here now.

557
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:51,882
Kim Si-a.

558
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,467
Park Seung-gil.

559
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,510
Lee Ji-suk.

560
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,138
Cha Ju-man. Jung Ui-hwan.

561
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,639
Jeon Gwang-sik.

562
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,975
Kim Seon-woo.

563
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,477
You know them, right?

564
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,483
And we have the identity
of a Korean woman found dead in Australia.

565
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:12,986
Hong Mi-yeon.

566
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,700
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS

567
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,577
Turns out she's your wife.

568
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,871
FAMILY RELATIONS
SPOUSE: HONG MI-YEON

569
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,504
Call Detective Moon.

570
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,633
I won't say a word
unless I'm talking to him.

571
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,306
Zipping my mouth shut.

572
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,224
Zip!

573
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:50,857
I'm sorry.

574
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:58,657
I took it out on you
when I knew it wasn't your fault.

575
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,285
I apologize.

576
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,580
To be honest,

577
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,293
I suspected Seon-woo too.

578
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,090
And I hated myself for it.

579
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,343
It was my fault.

580
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,180
I was too late,

581
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,060
and too many victims were sacrificed.

582
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,733
This will bother me
from time to time when I eat

583
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,944
and give me nightmares too.

584
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,239
It'll be painful as I'm reminded of this

585
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,658
for the rest of my life.

586
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,165
It's all

587
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,043
really over now, right?

588
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,431
Hello?

589
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,892
We need you in the interrogation room.

590
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,935
Is something wrong?

591
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,689
Park Jong-bae is refusing to talk
unless it's with you.

592
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,429
I see you scattered Mr. Kim's ashes.

593
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,475
The ocean can be cold.

594
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,143
You should have buried him
someplace sunny.

595
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,896
Don't you dare look me in the eyes.
I'll gouge them right out.

596
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,023
I'm a shaman.

597
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,691
Eye contact is crucial to my job.

598
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,736
That's how I read people's minds.

599
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,322
And thanks to that,

600
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,034
I even got a superpower.

601
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,536
I should've just stuck to the trail.

602
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,246
This is taking even longer.

603
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,434
What is that?

604
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,524
Did I come the opposite way?

605
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:39,859
Excuse…

606
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:41,736
What?

607
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,512
That cow must have been a divine being.

608
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,933
We made eye contact,
and I could see everything from then on.

609
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,476
It's nice to meet you.

610
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,519
I'm a fan.

611
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,698
You could have used the power
for a good cause.

612
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,242
It would have been perfect,
you being a shaman and all.

613
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:32,203
Instead, the first thing you did
was murder your wife.

614
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,371
Isn't that right?

615
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,750
General MacArthur
must have taken pity on me.

616
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,128
"He doesn't even know
his wife is cheating on him."

617
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,422
"That poor idiot."

618
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,300
That's probably why he gave me this power.

619
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,011
He wanted me to look
into her hideous heart.

620
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,515
All I did was
take the god-given opportunity

621
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,933
and bring judgment upon her.

622
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,355
Get ready to be judged yourself.

623
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,982
The evidence is clear.

624
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,859
You'll rot in prison until you die.

625
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,322
Will I though?

626
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,367
Why do you think I asked for you?

627
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,870
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.

628
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,498
You know what they say in movies?

629
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,669
"I still have one last shot."

630
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,297
Me and my big mouth.

631
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,634
I should keep my mouth shut,
but I can't help myself.

632
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,720
So…

633
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:32,847
you want me to tell you?

634
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:35,433
You think you're some big shot, don't you?

635
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,144
I see the likes of you all the time

636
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:39,854
in my line of work.

637
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:50,865
You feel more guilt than anyone else.

638
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,452
You were desperate to catch me.
This is your chance.

639
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,371
You'll want to listen to me.

640
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,290
You want to make another mistake
like with Kim Seon-woo?

641
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:10,927
Dear me.

642
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,680
My, that's better.

643
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,641
So what's your "last shot"?

644
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,646
You can't expect me to reveal
all my cards for only undoing my cuffs.

645
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,816
Let me ask you something.

646
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,318
Why did you kill them?

647
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,698
My motive for murder?

648
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,075
The police always seem to
obsess over those things.

649
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,412
The keyword to my murders this time

650
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,581
is betrayal.

651
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,501
Yes, your wife betrayed you.
But what about the others?

652
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,211
They had nothing to do with you.

653
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,130
Did your father really get scammed
by Assemblyman Cha?

654
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,256
I plagiarized that.

655
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,633
I copied Mr. Kim's story a bit.

656
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,012
My father left us for another woman
when I was little, and we lost touch.

657
00:57:56,389 --> 00:58:01,144
I guess that's why
I'm this sensitive to betrayal.

658
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,529
That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

659
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:19,204
I should have planned this
more thoroughly.

660
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,247
I'm not much of a planner.

661
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,293
I tried to make the rules after the act,
so they didn't fit the logic.

662
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,965
I didn't necessarily have a motive.

663
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:32,926
It was just

664
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:34,928
for fun.

665
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,679
Fun?

666
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,641
They say

667
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,726
when people die,

668
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,103
their whole life
flashes before their eyes.

669
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,356
When I kill people,

670
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,318
all their memories disappear one by one.

671
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,739
And the one memory that's left
as they breathe their last

672
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,908
is always the best.

673
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:06,042
I wonder what
your one last memory will be.

674
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,963
It'll be of me putting you in jail.

675
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,051
If I go to prison like this,

676
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:18,721
you'll never find out
what my one last shot is.

677
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,975
I guess you want to play games with me.

678
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,810
But I've had enough.

679
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,853
No, wait!

680
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,315
All right, then do this one thing for me.

681
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,401
This one will be easy.

682
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:34,070
Let me

683
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,322
go free.

684
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,242
You really think I would?

685
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,911
You're going to have to let me go.

686
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,290
Or else someone will die.

687
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,167
What?

688
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,086
Come on, Detective Moon.

689
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,880
Will you have someone die
because of you again?

690
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,259
Hyeon-ok.

691
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,678
Hyeon-ok!

692
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,639
Hyeon-ok!

693
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,311
What's wrong?

694
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,147
What's going on?

695
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,318
Are you all right?

696
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,902
I was just… I'm okay.

697
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,948
Ok-hui.

698
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,492
Ok-hui!

699
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,166
Ok-hui.

700
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,337
Have you seen my sister around?

701
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,298
-What?
-She's not home, and I can't reach her!

702
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,363
What are you doing?

703
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,447
Move!

704
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,115
-You can't go in there!
-You can't!

705
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,409
Where's Ok-hui?

706
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,244
Tell me where she is!

707
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,091
Ye-bun, I'm sorry.

708
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,426
You're going through
a tough time as it is, and I…

709
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,954
This must be disappointing,

710
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:52,542
but you can still roughly understand
what's going on, right?

711
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,462
This is the end of my little hint.

712
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,384
You can't see, can you?

713
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,885
Of course, you can't.

714
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,137
I closed my eyes.

715
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,390
You're going to have
a hard time with this one.

716
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,443
I can't see it.

717
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,112
You bastard!

718
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,321
What are you playing at?

719
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,616
You're the ones who started it.

720
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,788
I figured it out too late.

721
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,134
January, February, March

722
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,554
April, May, June

723
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,139
July…

724
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,433
FIRST STEPS TO ARABIC

725
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:59,108
Even as he was dying,
he left a message in Arabic.

726
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,068
But I didn't know what it meant.

727
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,528
Damn it.

728
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,658
I didn't know what it was,

729
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:11,704
but I figured I should
prepare something just in case.

730
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,583
Where's Ok-hui?

731
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:18,211
Look for her.

732
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,005
You have to find her quickly.

733
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:22,965
There's no time.

734
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,233
Let me go free.

735
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,737
That's the only way Bae Ok-hui will live.

736
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:31,450
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

737
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,120
-What are you doing?
-Don't get in my way.

738
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,496
I'm taking him out of here.

739
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,999
We have to go save her right now!

740
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,751
-Keep this up, and Ok-hui dies.
-You asshole.

741
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,919
There's not much time.

742
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,547
Detective, are you okay?

743
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,758
I heard your new partner
is quite fascinating, Detective Moon.

744
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,719
What happened with Park Jong-bae?
You said he already ran away.

745
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,178
I'll bring him in, sir.

746
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,347
We'll have to use our brains to catch him.

747
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,683
If you keep coming,
I'll kill the next person for real.

748
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,019
This bastard will never stop killing.

749
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,562
I told you I'd kill the next person.

750
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,106
And I guess that's you.

751
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:07,194
