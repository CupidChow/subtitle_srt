00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,053
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

3
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,309
What are you doing? You're hurt.

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,810
You're in no condition to go anywhere!

5
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,608
Listen to me.

6
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,359
Your wounds could get infected.

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,320
That's none of your business.

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,119
I'm coming with you.

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,705
Get out.

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,916
No. I'm not letting you go by yourself.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,317
Stop, Detective Moon!

12
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,905
Detective Moon!

13
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,907
Goodness, what is this about?

14
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,450
You're going to kill him!

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,660
Move.

16
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,328
This bastard killed Seung-gil.

17
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,413
Why, you lunatic.

18
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,331
I did what?

19
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,836
I'll take a look and see
if he really did kill him.

20
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,637
Hey, Byeong-ho.

21
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,806
I have a hundred mouths to feed.

22
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,935
If we don't get rid of him,
all 100 of them would starve to death.

23
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,563
So what should we do?

24
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,606
I'll get rid of him.

25
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,691
You will?

26
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,235
Moon Jang-yeol ended up here
because of me.

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,945
Shouldn't I wrap things up?

28
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,533
I'll return after checking
if he's really dead.

29
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,256
It wasn't him.
He's not the one who killed him.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,301
No, this asshole's the one who killed him.

31
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,468
I saw the whole thing!

32
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,680
He did order Seung-gil to kill you,

33
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,765
but he's not the one who killed Seung-gil.

34
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,269
Don't you believe me?

35
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,021
I do.

36
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,856
But…

37
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,817
there are more reasons
I should beat him up.

38
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,569
Detective Moon!

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,615
Hey, Moon Jang-yeol!

40
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,993
I'm glad you're here.

41
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,912
Arrest this bastard.

42
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,958
Someone made a report,
so we have no choice. Come with us.

43
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,293
Take all of them in.

44
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,629
Detective Moon.

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,756
Wait, Detective Moon.

46
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,056
SEOUL GANGBU POLICE STATION

47
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,810
Keep up the good work.

48
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,190
For goodness' sake.

49
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,609
Have you eaten?

50
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,531
My gosh, you're such an impatient guy.

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,244
You should always ask
before hitting someone.

52
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,954
That's how you don't get the wrong person.

53
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,122
Jeez.

54
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,291
Look at this.

55
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,210
Look.

56
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,338
They wouldn't have stabbed him so randomly
if they were to kill him.

57
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,259
They would have gone for specific spots.

58
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,843
Be it his neck or his heart,

59
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,471
they would have gone for
the most lethal spots.

60
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,598
But look at these pictures.

61
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,475
The killer didn't have any spots in mind.

62
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,893
They stabbed wherever they could.

63
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,646
They didn't know where they needed to stab

64
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,107
or how deep they needed to stab
to kill him.

65
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,733
From what I can tell,

66
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,778
this is someone
who's never stabbed anyone before.

67
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,114
This is just too unnecessary.

68
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,575
Why would Baek
send someone so lousy to kill him?

69
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,493
Am I wrong?

70
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
Anyway, hang in there.

71
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,291
I'll see what I can do.

72
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,251
Don't skip any meals.

73
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,089
Goodness. Don't they feed people in Seoul?

74
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,257
That's inhumane.

75
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,471
Did you look into it?

76
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,181
How did you know?

77
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,393
We found evidence
that Baek recently bought fishing boats

78
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,812
and that he was using them
to traffic drugs.

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,480
How did you know?

80
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,815
Do you have an informant?

81
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,864
Yes.

82
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,783
I have an informant.

83
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,328
An informant who knows everything.

84
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,957
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

85
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,633
Thank you for the ride, Captain.

86
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,676
Sure thing.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,263
It's going to take a while
for Detective Moon to get back.

88
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,557
But what's going on between you two?

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,642
Are you guys a thing?

90
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,061
Excuse me?

91
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,146
You guys are an item, aren't you?

92
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,648
There's a rumor going on
in the neighborhood.

93
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,194
That you two went to the mountain
together and everything.

94
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,195
That's absurd.

95
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,280
It's not like that at all.

96
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,365
If you say so.

97
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,910
But isn't it pretty clear
when you've been to the mountain together?

98
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,495
I said it's not like that.

99
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,413
I got it. Get some rest.

100
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,540
It's really not like that.

101
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,666
All right.

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,252
I'm getting more suspicious
because you keep denying it.

103
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,879
See you.

104
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,423
We're not a thing!

105
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,051
For Pete's sake!

106
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,262
How did I get tangled up with that nutjob?

107
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,620
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

108
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,551
I'm actually glad he's not there.

109
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,307
Father, try this.

110
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,185
Ok-hui made these and brought some over.

111
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,243
What's going on?

112
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,912
Did a tofu factory go under somewhere?

113
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,247
I don't know.

114
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,250
She's been frying tofu for days now.

115
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,668
Maybe it's because

116
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
she was conceived in the bean patch.

117
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,723
You're still doing this?

118
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,602
Deok-hee said
Detective Moon can't eat raw tofu.

119
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,730
You don't even know
when he'll be released.

120
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,939
He's coming back today.

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,107
The nutjob's getting out today?

122
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,778
I mean Detective Moon.

123
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,739
Your future husband?

124
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,081
What on earth
do you like about him so much?

125
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,125
He's not scared of me.

126
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,544
Men like that are rare.

127
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,019
They stabbed wherever they could.

128
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,438
They didn't know where they needed to stab

129
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,857
or how deep they needed to stab
to kill him.

130
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,194
From what I can tell, this is someone
who's never stabbed anyone before.

131
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,953
I'll catch whoever did this to you.

132
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,871
I promise.

133
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,754
Detective Moon,
it must've been so hard for you.

134
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:07,755
Have some tofu.

135
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,840
I fried it since you don't eat raw tofu.

136
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,801
Eat this so you don't go to jail again.

137
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,761
I'm good.

138
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,020
Help me.

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,565
What?

140
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,900
There are no CCTVs or eyewitnesses.

141
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,694
No footprints or fingerprints either.

142
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,736
You're all I have

143
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,114
right now.

144
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,369
The only thing I can do for Seung-gil
is catch whoever killed him.

145
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,998
Please help me.

146
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,715
DO NOT ENTER, POLICE LINE
UNDER INVESTIGATION

147
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,342
Is this the scene of the crime?

148
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,304
I need to know
what happened to him here that night.

149
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,520
But I don't see any dogs or cats here.

150
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,064
I can only help you by touching something.

151
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,909
You're not going to
make me do that, are you?

152
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,203
The magpie might have seen it.

153
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,747
Didn't you see?

154
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,373
It just flew away.

155
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,709
There must be babies inside the nest.

156
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,419
Maybe if you touch them…

157
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,714
How am I supposed to climb
all the way up there?

158
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,718
Hold on a second.

159
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,872
You all right?

160
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,624
Keep climbing.

161
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,136
Why is she coming back down?

162
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,354
Wait a second.

163
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,982
Why did you come down?

164
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,193
The babies can't even open their eyes yet.

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,780
I can only see
what they've seen with their eyes.

166
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,125
There's nothing I can touch around here.

167
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,589
A snake!

168
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,845
You said you can see
even if it's out cold.

169
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,888
-I'm scared.
-So am I.

170
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,729
But where is a snake's butt located?

171
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,731
You're the vet. How would I know?

172
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,734
Is it here?

173
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,902
Or here?

174
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,662
Nothing?

175
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,199
Did you see something?

176
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,117
-A raincoat.
-A raincoat?

177
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,744
I saw it when I touched Seung-gil too.

178
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,121
It was too dark and brief then,

179
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,831
but looking at it now,
he was wearing a raincoat.

180
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,333
A raincoat that has a hood

181
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,210
and looks like a cape.

182
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,544
-A rain poncho.
-Yes.

183
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,129
It didn't rain that day though.

184
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:18,923
Anything else?

185
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,676
The guy had a staggering walk.

186
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,220
Staggering? Was he drunk?

187
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,889
No, he didn't seem drunk.

188
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,140
Anyway, he staggered.

189
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,518
And he was stabbing Seung-gil all over.

190
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,061
It was awful.

191
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,148
That one.

192
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,900
-That one?
-Yes.

193
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,817
Good job!

194
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,030
Do you want that?

195
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,632
Seon-woo?

196
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,553
Do you remember anyone
who recently bought a rain poncho?

197
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,554
Jeez.

198
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:10,558
Who doesn't wear a rain poncho
around here?

199
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,143
You can't be holding up an umbrella

200
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,854
while working in fields
or on boats now, can you?

201
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,590
Bye, Ok-hui!

202
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:43,799
See you, Auntie.

203
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,347
NO.1 CHA JU-MAN

204
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,558
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man.

205
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,475
Thank you.

206
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,437
I'll make our beautiful Mujin…

207
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,615
What now?

208
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,909
The rain poncho is the only clue we have.

209
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,995
If anyone could have a rain poncho…

210
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,748
That means anyone could be the killer.

211
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,837
The killer was wearing a rain poncho?

212
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,088
How do you know that?

213
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,884
The victim told me.

214
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,177
The victim?

215
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,387
Yes. Before Seung-gil died,

216
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,723
he told me he was attacked
by someone wearing a rain poncho.

217
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,768
Why are you telling me this now?

218
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,937
But aren't rain ponchos
common around here?

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,981
We all have one at home.

220
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,984
It didn't rain that day.

221
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,363
For someone to wear a rain poncho
when it wasn't raining…

222
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,448
It means he wanted to
easily wipe the blood away.

223
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,535
The crime was premeditated.

224
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,173
Why does your boyfriend
keep badgering people?

225
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,887
What's wrong?

226
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,935
Why does Ok-hui have
such a gloomy look on her face?

227
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,645
I should touch her and see.

228
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,688
Don't.

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,608
You're being weird today.

230
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,445
No need. It's chump change anyway.

231
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
-"One more bottle."
-Just go.

232
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,959
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
Take a seat.

233
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,763
Auntie.

234
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,057
I'm fine. This happens all the time.

235
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,392
This knife…

236
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,311
Hey!

237
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,942
That heartless brat.
Can't she see that I'm hurt?

238
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,034
-What's that?
-Detective Moon.

239
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,535
What are you doing?

240
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,704
Dr. Bong, calm down. What's going on?

241
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,415
-Did you come here like this?
-Yes.

242
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,458
By bus?

243
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,584
Yes.

244
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,335
What is this?

245
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,672
This is the same knife
the guy in the rain poncho was holding.

246
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,467
Let me see.

247
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,263
Detective Bae, compare this knife
with Park Seung-gil's stab wounds.

248
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,432
Detective Na, find out where this is sold

249
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,017
and look into everyone who bought it.

250
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,727
What's going on?

251
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,355
This seems to be the same kind of knife
used to kill Park Seung-gil.

252
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,109
What are you doing? Get to work.

253
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,361
I have this knife at home too.

254
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,572
We have a few at home too.

255
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,575
I have a whole set of those.

256
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,328
What's the point
of identifying the weapon?

257
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,830
Everyone has a few of those at home.

258
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,334
Everyone bought it back when it was a fad.

259
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,629
I'm pretty sure almost everyone in Mujin
owns at least one.

260
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,882
Still, one thing's for sure.

261
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,841
What is?

262
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,969
That the killer is a Mujin resident.

263
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,599
I guess the RIU
really is on a different level.

264
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,976
We haven't even found
the actual murder weapon yet.

265
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,187
So how can you be so sure?

266
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,897
Hey, Deok-hee.

267
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,609
Go and arrest
all 30,000 residents of Mujin.

268
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,694
Are you serious?

269
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,114
Yes, go ahead and arrest all of them.

270
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,156
You're joking, right?

271
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,659
Took you long enough, you idiot.

272
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,756
Goodness.

273
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,050
Are my eyes aging?

274
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,554
Mr. Park.

275
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,889
Are you busy?

276
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,768
No, I was just…

277
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,437
What are you doing with that?

278
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,858
-There's a hole in it.
-Oh, give it here.

279
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,820
Isn't it hard
supporting your family abroad?

280
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,199
It is, but I still have to do it
for my kid.

281
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,621
Mr. Park.

282
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,832
When someone…

283
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,959
becomes a shaman,

284
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,752
can they see things,

285
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,381
read peoples' minds, see the future,

286
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,466
catch criminals, and all that?

287
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,598
Since they can see
with the eyes of a deity…

288
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,893
So there were some shamans
who did catch criminals.

289
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,104
How can I become a shaman?

290
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,647
It's not just for everyone.

291
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,567
Only chosen people can.

292
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,818
You told Ye-bun to do it.

293
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,987
She was different.

294
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,366
And I needed some quick cash at the time.

295
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,869
Do you think I can become one?

296
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,955
You know that everyone
calls me crazy in this neighborhood.

297
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,126
Everything I do goes wrong,
and my relationships don't last long.

298
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,086
Doesn't this mean
I should become a shaman?

299
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,588
That's because you have a nasty…

300
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
I mean…

301
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,014
Anyway, you can't become a shaman.

302
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,433
I don't care. Make me a shaman.

303
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,644
It's not something you can force.

304
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,940
And there are other solutions
than becoming a shaman.

305
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,194
Like praying, performing rites,
or using talismans.

306
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,738
So just tell me.

307
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,491
What's the problem?

308
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,159
Well…

309
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,245
Can you make someone

310
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,706
fall head over heels for me?

311
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,958
You mean Detective Moon?

312
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,167
No way. How did you know?

313
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,837
I heard that you played the accordion.

314
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,216
Many young men moved away
from this neighborhood that night.

315
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,176
They felt too uneasy to stay.

316
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,721
So would you like a talisman?

317
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,268
One talisman
can bring anyone into your life.

318
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,938
Mr. Park.

319
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,357
Don't you cut corners.

320
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,817
What?

321
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,861
Come on! I've seen other shamans
use chicken blood.

322
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,322
You knew about that?

323
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,409
I'm a bit scared of chickens.

324
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,703
Have you heard of Ornithophobia?
Fear of birds?

325
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,081
Give me a minute.

326
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,381
I brought you the chicken, sis.

327
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,176
You're a mess.

328
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,097
It's because I got this
purebred Korean chicken myself.

329
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,181
Here.

330
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,519
Thank you for this. Come on in.

331
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,524
I mean no offense, but I'm a Christian.

332
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,067
So I'll have to pass, sis.

333
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,655
But I'm offended!

334
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,409
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

335
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,168
Put this talisman in his underwear.

336
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,297
Why do shamans always tell people
to put things in underwear?

337
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,182
There you go.

338
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,574
Why is she hanging from there
like she's the national flag?

339
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,659
I have no idea.

340
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,620
I gave up on trying to understand her
since elementary school.

341
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,288
I think she has eyes for Detective Moon.

342
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,248
What?

343
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,417
Isn't he out of her league?

344
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,128
-He is.
-Right.

345
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,838
He's super charming.

346
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,758
Anyway, should we help her down?

347
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,176
No, leave her be.

348
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,054
She'll ask for help when she's tired.

349
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,264
That'll take all night.

350
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,308
This watermelon is good.

351
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,351
So sweet.

352
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,310
Right.

353
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,104
Let's finish it before she falls off.

354
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,660
Something bad always happens
on these kinds of days.

355
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,456
My dog's been having diarrhea

356
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,501
and has been on low energy
for a few days now.

357
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,795
All right.

358
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,797
If that's the case, I'll take a look.

359
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,699
Has your dog run away from home recently?

360
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,201
How did you know?

361
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,538
My puppy's so smart
that it keeps undoing its leash.

362
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,874
I think your puppy drank seawater
when it was out.

363
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,959
Seawater is high in salinity,

364
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,754
so it can be dangerous
for dogs with bad kidneys.

365
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,631
Have your dog drink water often,

366
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,758
and soak its kibble in water
for the time being.

367
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,551
Okay.

368
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,666
What is it? Suicide?

369
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,417
Not likely.

370
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,753
They found stab wounds on the body.

371
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,380
Then it's another murder?

372
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,525
-Do we know who she is?
-Her body is too decomposed,

373
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,277
so they're still investigating.

374
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,903
Dr. Bong found the body?

375
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,821
Yes.

376
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:29,629
What could push someone
to do this to a person?

377
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,757
The stab wounds are too inconsistent
for one person to have done it.

378
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,217
Maybe there were several people.

379
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,637
It's as if the killer stabbed her randomly
with their eyes closed.

380
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:41,933
What?

381
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,436
Understood.

382
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,521
What is it?

383
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,398
The victim has been identified.

384
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,399
Who is it?

385
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,984
It's someone we know.

386
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,652
The streamer.

387
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,737
How did you know?

388
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,574
It was Streamer Ms. Si-a,
Yeom Jong-hyeok's abduction victim.

389
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,786
But Yeom Jong-hyeok
is in detention right now.

390
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,080
How did you know that it was her?

391
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,540
Her earrings.

392
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,169
Now, hold on!

393
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,714
What's going on here?

394
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,760
Mujin has never seen any murders before.

395
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:21,598
But now there's been
two murders already on my watch.

396
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,186
This is why I didn't want to get promoted.

397
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,731
Listen up.

398
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,358
Detective Na and Detective Bae,

399
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,235
look into anyone who might have had
grudges against the victim

400
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,988
and find out her last whereabouts.

401
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:41,785
Dig into every detail of when and where
she was murdered and dumped.

402
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,828
And Detective Moon, you…

403
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,165
You focus on Park Seung-gil's case, okay?

404
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,751
I'll investigate Si-a's murder too.

405
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,671
How long were you Si-a's manager?

406
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,466
A bit less than two years.

407
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,636
When was the last time you saw her?

408
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,971
The day she was discharged
from the hospital.

409
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,099
About two weeks ago.

410
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,769
And you never reached out to her once
in those two weeks.

411
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:10,480
It was normal for her
to go off the grid from time to time.

412
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,276
Did she mention whether
she was meeting up with anyone?

413
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,824
You're the victim's boyfriend, right?

414
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,242
I am,

415
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,494
but I was going to break up with her.

416
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,124
Her manager said you were supposed to
meet up with her that night.

417
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,418
She said she would come over
but never showed up.

418
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,169
And I didn't hear anything more from her.

419
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,797
Did you not suspect anything

420
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,258
when she didn't show up?

421
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,052
She used to change her mind about things
all the time.

422
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,471
So I didn't think much of it.

423
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,265
Anyway, I don't know anything.

424
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,726
The last time I saw her
was at the convenience store.

425
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,853
The convenience store?

426
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,150
I remember her.

427
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,819
She was here to buy beer that day.

428
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,029
She gave me her number.

429
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,239
Give me a call.

430
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,741
I'll buy you a drink.

431
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,078
Did you ever give her a call?

432
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,163
No.

433
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,831
I didn't want to.

434
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,171
Did you see her with anyone else?

435
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,630
Ms. Si-a.

436
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,132
GENERAL MACARTHUR TV

437
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,092
Yes, that's me.

438
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,177
Hello.

439
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,012
This was that day.

440
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,805
It's nice to meet you.

441
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,392
But she was very different in real life.

442
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:30,852
What do you mean?

443
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,271
-I'm also on MeTube.
-I mean…

444
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:38,359
How should I put this?
She behaved quite differently on camera.

445
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,820
First, the energy of water and trees.

446
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,864
And I'm not talking about
just any old water or trees…

447
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,948
Wait.

448
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,159
…I'll read your fortune.

449
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,204
Okay, I can't wait.

450
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,830
First, the energy of water and trees.

451
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,832
And I'm not talking about
just any old water or trees.

452
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,876
What I mean by that is…

453
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,961
I got her call history,

454
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,174
and an employee of the auto repair shop
called her a lot around that time.

455
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,638
I think it was about two weeks ago.

456
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,640
I went to tow the car
after getting a call,

457
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,475
but no one was there when I got there.

458
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,352
The driver wouldn't pick up,

459
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,103
so I just brought the car back.

460
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,731
Do you know how the accident occurred?

461
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,107
I have no idea.

462
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,691
Was there anyone besides her manager

463
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,152
who visited her at this hospital?

464
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,114
There wasn't anyone like that, but…

465
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,574
Anything you want to tell me?

466
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,534
Actually…

467
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,995
You know the lady
who works at the animal hospital?

468
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,414
It seemed like
she was in an argument with her.

469
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,291
Sure, the streamer was rude.

470
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,668
But the lady seemed like a handful too.

471
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,546
A "handful"?

472
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,841
She might come across as cold,

473
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,136
but she's very thoughtful
and warm-hearted on the inside.

474
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,598
Don't be too quick to judge someone.

475
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,058
Okay.

476
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,821
Did you track her account?

477
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,822
I did.

478
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,201
Her last transaction was made
at the convenience store two weeks ago.

479
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,621
But there's something odd.

480
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,122
What is it?

481
00:31:56,205 --> 00:32:00,418
Assemblyman Cha's office
transferred her some money.

482
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,840
WITH STREAMER MS. SI-A
NO.1 CHA JU-MAN

483
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,551
Number One.

484
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,386
Number One.

485
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,472
I heard she was a famous streamer,

486
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,266
so I asked her
to be in my promotional video.

487
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,809
You paid her a lot of money.

488
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,186
Don't get me started.

489
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,147
She was adamant that we pay that price

490
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,358
and wouldn't let us
use the video otherwise.

491
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:29,155
She even threatened to badmouth Mr. Cha
on her channel, so we had to…

492
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,825
That's enough.
There's no need to mention that.

493
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,078
Did you ever meet her again after that?

494
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,580
No, I didn't.

495
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,166
We parted ways
as soon as we filmed that video.

496
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,044
Thank you.

497
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,427
Keep the reporters silent.

498
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,389
We don't want any unnecessary rumors.

499
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,515
Yes, sir.

500
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,030
People like her suck you dry
if they think you're a pushover.

501
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,992
God knows how many families
she's destroyed.

502
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,161
Serves her right.

503
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,873
She can't expect to live a carefree life
after destroying someone else's family.

504
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,791
Sorry?

505
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,960
I'm coming down. Get the car ready.

506
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,756
I bet there are many things
you want to know about me.

507
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,051
I'm going to answer
all your questions honestly…

508
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,302
What are you watching?

509
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,847
I'm looking for potential suspects
from the comment section.

510
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,100
I'm sure there were a lot of people
who wanted to harm her.

511
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,314
Yes, Captain.

512
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,941
I'm on my way in.

513
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,403

HYPOCRITES LIKE YOU MUST DIE!

What are you doing here?

518
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,217
Get some rest. You must have been shocked.

519
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,303
I was worried.

520
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,014
I heard the victim was Ms. Si-a.

521
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,266
Yeah.

522
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,143
Who did it?

523
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,937
We're still investigating.

524
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,816
We're mainly looking into the people
the victim last met,

525
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,651
but it hasn't been easy.

526
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
Who in the world would do such a thing?

527
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,699
What we've learned so far

528
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,535
is that there was a car accident
on the day of the incident.

529
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,580
The car was found,
but the person disappeared.

530
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,082
A car accident?

531
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:44,999
Yes.

532
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,876
Why?

533
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,172
Did that accident happen

534
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,549
when Si-a's car ran into a pile of metal

535
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,218
on the side of the road?

536
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,552
How did you know that?

537
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,472
I saw it when I touched
Gwang-sik's butt the other day.

538
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,974
I saw him getting into
a car accident with Si-a.

539
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,376
Excuse me.

540
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,295
Do you recognize her, by any chance?

541
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,342
It's that woman.

542
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,679
She and I almost got into
an accident a while ago.

543
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,557
Her car got smashed, so I offered to help.

544
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,183
But she sent me away.

545
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,895
You remember her very clearly
despite the brief interaction.

546
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,605
It's been a whole two weeks too.

547
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,401
She was such a beauty.

548
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,112
But why do you ask?

549
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,114
Is something wrong?

550
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,533
She…

551
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,576
died.

552
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,035
What?

553
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,579
How?

554
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,207
That's still under investigation.

555
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,336
Goodness, Detective.

556
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,922
Why do you have so much lint on you?

557
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,174
It's fine.

558
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,386
If you remember anything else,
please contact the station.

559
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,894
This is my house.

560
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,647
I was on my way home,
and she hit me out of nowhere.

561
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,942
I thought he was trying to assault me.

562
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,861
Since it turned out
to be a misunderstanding,

563
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,405
let's just let things go and move on.

564
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,658
Take her home.

565
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,784
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

566
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,743
Let's go.

567
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,869
But…

568
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,082
What is this neighborhood coming to?

569
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,712
You're still here?

570
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,633
I had to check something.

571
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,346
STREAMER MS. SI-A MURDER CASE

572
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,937
I told you to focus on
Park Seung-gil's murder.

573
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,855
So why are you obsessing over this case?

574
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,817
Once we catch Si-a's killer,

575
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,361
we'll know who killed Seung-gil as well.

576
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,030
What in the world are you talking about?

577
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,366
They could be the same person.

578
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,537
Seung-gil's killer
could also have killed Si-a.

579
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,206
How so?

580
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,583
You saw the wounds on the victims.

581
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,003
They were attacked with the same weapon
in the same manner.

582
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,883
I told you.

583
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,261
That knife is a dime a dozen
here in Mujin.

584
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,972
And what do you mean,
"in the same manner"?

585
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:29,765
They were just stabbed randomly.

586
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,767
Let's say we go with your idea

587
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,312
and consider there are two killers
with the same weapon.

588
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,939
But two novices
who'd never killed anyone before

589
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,984
committing murder in the same area
around the same time?

590
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,819
Leaving similar-looking wounds?

591
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,448
How likely do you think that is?

592
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,368
I'm sure there's only one killer.

593
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,370
Are you insane?

594
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,208
Do you even have any idea
what you just said?

595
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,002
You're saying there's a serial killer!

596
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,714
What you just said could bring chaos
to the neighborhood,

597
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,674
cause the housing prices to drop,

598
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,551
and stop tourists from visiting!

599
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,179
Then it wouldn't just be me

600
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,890
losing a job at this station!

601
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,268
Who do you think you are?
I've been too easy on you, haven't I?

602
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,980
Why, you little bastard.

603
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,824
Goodness, the neighborhood is going crazy.

604
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,161
We used to have zero crimes in this town.

605
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,705
And now, we've already found
two dead bodies.

606
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,126
I'm too scared to live here now.

607
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,630
There were cops in town yesterday too
because there was a suspicious person.

608
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,593
I have to walk along the beach
on my way home,

609
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,221
and it makes me so nervous.

610
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,847
Take a detour.

611
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,476
That would do it.

612
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,187
I'm too scared
to even go to the bathroom now.

613
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,897
Use a potty.

614
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,941
Right, that would do it.

615
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,528
Our village leader has all the answers.

616
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,405
It must be nice to live with him.

617
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,073
Yes, take him with you later.

618
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,741
-For Pete's sake, woman.
-It hurts.

619
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,034
But you see,

620
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,995
no one in our village
would do such a thing.

621
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
Maybe it was an outsider.

622
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,791
What? An outsider?

623
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,917
Yes.

624
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,004
Like the men from Seoul
who came here to buy the vacant lots.

625
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,675
They looked like a bunch of thugs.
Very suspicious.

626
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,884
It wasn't them.

627
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,302
-What?
-What?

628
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,721
How do you know that?

629
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,723
They gave me rice cakes as a gift.

630
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,685
Anyone who shares food
can't be a bad person.

631
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,769
That's true.

632
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,481
Then maybe it's those outsiders

633
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,151
who put up their tents
to fish around here.

634
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
It can't be them.

635
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,572
-Why not?
-I asked them,

636
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,366
and they attended
Mujin Elementary School until third grade.

637
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,579
-So I was wrong.
-Right.

638
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,706
Then who on earth could it be?

639
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,208
At this rate, our housing prices
will hit rock bottom.

640
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,753
As if our housing prices ever went up.

641
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,797
They've been the same
for the past 20 years.

642
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,134
This is why I said we shouldn't cut down
that hackberry tree 20 years ago!

643
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,887
It was your grandfather who cut it down!

644
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,929
Was it now?

645
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,098
Why did he do that?

646
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,393
Maybe we should have a shaman
perform a rite or something.

647
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,770
Right. That's a good idea.

648
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:26,317
Maybe the whole village
should hold a rite together.

649
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,111
We once managed
to calm down the stormy sea

650
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:32,740
by holding a rite, remember?

651
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,952
Goodness, how can you say that
when your wife's a deacon at a church?

652
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,163
What are you talking about?

653
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,374
We have freedom of religion
in this nation.

654
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,669
-For goodness' sake.
-If we have to hold a rite, we should!

655
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,713
-Are you planning to hold a rite?
-What?

656
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,465
Goodness me, when did you get here?

657
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:51,258
Just now.

658
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,259
I see.

659
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,345
The neighborhood feels so unsettled.

660
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,263
Right?

661
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,225
There's something definitely wrong.

662
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,561
Are you really going to hold a rite?

663
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,479
What?

664
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:09,109
It's not my decision to make.

665
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,613
I should first announce this
to the neighborhood.

666
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,035
May I have your attention, please?

667
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,248
There has been a series of crimes recently

668
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,377
in our neighborhood
that are too heinous to describe.

669
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,923
I advise all women and the elderly

670
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,676
not to wander around late at night.

671
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:37,805
I urge you all to go home early.

672
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:43,519
There will be a public meeting tomorrow
at the village hall about this issue.

673
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,022
I highly advise you all to attend.

674
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,821
Why did you come out?

675
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,739
To walk you home.

676
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,158
I'm okay.

677
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,785
Your shift isn't over yet.

678
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,454
I talked to my boss.

679
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,748
It's dangerous at night.
Let me come with you.

680
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,876
Okay.

681
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,886
Well then. You should go inside.

682
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,639
Thank you for walking me home.

683
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,268
Dr. Bong.

684
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,811
Yes?

685
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,523
Don't walk around alone at night.

686
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,985
Make sure to call me
when you have to go somewhere.

687
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,737
I'll accompany you.

688
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,864
What's going on?

689
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,032
Does he like me?

690
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,576
No, he's probably just sweet by nature.

691
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,454
But that doesn't mean
he's sweet to everyone.

692
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,956
He's doing this
because he has feelings for me.

693
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,666
Because he likes me.

694
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,376
Hi, Seon-woo.

695
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,296
Hello, Ms. Jung.

696
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,464
You've been grocery shopping?

697
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,968
I'm making japchae and gimbap.

698
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,804
Don't walk alone at night anymore.

699
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:05,100
It's dangerous to walk alone these days.
Be sure to call me when you go somewhere.

700
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,185
I'll accompany you.

701
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,022
I guess he's sweet to anyone. This bast…

702
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,649
How sweet of you.

703
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,692
He's basically everyone's safety officer.

704
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,487
Let's go in and put the groceries away.

705
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,963
Don't just stand there and sit.

706
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,472
Why did you call me?

707
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,312
I'm going to ask you point-blank.

708
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,067
Do you really think there's one killer?

709
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,694
Yes.

710
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,491
Then convince me.

711
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,912
What is the motive
behind these two cruel murders?

712
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,331
I don't know.

713
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,917
What do the two victims have in common?

714
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,503
Nothing we could find so far.

715
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,925
So you don't know the motive,

716
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,052
and the victims have nothing in common.

717
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,180
But you think there's only one killer?

718
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,182
A serial killer?

719
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,934
Yes.

720
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:30,853
Jeez.

721
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,863
I didn't think being unmarried at this age
would help me out like this.

722
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,784
If I had a wife and kids,
I wouldn't be so brave.

723
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,622
Go ahead and investigate.

724
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,836
I was going to go on a cruise
in the Mediterranean Sea after retirement.

725
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,089
I guess riding a pedal boat
on Sapgyoho Lake would do.

726
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,219
But since I can't pedal by myself
because of my bad knees,

727
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,598
you can come along and do it for me.

728
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,143
I'll get you on the cruise.

729
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,064
Give it here.

730
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,569
Keep your word.

731
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,831
SUA-RI VILLAGE HALL

732
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,999
Oh, my goodness.

733
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,209
You made it.

734
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,418
Good to see you, sir.

735
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,377
Hello.

736
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,844
-Oh, my.
-Hello.

737
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,180
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Don't mention it.

738
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,598
-Come on in.
-Hello, ma'am.

739
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,227
We will now begin the village meeting.

740
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,108
I asked you all to gather here today

741
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:05,447
to hear all of your opinions

742
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,284
on whether or not
we should hold a rite as a village.

743
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:14,248
So please don't hesitate

744
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,626
to share your honest opinions.

745
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,259
It's a bit awkward

746
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,844
for me to say this.

747
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,389
But our village has held huge rites

748
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,933
whenever something like this
happened in the past

749
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,853
to keep the negative energy
of the land in check.

750
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,771
-Right.
-Right.

751
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:42,609
It was to keep people with bad intentions
from stepping foot into Mujin at all.

752
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,445
-Right, we should.
-We should keep the bad energy at bay.

753
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,614
I'm against the rite.

754
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,534
Those things are all just superstitions.

755
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,954
Don't you think we're better off
getting CCTVs with the money?

756
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,957
If we had CCTVs, we would have
already caught the killer by now.

757
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,917
-That's right.
-I agree.

758
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,419
So Assemblyman Cha,

759
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,797
why didn't you install more CCTVs

760
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,217
while you were still in office?

761
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,222
To be honest,
this neighborhood never needed them.

762
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,558
There were no crimes here.

763
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,144
But considering recent events,

764
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:21,481
I promise to install CCTVs in every alley

765
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,151
and make Mujin a crimeless city again
if I'm elected.

766
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,862
Look at me, everyone.

767
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,156
My opponent didn't even show up

768
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,908
while I'm here and paying attention.

769
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,243
-He's right.
-Yes.

770
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,705
Vote for Cha Ju-man, candidate number one.

771
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,791
Vote for Cha Ju-man, candidate number one.

772
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,252
-Vote for Cha Ju-man.
-Are you here to win votes?

773
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,383
Outsiders have no say in this.

774
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,887
Sir.

775
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,097
I may not have grown up here,

776
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,600
but I'm still one of the residents.

777
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,602
Says who?

778
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,230
Everyone gathered here
was born and raised here.

779
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,608
The same goes for Assemblymen Cha.

780
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,444
He's been working hard
for this neighborhood for decades.

781
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,989
It's all right, sir.

782
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,991
I value everyone's opinion.

783
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,454
I apologize if it looked like
I was here solely to win votes.

784
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,041
Listen up, everyone.

785
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,629
What's more important
than telling outsiders apart from insiders

786
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:30,884
is deciding on whether or not
we'll hold a village rite.

787
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,970
Rites cost so much money.

788
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,307
I don't want our village funds
to be wasted on something like that.

789
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,809
Oh, you.

790
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,352
The rite won't cost that much.

791
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,856
Do you think I'll rip off
my fellow villagers or something?

792
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,526
I'll only charge you
for the labor and materials costs.

793
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,986
Rites are temporary,

794
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,864
but CCTVs will last for a long time.

795
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,326
I doubt CCTVs can prevent incidents.

796
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,245
We need to strengthen
the energy of the village

797
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,831
to stop terrible things from happening.

798
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,834
Mr. Onion, you ate the snacks
you got from the church last time,

799
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,836
so why haven't I seen you there
on Sundays?

800
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,295
The Buddhist temple gave me rice cakes.

801
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,756
Right, nothing beats rice cakes.

802
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,802
This is all because we cut down
that ginkgo tree 20 years ago.

803
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,388
Your grandfather cut that down too.

804
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,806
Excuse me.

805
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,142
But aren't you handing out
any rice cakes today?

806
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,309
For Pete's sake.

807
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,271
This isn't a happy occasion,
so why would we have rice cakes?

808
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,065
I'm telling you, we need to install CCTVs!

809
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,651
Come on, we need to hold a rite!

810
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,945
Why don't we plant back
the trees that were cut down?

811
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,447
Calm down, everyone.

812
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,950
This is going to turn into a fight.

813
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,368
What?

814
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,286
What the…

815
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,164
Sorry I'm late.

816
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,582
Hey, Gwang-sik.

817
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,210
Are you all for rites?
Or are you not for rites?

818
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,754
Excuse me?

819
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,132
Are you all rites? Or are you no rites?

820
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,259
I'm all right.

821
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,427
There.

822
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,095
So you're for it.

823
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,889
We're also all for rites.

824
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,808
-There he is.
-He's coming out.

825
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,435
-Gosh!
-Goodness!

826
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,020
-Good job.
-He's here.

827
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,522
You can trust me, everyone.

828
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,482
-Right.
-Of course.

829
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,777
General MacArthur will help us.

830
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,820
-We believe in you.
-Please do a good job.

831
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,489
Please do your best.

832
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,948
A round of applause!

833
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,119
Deokgu? For how long?

834
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,707
Don't worry too much, sir.
I'll be right over.

835
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,459
Auntie!

836
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,086
Auntie!

837
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,131
Where on earth is she?

838
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,892
What is this about?

839
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,936
Is Father doing well?

840
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,729
Don't call him that.

841
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,648
Then how else should I call him?

842
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,400
Just because you and I are divorced
doesn't mean he's a stranger.

843
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,695
Hey, Jong-muk.

844
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,658
Long time no see. How have you been?

845
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,744
Hey, Gyeong-taek.

846
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,108
Why is that brat
wandering around alone this late?

847
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,653
Hey, you!

848
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,448
You scared the shit out of…

849
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:43,118
"Shit"?

850
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,035
Did you say "shit"?

851
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,748
Snot out of me.

852
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,250
You scared the snot out of me.

853
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,003
If you're so scared,
why are you wandering alone at night?

854
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,213
I'm making a house call.

855
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,299
Deokgu is in critical condition.

856
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,968
How reckless. You might end up
in critical condition yourself.

857
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:01,845
Let's go.

858
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,388
You're coming with me?

859
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,934
I need you.

860
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,067
Who's going to catch the killer?

861
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,529
That's your job as a detective.

862
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,824
Eyes forward.

863
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,242
Let's go.

864
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,251
How's the investigation going?

865
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,173
I think Seung-gil and Si-a
were murdered by the same person.

866
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,133
Really?

867
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,471
Then does that mean
there's a serial killer in Mujin?

868
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,224
Nothing's for sure yet,
but the chances are very high.

869
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,518
Then you have to hurry up and catch him.

870
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,688
That's why you have to help me.

871
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,776
You always start by asking for help
only to threaten me later.

872
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,779
Will you help me or not?

873
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,407
What exactly do you want me to do?

874
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,912
The culprit is definitely
a Mujin resident.

875
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,207
So touch everyone from Mujin.

876
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,042
You're insane.

877
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,086
How am I supposed to touch
all those people?

878
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,337
Come on.

879
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,006
You think someone
who killed two people won't kill again?

880
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,758
What if there's another murder?

881
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,094
Are you going to sit around
and wait for the next victim?

882
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,847
A reckless criminal
calls for reckless investigations.

883
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,018
There are 30,000 people in Mujin.

884
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,271
It would only take you a month
if you touch 1,000 people per day.

885
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,441
Okay, let's do this.

886
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,570
-Hey.
-Yes?

887
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,780
Give me your money.

888
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,824
Give it to me.

889
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,283
I don't have any money.

890
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,786
I'm going to hit you
for every little coin I find.

891
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,663
Search him.

892
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:53,540
You little punks.

893
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,009
The hell are you looking at?

894
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,100
Carry some cash on you, all right?

895
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,018
Scram.

896
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,729
I said, go home.

897
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,856
Who are you?

898
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,235
Got any cigarettes on you?

899
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,363
-What?
-You're dead meat if I find any.

900
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,122
You rascals…

901
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,751
Carry some cigarettes on you, all right?

902
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,878
Get lost.

903
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,630
Not leaving?

904
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,384
Then I'll go.

905
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,898
I was so scared I thought I would die.

906
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,442
That was pretty good.
Did you fool around back in the day?

907
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,332
Mr. Park.

908
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,918
You said you were afraid of birds.

909
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,629
That's why I'm getting rid of it.

910
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,760
Your face tells me
things didn't go well with Detective Moon.

911
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,764
I think he has someone else in his mind.

912
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,140
Who?

913
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,267
That's none of your business.

914
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,357
Is there any talisman that makes things
not work out between them?

915
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,775
Of course.

916
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,197
Those talismans are more effective.

917
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,992
Your emotions are bound to be stronger

918
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,287
when you wish misfortune on others
than when you wish them well.

919
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,085
Can it make sure
things don't work out between them?

920
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,338
The way this talisman works

921
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,134
is that it'll bring bad luck
to whatever they do.

922
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,887
That's why their relationship
won't work out either.

923
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,059
But I advise you not to get it.

924
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,022
Because it all comes back to you later.

925
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,993
Hello, sir.

926
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,453
Hello, Ok-hui.

927
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,165
Is Ye-bun home?

928
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,000
I think she's out.

929
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,463
Then I'll just go wait in her room.

930
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,900
Stop, you punk!

931
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,028
You're killing me.

932
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,036
Go stand at the end of the line.

933
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,121
All right. Next.

934
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,589
You can go.

935
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,548
Next.

936
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,345
Next.

937
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,555
All right, next.

938
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,390
Next.

939
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,308
Next.

940
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,782
What are you doing?

941
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,662
I'm looking for a shooting star.

942
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,123
Why are you looking for a shooting star?

943
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,292
To make a wish upon it.

944
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,711
What wish?

945
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,257
I just

946
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,678
want someone to like me.

947
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,019
I should make a wish myself.

948
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,773
What are you wishing for?

949
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:30,942
I…

950
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,113
want to be 21 again.

951
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,532
Why?

952
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,368
Back then, I was so young

953
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,997
that I only valued
things that were new and shiny.

954
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:50,003
When what really mattered
was the person staying right by my side.

955
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,172
People are foolish.

956
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,675
We realize the value of things
only after losing them.

957
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,263
If only I could go back,

958
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,934
I would like to make things right.

959
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,117
What…

960
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,870
What the heck, Ok-hui?

961
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,205
What are you doing?

962
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,166
I can't sleep. Let me borrow your pillow.

963
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,209
Use your own pillow.

964
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,046
I need the pillow of someone
who sleeps well without any worry.

965
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,050
Hey!

966
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,426
Turn the light off!

967
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,143
Bae Ok-hui.

968
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,314
Look at what you're doing
just because of a guy.

969
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,984
Just stop liking him.

970
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,029
Easy.

971
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,420
-What the…
-The way this talisman works

972
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,131
is that it'll bring bad luck
to whatever they do.

973
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,845
Oh, my gosh! No!

974
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,171
If you are my destiny…

975
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,967
I will gladly cast myself
into fate's arms.

976
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,594
Do you speak French?

977
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,805
I'm a French teacher.

978
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,848
Sis.

979
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,937
What is your French name?

980
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:17,400
Sébastien Wernerbe
Berber Caburiels Stravos.

981
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:23,197
One talisman
can bring anyone into your life.

982
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,835
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

983
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,837
KIM MI-JIN, AGE 44, SPECIAL LARCENY
KANG SI-HU, AGE 38, 7 ASSAULT CONVICTIONS

984
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,300
Am I losing my hair?

985
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,385
I am.

986
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,845
It looks bare up there.

987
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,598
I think we're done with most crooks now.

988
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,142
Is there a way to speed things up?

989
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,481
Why is it so noisy here today?

990
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,733
The village is holding a rite.

991
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,151
A rite?

992
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,945
All right, that's great.

993
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,863
Follow me.

994
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:41,275
As there are no rootless trees,

995
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,529
there are no descendants
without ancestors.

996
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:48,157
We pray to General MacArthur

997
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,953
to help the mighty spirits
who look after this village

998
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,832
drive out all of the negative energy!

999
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,891
It's good to see you again, Father.

1000
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:16,894
You…

1001
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,105
How dare you come here?

1002
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,189
Father.

1003
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:21,858
Hey!

1004
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,194
The old man's still got his temper.

1005
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,238
Why would you come here?

1006
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,325
I'm going to work things out
with Hyeon-ok again.

1007
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,672
What a nice day for touching butts.

1008
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,048
I know.

1009
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,762
Now, shall we begin?

1010
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,475
Don't be selfish.

1011
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,983
Hey, Mr. Tenant.

1012
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,695
I saw that you drove nails into the wall.

1013
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:10,489
Don't do that again, okay?
It'll ruin the walls.

1014
01:05:15,953 --> 01:05:17,038
What was that?

1015
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,557
Go ahead and touch them.

1016
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,390
-Jang-yeol.
-Jang-yeol.

1017
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,105
Jang-yeol, it hurts.

1018
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:29,735
It hurts so much.

1019
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,128
I'm cold.

1020
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,425
Get me out of here.

1021
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,394
-The person…
-The person…

1022
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,564
-who killed me…
-who killed me…

1023
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,698
-The person who killed me…
-The person who killed me…

1024
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,492
-is here.
-is here.

1025
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:25,392
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

1026
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,229
Mr. Kim, I think I got my powers back.

1027
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:32,233
I think there's going to be
another big incident soon.

1028
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,401
A power outage?

1029
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,153
Oh, my gosh!

1030
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,031
You can see everything, right?

1031
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:39,949
Seon-woo.

1032
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,242
Where are you going?

1033
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,619
I got myself a workshop.

1034
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:46,455
What are you going to do
if he turns out to be the serial killer?

1035
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,791
We need to catch him quick
or else you'll be in more danger.

1036
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:51,252
Gwang-sik lied.

1037
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,587
Gwang-sik's actually psychic too.

1038
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:54,505
What?

1039
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,467
Where are you?

1040
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,347
Dr. Bong, did you follow me here?

1041
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:09,937
