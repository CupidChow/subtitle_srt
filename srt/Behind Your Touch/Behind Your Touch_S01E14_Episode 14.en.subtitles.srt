00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,041
What if the killer
isn't the third psychic?

3
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,668
No, what if there is no third psychic?

4
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,088
What? Explain so I can understand.

5
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,966
What if

6
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,011
everything Gwang-sik said was a lie?

7
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,473
What if there are only two psychics

8
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,558
and that silhouette never existed?

9
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:45,188
What if everything we've done so far
was dictated by what Gwang-sik told us?

10
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,775
And the silhouette was over there,
behind that pillar away from the shed.

11
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,109
He reached about here.

12
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,071
Yes, he seemed to reach about here,
so he's average in height.

13
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:54,948
-It means…
-He was the one

14
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,159
who saw the silhouette
and estimated the killer's height.

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,703
By doing so, he cleverly got himself
off the suspect list.

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,915
He does seem similar
to the silhouette I saw.

17
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,126
He was also the one
who accused Kim Seon-woo…

18
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,419
I saw the shaman with a knife in his hand…

19
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,380
…and the shaman of being the killer.

20
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm certain of it.

21
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,510
What if

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,804
we've been played by him

23
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,889
this whole time?

24
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,564
You wait here.

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,274
If anything happens, honk the horn.

26
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,792
Detective Moon.

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,171
What brings you here at this hour?

28
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,923
Is Gwang-sik home?

29
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,217
He went out just a while ago.

30
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,428
Do you know where he went?

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,180
He just said
he was stepping out for a bit.

32
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,600
Did something happen to him?

33
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
Get out of the car.

34
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,195
Sorry?

35
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,780
Get inside and stay put.

36
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,699
Don't cause any trouble.

37
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,826
What about you?

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,494
I have to find Jeon Gwang-sik.

39
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,706
It's dangerous. Let me come with you.

40
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,500
It'll be even more dangerous
if you come with me,

41
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,044
so just stay home.

42
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,135
Ask Ok-hui to stay with you or something.

43
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,055
You're worried about me, aren't you?

44
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,725
But it feels too awkward
to talk to me nicely,

45
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,186
so you're being curt and rude on purpose.

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,481
Stay with Ok-hui.

47
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,470
Detective Bae.

48
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
Track Jeon Gwang-sik's location for me.

49
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,850
Track Gwang-sik? Why?

50
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,103
I think he might be the killer.

51
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,104
What?

52
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,734
Call me when you have his location.

53
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,866
Excuse me.

54
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,939
You're clearly not Jeon Gwang-sik.

55
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,610
Did you kill him too?

56
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,328
You bastard.

57
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,418
GENERAL MACARTHUR TV

58
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,974
Are you all right?

59
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,436
You're making me
suspect you all over again.

60
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,147
Again with that nonsense?

61
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,795
Gwang-sik is the killer?

62
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,091
I got chills.

63
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,273
Dr. Bong.

64
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,944
Who…

65
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,070
Who's there?

66
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,863
I…

67
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,908
figured it out.

68
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,289
Gwang-sik!

69
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,457
Are you all right?

70
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,667
Gwang-sik!

71
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,460
Ok-hui, call an ambulance!

72
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,587
Gwang-sik, are you all right? Gwang-sik!

73
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,634
-Don't try to talk, Gwang-sik!
-This is Bong's Hospital.

74
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,261
This is Bong's Animal Hospital.

75
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,055
A man is bleeding here.
Please come quickly!

76
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,891
Yes?

77
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,269
What?

78
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,398
Black…

79
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,651
What?

80
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,410
Gwang-sik!

81
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,579
No, Gwang-sik!

82
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,999
Why do you have blood on your hand?

83
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,333
Blood?

84
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:55,970
I don't know.

85
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,972
I'm not sure why.

86
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,570
What are you doing?

87
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,742
-Where's the weapon?
-Weapon?

88
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,827
Stop playing dumb.

89
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,371
What are you talking about?

90
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,048
Hey, Bong Ye-bun.

91
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,176
What?

92
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,769
If you take even one step,

93
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,481
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,546
Detective, what do we do?

95
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,596
Is he dead?

96
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,349
Kim Seon-woo, that bastard!

97
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,266
What?

98
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,361
What brings you here, Detective?

99
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,612
Where's Kim Seon-woo?

100
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,530
Mr. Kim?

101
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,323
He's in the bathroom.

102
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,703
You bastard.

103
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,208
It was you, wasn't it?
You killed Gwang-sik.

104
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,087
Detective, stop!

105
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,881
Let go of me. This prick is the killer!

106
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,927
Do you still think I'm the murderer?

107
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,889
Dr. Bong already checked me.

108
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,517
Dr. Bong,

109
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,894
am I the killer?

110
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,814
Did you see anything
that made you suspect me?

111
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,484
No, I didn't.

112
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,032
Then let's look at the evidence.

113
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,412
You do have evidence, right?

114
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,717
What are you doing?

115
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,969
I'm looking for evidence.

116
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:44,555
What's wrong? Are you scared or something?

117
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,557
You got a search warrant?

118
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,271
On what grounds are you searching my room
without a warrant?

119
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,984
I won't take this anymore, damn it.

120
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,613
Watch your language.

121
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,910
I'm going to catch you. Just you wait.

122
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,712
-Please calm down.
-It's nothing serious.

123
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:17,796
Don't worry.

124
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,883
KOREA CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

125
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,565
Gwang-sik…

126
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,277
Gwang-sik!

127
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,949
Gwang-sik…

128
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,956
Where's Dr. Bong?

129
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,832
The Major Crimes Division
needed her testimony

130
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,584
because she discovered him first.

131
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,724
It seemed like he hadn't slept
properly in days.

132
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,644
Do you know why he left the house today?

133
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,695
Something seemed to be
weighing on his mind.

134
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,114
Then he left home
saying he had to check something.

135
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,699
Check something?

136
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,221
What if Gwang-sik figured something out…

137
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,103
I'm going to go check on something.

138
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,195
…and he was checking it out to make sure?

139
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,746
The killer was someone he knew.

140
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,083
What if he followed the killer
to use psychometry on him,

141
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,210
but it ended up
being the other way around?

142
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,717
Is that why he was killed?

143
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,724
But…

144
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,477
why did he drag himself
all the way here as he was dying?

145
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,530
Was there something
he wanted to tell Bong Ye-bun?

146
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,444
Gwang-sik told me something

147
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,863
before he died.

148
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,659
I didn't know what he meant at first.

149
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,953
Dr. Bong.

150
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,246
I…

151
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,040
figured it out.

152
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,168
Black…

153
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,465
Black?

154
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,135
The blackouts?

155
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,642
I think Gwang-sik figured out
who the killer was.

156
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,227
What?

157
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,187
He must have tried to confirm it himself.

158
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,358
My guess is that he saw blackouts
among the killer's memories,

159
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,277
which gave him a clue.

160
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,240
He must have seen something
the killer wanted to keep a secret,

161
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,909
which pushed the culprit to kill him.

162
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,289
Because Gwang-sik found something on him.

163
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,584
He probably came to tell you

164
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,380
that the blackouts contain a clue
that can help catch the killer.

165
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:33,510
But aren't the blackouts created
simply by closing your eyes?

166
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,180
Could there be more to it?

167
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,390
Maybe there's a trick.

168
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,350
A trick?

169
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,771
I did think something was off.

170
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,523
You may be able to stab a victim
with your eyes closed,

171
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,736
but how could you approach the victim
without seeing where you're going?

172
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,749
I tested it out,

173
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,337
and it's impossible to reach the victim
with your eyes closed.

174
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,547
Then…

175
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,926
were his eyes
only half-closed or something?

176
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,971
But I didn't see any gaps
in the blackouts that I saw.

177
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,099
They were completely black.

178
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,811
There's probably a trick
to create blackouts

179
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
even with your eyes open.

180
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,940
But what could that be?

181
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,741
You want me…

182
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,953
to touch Seon-woo's butt

183
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,039
and find that out, don't you?

184
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,836
I'm still suspicious of him.

185
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,089
The guy in the rain poncho
disappeared near his place.

186
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,258
And he had blood on his hand.

187
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,261
Then…

188
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,888
Don't touch him.

189
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,474
What?

190
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,061
Gwang-sik died trying to check things.

191
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,231
Isn't that all the more reason

192
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,567
for me to figure out the blackout trick?

193
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,611
You can stay with me to protect me.

194
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,073
We still don't know anything
about the blackouts.

195
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,367
Touching him won't solve anything.

196
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,119
So don't touch him.

197
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,496
There has to be another way.

198
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,625
For now,

199
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,212
make sure to keep away from Kim Seon-woo.

200
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,258
Okay?

201
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,650
We still don't know anything
about the blackouts.

202
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,944
Touching him won't solve anything.

203
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,993
But I have to touch him
if I want to get any information.

204
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,164
He's probably not the killer anyway.

205
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,224
DR. BONG

206
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,493
Dr. Bong.

207
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,210
Detective Moon…

208
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,880
He's only like that
because he wants to catch the killer.

209
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,176
I hope you don't resent him too much.

210
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,766
Do you think so too?

211
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,644
Do you think I'm the killer?

212
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,235
Then touch me.

213
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,908
I don't care what anyone else thinks,

214
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,535
but I can't stand

215
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,412
you suspecting me too.

216
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,715
I don't need to touch you.

217
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,428
I believe you.

218
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,014
You're not the killer.

219
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,567
Kim Seon-woo
is with Bong Ye-bun right now.

220
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,568
What?

221
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,527
Where?

222
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,698
You can't leave them alone together.

223
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,576
Keep an eye on Kim Seon-woo.
See if he does anything fishy.

224
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,123
So the two of them are together right now?

225
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,002
Then I guess Dr. Bong
doesn't think he's the killer.

226
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,922
She didn't see anything unusual
except the blackouts when she touched him.

227
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,801
The answer definitely lies
in the blackouts.

228
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,389
Are you saying you can't kill someone
with your eyes closed?

229
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,974
That's not it.

230
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,060
You can stab someone
with your eyes closed,

231
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,980
but how can you find your way
to your target when you can't see?

232
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,025
If you know exactly where your target is

233
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,987
and know the location inside out,

234
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,156
it would be possible, no?

235
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,783
That wouldn't be enough.

236
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:51,369
I couldn't do it when I tested it out
on my rooftop with a sandbag.

237
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,540
But maybe it's possible
to approach a moving target

238
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,626
by sensing their movements.

239
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,797
I want to test that theory out.

240
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,176
You and Gwang-sik were pretty close.

241
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,637
You must be devastated.

242
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,599
He was also psychic

243
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,103
just like me.

244
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,898
That brought us close.

245
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,152
And we both helped Detective Moon
with his investigation.

246
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,658
So there was someone else
who was psychic besides you?

247
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:31,868
Yes.

248
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,666
Gwang-sik could perform psychometry
by touching the legs.

249
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,339
But…

250
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,676
the serial killer is psychic too.

251
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,223
The killer is psychic?

252
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,392
Yes.

253
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,773
Which part of the body
does the killer have to touch?

254
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,650
I don't know.

255
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,778
On the night of the meteor shower,

256
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,407
the killer was standing
far away from the cow.

257
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,663
Then you don't know
exactly what kind of power he has?

258
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,332
That's right.

259
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,223
This is my place,

260
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,726
so I know where everything is inside out.

261
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,644
Okay, we're ready.

262
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,897
-Detective Bae, turn off the lights.
-Yes, sir.

263
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,106
Why turn off the lights?

264
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,026
I want to experiment
under the same conditions as the killer.

265
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,029
He only murdered people
in dark places with his eyes closed.

266
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,697
You have a point.

267
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,449
-Turn off the lights.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,327
All right.

269
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,661
Get started.

270
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,623
My target is Detective Bae.

271
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,500
I'll try to react to his movements.

272
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,309
It's me.

273
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:23,980
Let's try again.

274
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,614
It's me again.

275
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:37,452
Again.

276
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,419
Are you sure you weren't targeting me?

277
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,922
No, I was targeting Detective Bae.

278
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,050
No. You definitely hold
a grudge against me.

279
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,885
That's not what's important right now.

280
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,345
It's very important to me.

281
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,888
As Detective Moon said,

282
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,976
it seems impossible to approach
your target with your eyes closed,

283
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,021
even if you're familiar with the location
and can sense the target's movements.

284
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,611
AUTOPSY ROOM

285
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,074
Captain, I have a favor to ask you.

286
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,952
Could you go and take a look at Gwang-sik?

287
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,789
You know we don't have the authority
to investigate this case anymore.

288
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,667
How can I take a look at a body
that's prepped for an autopsy?

289
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,795
That's why I'm asking you.

290
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,173
I bet his body has different stab wounds
from the other victims.

291
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,301
Please.

292
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,912
How did he know about this
without even seeing the body?

293
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,416
It's just like you said.

294
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,753
Gwang-sik's stab wounds
are definitely different

295
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,588
when compared with the first victim.

296
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,593
The first victim, Kim Si-a,
was stabbed randomly.

297
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,511
So was Seung-gil.

298
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,890
It was as if the killer
had never stabbed anyone before

299
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,476
and didn't know
where the vital points were.

300
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,979
In Lee Ji-suk's case,
he even used a cable tie on her wrist.

301
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,567
He was using a tool to make up for
having to keep his eyes closed.

302
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,778
Until this point,

303
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,946
I thought he was stabbing
with his eyes closed.

304
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,409
But look at Assemblyman Cha.

305
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,207
He's gotten less sloppy
and a lot more precise.

306
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,917
He evolved.

307
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,211
Most importantly,

308
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,880
he stabbed Dr. Jung
precisely in one of the vital points

309
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,382
to make it seem like a suicide.

310
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,635
That would have been impossible
if his eyes were closed.

311
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,306
The minute I heard
that Gwang-sik mentioned the blackouts,

312
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,808
I knew that his stab wounds

313
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,185
would be different
from the previous victims'.

314
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,689
Gwang-sik was stabbed
right in the vital point.

315
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,943
So the killer stabbed him
with his eyes open?

316
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,653
Most likely.

317
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:21,324
Gwang-sik figured out how the killer
created blackouts with his eyes open.

318
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:25,203
Our goal from now on
is to find out what that trick is.

319
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,704
Right.

320
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,211
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

321
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,539
I feel so bad for poor Ae-ran.

322
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,791
I feel even worse for Gwang-sik.

323
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,087
I heard that Hwang, the cabbage farmer,

324
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,090
was questioned
at the police station this morning.

325
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,843
Why would they question such a nice man?

326
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,555
He had a pretty big argument
with Gwang-sik over the cabbage prices

327
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,600
during the kimchi-making season last year.

328
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,601
Yeah?

329
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:34,355
The police seem to believe
that he could've held a grudge.

330
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,690
-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

331
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,235
They'll have to investigate
the whole neighborhood then.

332
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,738
It's a complete mess.

333
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,782
What do we do?

334
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,700
It's just unbelievable.

335
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,162
GENERAL MACARTHUR

336
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,711
I guess the Major Crimes Division
suspects him as well.

337
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,671
He'll be released soon.

338
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,883
They have no justification or excuse
to hold him for long.

339
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,190
This kid

340
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,609
is you, right?

341
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,569
Yes, it is.

342
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,113
Then you must have had
something against Assemblyman Cha

343
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,950
due to the Mujin redevelopment incident.

344
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:33,581
There are a lot of people in Mujin
who held a grudge against him.

345
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,918
I'm only one of them.

346
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,338
There has been another murder.

347
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,425
We're just investigating
everyone connected to the victims,

348
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,718
including Mr. Jeon.

349
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,178
So please cooperate.

350
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,474
And here.

351
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,520
We have a search warrant.

352
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,405
Look in there as well.

353
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,781
Over here.

354
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,534
Excuse me. That's mine, not Mr. Kim's.

355
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,582
That's General MacArthur's.

356
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,876
They couldn't find anything.

357
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,754
Perhaps he already disposed of the weapon.

358
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,424
No, the murder weapon
should still be in the house.

359
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,428
He had no time to hide it anywhere else
because he ran into me last night.

360
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,221
He could have thrown it out at daybreak.

361
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,017
I watched him all night,
and he didn't leave his house.

362
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,769
Then what's going on here?

363
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,688
The Major Crimes Division
couldn't find the weapon,

364
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,024
but it's still somewhere in the house?

365
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,736
He wouldn't have hidden the weapon
where it could be easily discovered.

366
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,032
He would've hidden it
in a place only he knows.

367
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,076
We need to monitor him more closely.

368
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,538
We don't know when or how
he'll try to dispose of the weapon.

369
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,720
Why do you keep cleaning the same spot?

370
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,056
I have a lot on my mind.

371
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,559
Should we close the hospital early?

372
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,269
We have no patients anyway.

373
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,022
No, I think it's best to keep myself busy.

374
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,622
I have to go to my workshop

375
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,874
to work on an order.

376
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,876
Could you come with me

377
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,713
if it's not too much to ask?

378
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,882
You want me to come with you?

379
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,637
I need company
if I want to avoid suspicion.

380
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,516
You need an alibi.

381
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,309
I'm sorry.

382
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,479
I don't want to use you like this,

383
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,107
but the only person I trust…

384
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,900
No.

385
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,362
The only person
who trusts me right now is you.

386
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,242
Okay.

387
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,577
I'll go with you.

388
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,134
Typical Bong Ye-bun.

389
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,845
How can she be so reckless?

390
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,302
Now we need to use finer sandpaper.

391
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,765
See this here?

392
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,270
At the final stage, you need to use
the 320 or 400-grit sandpaper.

393
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,649
I didn't know there were
so many types of sandpaper.

394
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,905
When sanding something,

395
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,951
you need to hold it like this
and secure your wrist.

396
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,285
Like this.

397
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,215
Sorry.

398
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,177
I just wanted to demonstrate.
Sorry for startling you.

399
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,847
Not at all.

400
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm getting the hang of it
now that you've demonstrated it for me.

401
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,274
NUTJOB

402
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,535
NUTJOB

403
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,996
You should answer it.

404
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,247
It seems urgent.

405
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,461
Then excuse me for a second.

406
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,969
What do you want?

407
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,641
What is this?

408
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,310
Did you tail Seon-woo?

409
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,312
I already told you it's not him.

410
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,105
I'm here for you, not him.

411
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,317
I was worried about you.

412
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,529
Dr. Bong?

413
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
Worried, my foot.

414
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,299
Stop with the nonsense and leave.

415
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,759
Why did you hide?

416
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,929
Is it because you don't want to upset him?

417
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,557
Do you like him that much?

418
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,268
Or do you just need someone to date?

419
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,520
What?

420
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,981
In that case, you can date me.

421
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,942
I'll go out with you.

422
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,322
You're a real jerk, you know that?

423
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,423
Where were you? I didn't see you outside.

424
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,969
I took a little walk
while talking on the phone.

425
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:45,930
Let me.

426
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,495
It's chilly in here.

427
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,505
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

428
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,342
Thank you for today.

429
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,678
Take care on your way home.

430
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,535
You wanted to see me, sir?

431
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,205
You.

432
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,918
I told you to stop investigating
the serial killing, did I not?

433
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,712
Yes, you did.

434
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,630
So I've washed my hands of it.

435
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,636
Then who's this?

436
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,930
Your twin brother?

437
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,975
AUTOPSY ROOM

438
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,440
It's me.

439
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,324
Chief.

440
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,411
Let's forget about
the Major Crimes Division

441
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,996
and other things for a second.

442
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,123
We're all detectives, aren't we?

443
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,960
I think it's a detective's duty
to catch a culprit.

444
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,840
Our fellow villager,
who was alive and well until yesterday

445
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,258
is now dead.

446
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,052
So how can I sit back and do nothing?

447
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,638
I can't do that.

448
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,975
Let me disobey you this once

449
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,603
and keep investigating…

450
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,564
the serial killing.

451
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,291
What are you doing?

452
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,794
We've been tipped off
that a gambling ring will show up

453
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,130
at the Gyeongsan Soybean Festival.

454
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,133
We have to go and patrol there
until the festival ends.

455
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,760
We just had another murder.

456
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,887
Our town is in bigger danger.

457
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,014
Do you not get it?

458
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,892
The chief is sending us there
so we don't humiliate him

459
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,686
in front of the Major Crimes Division

460
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,355
by trying to interfere
with the investigation.

461
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,734
I'm staying here to keep a watch
on Kim Seon-woo so you all can go.

462
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,403
Look here.

463
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,073
The chief will be there in person.

464
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:55,119
Let's lay low there for a few days
and resume our investigation

465
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,579
once we get back.

466
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,291
It'll be a tactical withdrawal.

467
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,584
No.

468
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,337
Take a look at these guys.

469
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,674
Are you going to get them fired?

470
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,520
Then let's at least prepare
for our absence before we go.

471
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,452
Am I flying?

472
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,539
What are you doing?

473
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,208
What's happening?

474
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,046
What's this about?

475
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,176
Answer the following questions
carefully, okay?

476
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,389
Was there anything suspicious
about Kim Seon-woo during his stay?

477
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,725
I'm not sure.

478
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,477
Any strange objects at home?

479
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,688
I don't know.

480
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,857
Any signs that he's hiding something?

481
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,027
Not really.

482
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,862
Who's the skank my husband is seeing?

483
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,906
What?

484
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,577
I'm sorry.

485
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,079
I didn't sleep well last night.

486
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,919
There's something
we need you to do for us.

487
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:32,132
Watch Kim Seon-woo's every move
and report back to us.

488
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,468
In particular,

489
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,764
the weapon he used to kill Gwang-sik
would still be in the house.

490
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,021
You know this knife, right?

491
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,022
Try to look for it.

492
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,401
I can't do that. I'm scared.

493
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,154
You speak to spirits all the time.
How could this be scary for you?

494
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,992
Spirits at least make me money.
Murderers are just scary.

495
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,327
I can't do it.

496
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,663
What are you doing?

497
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,625
You said we needed to go somewhere!
Why are we here?

498
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,460
Seriously, what are you doing?

499
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,629
When you commit a crime, you do time.

500
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,881
What's my crime?

501
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,174
Obstruction of justice.

502
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,136
When did I ever do that?

503
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,513
You kept following me around

504
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,890
and interfering
with the serial killer investigation.

505
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,767
Going on about psychics and butts.

506
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,769
Are you serious?

507
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,354
Let me go right now!

508
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,565
This is a clear abuse of authority!

509
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,358
I'm trying to save you.

510
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
I know you, and this is the only way.

511
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,656
Why do you think
Seon-woo will try to kill me?

512
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,367
You'll be in danger,
no matter who the killer is.

513
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,705
The killer got rid of Gwang-sik
because he was getting in his way.

514
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,040
You're no exception.

515
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,835
You're the only person
who can figure out his blackout trick.

516
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,587
You need to be alive to catch the killer.

517
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,257
Still, you can't do this!

518
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,680
What are you doing?

519
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,015
Give that back!

520
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,099
SEON-WOO

521
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,353
This is the safest place
for you right now.

522
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,312
So be patient.

523
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,024
I'm going to question her myself tomorrow.

524
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,859
Don't let her out no matter what.

525
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,069
Yes, sir.

526
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,612
Wait. Detective!

527
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,572
Detective!

528
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,240
You can't leave me here like this!

529
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,117
Come on!

530
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,254
They're waiting for us in Gyeongsan.

531
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,381
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

532
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,341
Do you think we're going on a picnic?

533
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,051
I didn't have breakfast.

534
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,135
Let's get going.

535
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,909
Have you looked for the weapon?

536
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,610
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here.

537
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,404
It's okay.

538
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,704
Sorry. I'll close the door.

539
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,748
Yeah.

540
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,871
Why don't you use a paring knife?

541
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,585
This works better.

542
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,091
Would you like

543
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,385
some apple?

544
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:09,803
No, thank you.

545
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,388
You go ahead.

546
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,043
Excuse me! Detective Kang!

547
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,295
Detective Kang!

548
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,630
Wait.

549
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,340
Over here.

550
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,763
Why are you in there?

551
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,017
I have something I didn't tell you before.

552
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,439
What is it that you didn't tell me?

553
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,860
There's something

554
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,947
that Gwang-sik told me before he died.

555
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:12,991
What is it?

556
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,911
"Black."

557
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:17,996
Excuse me?

558
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,207
He meant the blackouts.

559
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,002
The truth is,

560
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,088
there are psychics in Mujin.

561
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,299
I thought Gwang-sik and I
were the only ones

562
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,468
and suspected he was the killer,

563
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,553
but then he was murdered.

564
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,183
So that means
there were three psychics, not two.

565
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,271
But now there are two left,

566
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,481
me and the killer.

567
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,193
And I might be the killer's next target.

568
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:54,032
We need to figure out
the blackout trick to catch the killer.

569
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,492
Officer Kim, are you there?

570
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,285
It's true. Please believe me.

571
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,578
Let me touch your butt.

572
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,579
My what?

573
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,289
I'll prove that I'm psychic.

574
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,375
So let me just touch your butt.

575
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,377
What are you… Officer Kim, get in here!

576
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,420
Just once…

577
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,421
Sir.

578
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,464
Ask her family to pick her up.

579
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,549
Yes, sir.

580
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,598
What was that all about?

581
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,684
"Make sure she stays put
and takes her meds on time"?

582
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,352
It's nothing.

583
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:27,941
MISSED CALLS FROM SEON-WOO

584
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,612
SEON-WOO

585
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:33,947
Who is it?

586
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,949
Hi, Seon-woo.

587
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:38,910
Right now?

588
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:40,620
You can't!

589
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,205
Yes, I'm free now.

590
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,874
Are you crazy?

591
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,208
Okay, I'll be right there.

592
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,711
You're really going to see Seon-woo?

593
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:50,172
That little…

594
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,596
Hi, Bong Ye-bun was just released

595
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,139
and is off to meet Kim Seon-woo.

596
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,516
What is it? What's going on?

597
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,518
Captain, I…

598
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,395
I have to go back to Mujin right now.

599
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,439
Did you not hear what I said?

600
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,690
We're going to get fired.

601
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:10,484
Bong Ye-bun's in danger.

602
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,236
Like, actual danger?

603
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,323
She could be in danger.

604
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:21,453
Are you worried about her
as a detective or a man?

605
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,207
Both.

606
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,503
Okay.

607
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,587
Then you should go.

608
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,465
Will you be okay?

609
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,302
I doubt we'll really get fired,
although our pay might get cut.

610
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,348
Sure, paychecks are a huge deal for us.

611
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:45,393
But you're doing this
for something bigger than that.

612
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,356
Go.

613
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,724
Hi, Seon-woo.

614
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,986
I thought you'd come alone.

615
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,989
I met Mr. Park out front.

616
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,825
The neighborhood is dangerous these days.

617
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,536
I saw Dr. Bong
walking all alone in the dark,

618
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,788
so I thought I'd escort her here.

619
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,583
I see.

620
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,670
And I wanted to see you too.

621
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,615
Thank you.

622
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,037
-Are you all right?
-I'm sorry.

623
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,747
-Oh, no.
-You should go to the bathroom.

624
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,415
There's one in the church.

625
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,292
I'm okay.

626
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,421
You might have gotten burned.
You should go.

627
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:44,012
I don't know where the church bathroom is.

628
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,932
Could you walk me to the entrance?

629
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,517
Then…

630
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,686
I'll be right back.

631
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,812
Okay.

632
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,051
It's to your right once you go inside.

633
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:25,470
I'll leave you here then.

634
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,807
Come with me, Mr. Kim.

635
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,058
I'm scared.

636
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,071
It was Seon-woo?

637
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:43,757
Dr. Bong!

638
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,244
What's going on?

639
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,669
Seon-woo!

640
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,136
Run!

641
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,054
Seon-woo!

642
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,931
Run! Hurry!

643
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,692
Please help me.

644
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,652
The serial killer is here.

645
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,064
The only person I trust…

646
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,023
No.

647
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,151
The only person
who trusts me right now is you.

648
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,110
Run!

649
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,028
Run! Hurry!

650
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,463
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

651
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,298
Seon-woo's dead.

652
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:38,009
What are you going to do?

653
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,596
It'll be painful as I'm reminded of this
for the rest of my life.

654
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,474
I should never have helped you
from the very beginning.

655
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,518
Please don't come back here ever again.

656
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,395
What are you…

657
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:51,564
I'll catch him on my own.

658
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,690
Jang-yeol!

659
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,275
We need to catch the serial killer.

660
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,402
Bong Ye-bun, I figured it out.

661
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,779
I figured out the blackout trick.

662
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,696
I don't care.

663
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,783
I was happier
when I didn't have this lousy power.

664
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,243
You're the only witness

665
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,205
who's met the killer twice.

666
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,373
Bong Ye-bun!

667
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:14,337
