00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,068
Mr. Park.

3
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,467
Ye-bun, you said you'd be coming.
Are you here yet?

4
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,727
I don't think I can come today.

5
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,770
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,824
Can I ask you

7
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,034
why you were there?

8
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,955
I was there

9
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,875
to kill Cha Ju-man.

10
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,376
What?

11
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,712
He…

12
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,382
deserves to suffer the wrath of the gods.

13
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,970
But no matter how hard I prayed,

14
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,598
nothing bad ever happened to him.

15
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,935
Those who deserve to die live
while those who deserve to live die.

16
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,604
Cha Ju-man…

17
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,982
deserves to die.

18
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,903
Take a good look around.

19
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,197
This 20,000 pyeong of land here in Sua-ri
is worth around 10,000 won per pyeong.

20
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
So why am I recommending this land to you?

21
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:25,079
Because this area is highly likely
to be redeveloped into the Mujin New Town.

22
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,791
-If this is confirmed…
-My father lived in poverty all his life.

23
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,002
So those words really hit him.

24
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,255
That his children would
no longer have to live in poverty.

25
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,590
If you trust me and do as I say…

26
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,552
INVESTIGATE THE REAL ESTATE FRAUDS!

27
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,391
You bastard.

28
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,435
You said that the land
would be redeveloped!

29
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,937
Give me back my money!

30
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,063
Cut the crap.

31
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,398
I never forced you to buy it.

32
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,318
It was your decision.
So why are you taking it out on me?

33
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
Get up.

34
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,363
Just go home.

35
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,240
This won't solve anything.

36
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,243
Please vote for Assemblyman
Yoon Deok-hyeon, okay?

37
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,001
Dad! I'm home!

38
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,468
Dad!

39
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,637
Dad, what happened? Dad!

40
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,058
-Mom.
-My mother

41
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,143
also lived her whole life in poverty

42
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,898
until she passed away after my father.

43
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,615
I wanted to punish him with my own hands.

44
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,786
Cha Ju-man that bastard,
is living in comfort as an assemblyman

45
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,038
despite the terrible things that he did.

46
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,083
All the while,

47
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:58,089
we've been suffering for generations.

MUJIN REDEVELOPMENT SCANDAL,
YOON DEOK-HYEON'S CONFIDANT TESTIFIES

65
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,995
CONFIDANT

66
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,456
A confidant…

67
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,634
Hello, Mr. Bae.

68
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,594
Hi, Ye-bun.

69
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,596
Ok-hui should be at the store right now.

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,515
I actually came to see you.

71
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:13,975
Me?

72
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,103
Do you remember the mess
created by rumors about redevelopment

73
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,439
and special tourist zones
over ten years ago?

74
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,398
Goodness gracious.

75
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:24,068
A "mess" would be an understatement.
It was absolute chaos.

76
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,529
There wasn't a single person
who didn't lose money.

77
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,449
I heard Assemblyman Yoon Deok-hyeon

78
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,367
had a hand in the redevelopment issue.

79
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,787
That was the rumor.

80
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,247
But there was no evidence,

81
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,500
and no one stepped up
and testified against him.

82
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,043
What?

83
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,920
No one testified against him?

84
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,798
But I read that a confidant of his

85
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,384
was going to testify in court.

86
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,803
That's what the newspapers said,

87
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,889
but no one actually showed up.

88
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,309
That's why Yoon Deok-hyeon
was able to serve numerous terms

89
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,519
and even became a government minister.

90
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,024
Wasn't Mr. Cha his aide at the time?

91
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,358
That's right.

92
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,904
He was at Yoon Deok-hyeon's beck and call.

93
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,283
Like a confidant?

94
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,076
Yes, definitely.

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,207
That's why he inherited
this region from him.

96
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,596
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT
I'LL BE A FAITHFUL SERVANT

97
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,981

What are you staring at?

102
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,203
No matter how much I think about it,

103
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,373
the victims seem to have
nothing in common.

104
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,916
They're different genders too.

105
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,752
We don't even know
the motive for the murders.

106
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
We have nothing to go on.

107
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,672
I'm starting to believe

108
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,299
he's just a psychopath
who gets a kick out of killing.

109
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,762
It's been a while since the third murder.

110
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm getting anxious.

111
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,226
He may make another attempt sometime soon.

112
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,814
It could be that he hasn't been able to.

113
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,274
What?

114
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,192
What do you mean?

115
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,988
The killer could already be on our radar.

116
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,139
-What are you doing?
-My gosh!

117
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,474
Why would you startle me like that?

118
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,602
You talk faster when you're startled.

119
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,353
What are you doing here?

120
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,022
Me? I'm investigating.

121
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,690
Investigating what?

122
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,235
What else? The serial killer case.

123
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,156
There's nothing here.

124
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,825
Run, don't walk.

125
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,411
Investigations are all about legwork.

126

GENERAL MACARTHUR TV

127
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,195
What the…

128
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,885
What are you doing?

129
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,887
I could ask you the same question.

130
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,055
What did I do?

131
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,473
Just come with me.

132
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,308
I'm your captain. Let go of me.

133
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,144
Why do we keep running into each other?

134
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,605
You're on to something, aren't you?

135
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,110
Looks like I'm not the only one.

136
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,029
Then let's share what we know.

137
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,119
Rock, paper, scissors.

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,626
Long ago, Assemblyman Yoon Deok-hyeon
carried out a redevelopment scheme

139
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,671
with Assemblyman Cha,
who was his aide at the time.

140
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,633
And the chairperson
of the emergency committee

141
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,260
vanished into thin air.

142
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,304
Kim Seon-woo is that chairperson's son.

143
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,809
So he moved to Mujin
because of Cha Ju-man.

144
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,437
Now tell me what you know.

145
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,274
Kim Seon-woo

146
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,985
seems to be connected to the murders.

147
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,528
What?

148
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,863
Are you sure?

149
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,573
How?

150
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,785
You must have some kind of proof.

151
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,913
Well, through psychome…

152
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,168
Do you

153
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,129
believe in aliens?

154
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,800
What about psychics?

155
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,473
Cut it out.

156
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,350
What's this nonsense
about aliens and psychics?

157
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,645
Police officers shouldn't believe
in such absurd things.

158
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,190
So what is this about?

159
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,358
How is Kim Seon-woo
connected to the murders?

160
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,819
It's just a gut feeling.

161
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,159
You're completely
off your rocker, aren't you?

162
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,160
Look here.

163
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,078
That's not a gut feeling.

164
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,207
You're just being paranoid.

165
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,084
So you just made me spill the beans.

166
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,567
What are you doing here?

167
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,950
I've committed a terrible sin.

168
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,662
I didn't know
how to cope with it on my own,

169
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,580
so I came to confess to a priest.

170
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,332
Unbelievable.

171
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,503
What is this neighborhood coming to?

172
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,797
A shaman visits a priest

173
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,466
while another dude goes on about psychics.

174
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,385
This whole town is going crazy.

175
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,304
Who went on about psychics?

176
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,431
You know, the guy who has a screw loose.

177
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,600
Detective Moon?

178
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,936
So you do get things right after all.

179
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,274
Why are you packing all of a sudden?

180
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,194
My spiritual master
lives in Mount Suraksan.

181
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,532
I want to offer some prayers
and pay her a visit for a couple of days.

182
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,118
What about Justin?

183
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,788
He's with someone
that could take care of him.

184
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,541
Take care while I'm away.

185
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,793
Have a good trip.

186
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,427
But…

187
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,095
Mr. Park.

188
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,439
Where are the frozen dumplings
that were in here?

189
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,359
Those were yours?

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,993
I knew these weren't my regular ramyeon.

191
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,755
Goodness.

192
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,674
-Detective Moon.
-Where are you going?

193
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,716
I'm…

194
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,842
Mr. Park!

195
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,969
Bye.

196
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,704
I know he holds a grudge
against Assemblyman Cha.

197
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,455
But what about the other victims?

198
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,624
I don't see any connection.

199
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,376
I don't know anymore.

200
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,257
What are you doing there?

201
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,344
I was waiting for you.

202
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,054
What?

203
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,017
You have access to old case files
since you're a detective, right?

204
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,228
Yes, as long as they still exist.

205
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,647
Then could you look into a case for me?

206
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,444
Sorry, but I don't have
time for that right now.

207
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,529
On November 13, 2005,

208
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,823
a car fell off the Mujin breakwater
into the sea.

209
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,867
The death was ruled as suicide.

210
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,871
I know you're busy,
but please look into this one.

211
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,873
The person who died was my mom.

212
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,318
Year 2005…

213
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,825
CASE FILES
YEAR: 2005

214
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,368
MUJIN PORT VEHICLE DROWNING CASE

215
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,041
MUJIN PORT VEHICLE DROWNING CASE

216
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,506
MUJIN PORT VEHICLE DROWNING CASE

217
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,009
"The autopsy report showed that sedatives
were found in the victim's body."

218
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,345
"As the concentration of the sedatives
is normal,

219
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,514
the cause of death
is presumed to be drowning."

220
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,640
"No signs of external trauma."

221
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,199
"Jung Mi-ok, who was in the driver's seat,

222
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,035
released the parking brake
and fixed the gear in neutral."

223
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,996
"She then took sleeping pills
while her foot was on the brakes."

224
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,043
"As the sleeping pills took effect,
her body relaxed,

225
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
which lifted her foot off the brakes."

226
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,757
"The car then slowly rolled down the slope
into the water."

227
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,928
"When the police recreated the scene,

228
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:02,057
the car rolled down the slope
three out of five times."

229
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,893
"But the car didn't move at all
in the remaining two cases."

230
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,159
The case is old,

231
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,119
and the scene has changed as well.

232
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,664
There were no CCTVs,
so I can't verify anything myself.

233
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,042
All I can base my judgment on

234
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,878
is the old case file.

235
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,964
But everything in the file lines up.

236
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,218
It could have been an accident.

237
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,096
From what I can tell,

238
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,056
my mom had no reason to kill herself.

239
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,810
So I want to know what made the police
conclude that it was suicide.

240
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:51,064
That was because of
Assemblyman Cha's testimony.

241
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:51,982
Mi-ok…

242
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,985
had been having a really hard time.

243
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,029
Her husband died young,

244
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,989
and she had fallen out with her father.

245
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,783
She must've been so lonely.

246
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,121
And it wasn't like she could talk about
her struggles with her daughter.

247
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,041
She often told me

248
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,877
that she wanted to give up on everything.

249
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,964
So I recommended a clinic for her,

250
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,384
and she began taking antidepressants.

251
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,889
Her mood seemed to improve,

252
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,392
so I thought things were okay now.

253
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,728
But I guess

254
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,814
things were still too tough for her.

255
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,944
And since there was an actual record
of her psychiatric treatment,

256
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,029
the case was concluded as a suicide.

257
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,449
So you're saying
that other possibilities were ruled out,

258
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,286
and her case was concluded as a suicide
because of Assemblyman Cha's testimony.

259
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,708
What would have happened
if not for his testimony?

260
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,546
Then the police would've kept digging,
considering other possibilities as well.

261
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,514
This place is really popular.

262
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,475
I'm telling you
I waited in line to buy this.

263
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,728
Hey, Ye-bun!

264
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,231
You came at the right time.

265
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,691
Come sit.

266
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,442
Have a seat.

267
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,408
You're very lucky. This is good food.

268
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,285
Do you know what this is?

269
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,371
This is traditional rotisserie chicken.

270
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,625
Back in the day, fathers would buy this
for their families on payday.

271
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,753
And what do you know?
They still sell this.

272
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,967
You remember this too, right?

273
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,343
Here, have some.

274
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,478
How's the hospital?

275
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,649
Some days are good,
and some days are not so good.

276
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,942
Don't you worry.

277
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,069
When Mujin gets redeveloped soon,

278
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,489
I'm going to build an apartment complex
right behind this hospital,

279
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,367
so you'll get more patients than ever.

280
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,036
I'll work super hard.

281
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,581
Thank you for looking out for us.

282
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,416
There's no need to thank me.

283
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,215
It's the anniversary
of Mi-ok's passing soon.

284
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,135
I'll come by that evening.

285
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,512
Okay.

286
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,264
Gosh.

287
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,183
Even after all these years,

288
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,771
I feel so down every year
around this time.

289
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh, right.

290
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,861
I wanted to ask you something, Ye-bun.

291
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,658
I hear you've been spending a lot of time
with Detective Moon.

292
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,415
Is there going to be good news soon?

293
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:57,959
It's not like that.

294
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,086
Come on.

295
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,298
Why else would you be
hanging around a detective then?

296
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,299
Am I wrong?

297
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,516
Eat up, Ju-man.

298
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,727
Do you want a drink?

299
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,147
Shall I bring some out?

300
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,609
There's no need.

301
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,695
I should get going.

302
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,742
Dr. Jung.

303
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,160
Yeah?

304
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,411
I'll get going now.

305
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,372
All right.

306
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,181
That bastard.

307
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,685
He's been fooling us
this whole time with that smile.

308
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,866
Get home safely.

309
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,249
VETERINARIAN LICENSE, MEMBER OF THE KVMA

310
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,375
Mi-ok…

311
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,380
should have listened to you
and have gone to veterinary school.

312
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,300
Am I right?

313
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,721
I guess it's a relief that Ye-bun
inherited your hospital at least.

314
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,183
She really does

315
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,894
take after Mi-ok.

316
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,146
Not only her looks

317
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,481
but also her personality.

318
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,818
So lively

319
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,029
and daring.

320
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,699
Mi-ok was exactly the same way.

321
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,997
And to think she broke your heart
by doing that to herself.

322
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,208
Don't you dare

323
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,793
talk about Mi-ok that way.

324
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,173
I'm sorry.

325
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,884
It just makes me sad to think about it.

326
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,471
She wouldn't have ended up like that

327
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,307
if I had paid more attention to her.

328
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,894
You bastard!

329
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,522
You know better than anyone

330
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,942
that Mi-ok didn't kill herself!

331
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,073
I do?

332
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,534
How would I know that?

333
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,082
I understand that
you'd want to believe so as her father.

334
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,375
But you see…

335
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,002
She did kill herself.

336
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,965
Mi-ok was under a lot of stress.

337
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,592
And you were a big part of that.

338
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,720
Why, you…

339
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,269
Don't do this.

340
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,813
You'll be punished harshly

341
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,524
if you do this to a government official.

342
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,324
Look at this dog.
It does its job better than my aide.

343
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,162
Arfie, what's wrong?

344
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,958
What happened, Father?

345
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,001
It's nothing.

346
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,503
It's suddenly throwing a tantrum.

347
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,631
Anyway, I'll get going now.

348
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,387
Father, are you all right?

349
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,935
Arfie.

350
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,354
It's okay. Calm down.

351
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,189
Come here.

352
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,442
It's okay.

353
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,570
What happened?

354
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,616
You bastard!

355
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,203
You know better than anyone
that Mi-ok didn't kill herself!

356
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,386
Mom didn't kill herself, did she?

357
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,143
And you think Mr. Cha
had something to do with it.

358
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:28,146
That's why you stayed by his side,
even though you hate his guts.

359
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,981
That's also why you stole the donor list.

360
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,275
I want to know.

361
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,403
You have to tell me why you think
he's connected to her death.

362
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,156
Don't concern yourself with this.

363
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,367
How can I not? This is my family.

364
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,868
We're family!

365
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,912
Couldn't you have told me sooner?

366
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,830
Don't you care about me at all?

367
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,124
I was so friendly with him
because I didn't know anything!

368
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,877
You must've thought I was pathetic!

369
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,671
This isn't about your mother

370
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,008
but about my daughter.

371
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,261
If you hadn't been born…

372
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,224
If she hadn't met your father
and had just stayed by my side,

373
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,601
none of this would have happened.

374
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,145
I'll be the one to take care of it,

375
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,106
and I'll be the one to tie everything up.

376
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:13,942
Fine.

377
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,403
You can deal with your daughter's death.

378
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,823
And I'll deal with my mom's.

379
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,242
We've never been family anyway.

380
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,801
Is she already in bed?

381
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,123
Bong Ye-bun.

382
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,460
Aren't you cold?

383
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,378
What are you doing here?

384
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,923
Did you run away from home?

385
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,551
Yes.

386
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:22,469
What?

387
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,554
For real?

388
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,556
Yes.

389
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,851
What is it this time?

390
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,563
Do you need comfort or do you need help?

391
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,565
Neither.

392
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,650
Is that so?

393
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,958
You look like

394
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,836
you're ready to talk.

395
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,174
At times like these,

396
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,886
I wish you were psychic too.

397
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,141
It's too embarrassing
and uncomfortable to explain all this.

398
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,144
I wish you could just know.

399
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,606
I don't need to be psychic to know.

400
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,610
You fought with your grandfather.

401
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,862
How did you know that?

402
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,991
You're too old to run away from home
after fighting with your aunt.

403
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,161
Plus, you're not on good terms with him.

404
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,004
He told me not to concern myself
with my own mother's death.

405
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,717
Then again, he never considered me
his granddaughter.

406
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:50,431
I guess that's why he can say
such hurtful things to me so casually.

407
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,810
Sometimes people say things

408
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,021
that they don't actually mean.

409
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,193
Do you think I can't tell the difference?

410
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,405
You can't know for sure
until you hear what he really thinks.

411
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,616
You could try touching him, you know.

412
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,538
Why not use your power
when you need it the most?

413
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,002
Because I'm scared.

414
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,129
Of what?

415
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,215
I'm scared I'll find out…

416
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,844
that my grandfather

417
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,930
truly hates me.

418
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,070
What are you doing here so late?

419
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,614
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

420
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,866
Sure, why not?

421
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,370
You're not going to ask why?

422
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,582
This isn't the first time you've come over
after arguing with your grandpa.

423
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,419
What a bunch of mind readers.

424
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,379
I'm going to sleep now.

425
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,340
Okay.

426
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,887
Ok-hui.

427
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,264
What?

428
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,350
My mom…

429
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,188
might not have committed suicide.

430
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,776
What?

431
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:30,073
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

432
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,033
Where are your parents?

433
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,535
They went out early to clean the nets.

434
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,372
So hard-working unlike somebody.

435
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,706
Why, you little.

436
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,878
Hey, if you're that suspicious of Mr. Cha,

437
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,296
just touch him.

438
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,757
There's too much to see.

439
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,217
A brief touch won't work.

440
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,845
I have to touch him for a long time
to see everything I want to.

441
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,933
But how am I going to touch the butt
of an assemblyman for that long?

442
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,399
Is that why you looked so sad?

443
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,609
I looked sad?

444
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,946
So all you need

445
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,573
is enough time to touch him?

446
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,761
Why did you have to park…

447
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,946
What the hell?

448
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,573
Where did he go?

449
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,550
You're an early bird.

450
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,844
Did you have breakfast?

451
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,814
I get off work at 9 a.m.

452
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,193
Then I'm going to my workshop
for some woodworking

453
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,445
and go home around 11 a.m.

454
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,030
I don't have any other plans.

455
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,909
Just a heads-up.

456
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,209
That bastard…

457
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,092
MUJIN POLICE STATION

458
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,219
Hey.

459
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,471
Yes, what did you want me to do?

460
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,473
Remember Kim Seon-woo
whom I asked you to look into?

461
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,390
Yes.

462
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,809
I want you to tail him.

463
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,186
Do you really have something on him?

464
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,479
You have to be discreet.

465
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,189
He catches on super fast.

466
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,108
Okay, I will.

467
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,572
What is it?

468
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,865
You punk.

469
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,661
All of that crap you were talking about
has made me paranoid too!

470
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,331
I'm suspecting him for a reason.

471
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:29,377
Anyway, even though
this should never ever happen,

472
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,923
let's just say that the next victim
is Assemblyman Cha.

473
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,969
CHA JU-MAN

474
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,013
Kim Seon-woo's motive for killing him
would be as clear as day.

475
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,351
A grudge.

476
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,313
But what's his motive
for killing the streamer?

477
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,983
Because she gave him her number?

478
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,112
And what about Park Seung-gil?

479
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,656
Because they were in Mujin
at the same time?

480
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,702
Then let's talk about Lee Ji-suk.

481
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,036
LEE JI-SUK (27)

482
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,789
He has no connection to her whatsoever.

483
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,961
They may not have had
any connections to Kim Seon-woo,

484
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,755
but the victims themselves
could share something in common.

485
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,716
Like what?

486
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,346
Female, male, female, male…

487
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,473
Is he promoting gender equality?

488
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,063
Listen.

489
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,108
This makes much more sense
than all your psychic gibberish.

490
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,038
Hello, Assemblyman Cha,
the pillar of Mujin!

491
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,164
Hey, Ok-hui.

492
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,373
What are you doing here?

493
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,666
I've been waiting for you.

494
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,293
For me? Why?

495
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,630
I've been thinking
about your campaign pledges,

496
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,882
and I think they favor
the older generation too much.

497
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,344
You didn't pledge a single thing
for the younger generation.

498
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:05,389
At this rate, things may be
difficult for you in the next election.

499
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,351
I hope you have many terms ahead of you.

500
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,229
So I'm really worried.

501
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,647
Is it that bad?

502
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,981
Yes!

503
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,983
Follow me.

504
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,198
And who are these people?

505
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,160
Representatives of the younger generation.

506
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,787
I'm a young daughter-in-law.

507
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,330
I'm a young business owner.

508
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,498
I'm all for that youth hustle culture.

509
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,250
And I'm a young extrovert.

510
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,292
Pardon?

511
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,338
Young people these days love
talking about their personality types.

512
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,927
But isn't it too early
to be in a place like this?

513
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:43,844
Mr. Cha.

514
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,181
Shouldn't you take every chance
to listen to the voices of the citizens?

515
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,809
All right then.

516
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,980
I'd love to hear what I can do
for the younger generation.

517
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,693
But first…

518
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,696
Shall we have a bit of a drink
before we start?

519
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:19,088
This is how young people
drink soju bombs these days.

520
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,215
You need to know
the culture of young people

521
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,509
if you want to understand them,
don't you agree?

522
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,096
But it's still so early in the day.

523
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,181
Hurry up and drink.

524
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,024
-Chug!
-Chug!

525
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,573
So what are your thoughts?

526
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:46,907
Next round!

527
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,882
-Chug!
-Chug!

528
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,970
Can you tell me your thoughts now?

529
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,141
I'm going to die.

530
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,229
He's too strong.

531
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,150
I'm…

532
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,528
never going to

533
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,405
get drunk.

534
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,365
Why?

535
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,701
Because I hate…

536
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,204
Because I hate seeing you

537
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,873
so sad.

538
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,099
Drink.

539
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,395
Drink, Mr. Cha.

540
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,608
Drink.

541
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,492
Ye-bun.

542
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,078
Ok-hui.

543
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,127
Sis.

544
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,090
Sis.

545
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,049
Oh, no.

546
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,953
These are the records of all the lands
that Assemblyman Yoon bought

547
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,706
and the bribes he gave to journalists

548
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,334
in return for writing
false articles about redevelopment.

549
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,754
It also contains the business plans
written up by him and the realtors.

550
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:51,133
I just need to testify in court, right?

551
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,092
That's right.

552
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,261
Thank you, Ju-man.

553
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,146
You idiot.

554
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,567
Did you really think I'd be satisfied
with being a mere assemblyman?

555
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,486
I'm going to go up as high as I can.

556
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,030
And then this district will be yours.

557
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:13,989
You moron.

558
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,993
Power will last longer
than any woman will.

559
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,411
Decide.

560
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,373
Whether to live your life as a cripple,
get back that evidence,

561
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:25,042
or make sure she can't use it.

562
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,179
Are you on a stakeout?

563
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,475
No, I'm not.

564
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,727
Come on.

565
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,188
Police officers from TV shows
always have bread and milk

566
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,733
when they're on stakeouts.

567
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,070
But why do you guys
always eat those during stakeouts?

568
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,448
I can't have a full meal
on a stakeout, can I?

569
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,534
It's because you can eat these quickly.

570
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,163
See? You're on a stakeout.

571
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,791
Please be on your way.

572
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,752
I was going to.

573
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,837
I have a lot of deliveries to make.

574
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,923
Keep up the good work.

575
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,352
MUJIN POLICE STATION

576
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,645
Captain.

577
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,023
Can you explain it to me one more time?

578
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,028
Are you serious?
I've already explained it to you 24 times.

579
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,575
I need to keep being reminded
so I won't forget.

580
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,536
You're a real handful, you know that?

581
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,288
Listen carefully.

582
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,290
All right.

583
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:33,170
Kim Seon-woo has a strong motive
to kill Assemblyman Cha.

584
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,129
Why?

585
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,549
He was supposed to testify against
Assemblyman Yoon Deok-hyeon in court,

586
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,759
but he never did.

587
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,471
In the end, Yoon Deok-hyeon's
corruption charges were dropped,

588
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,892
and then Kim Seon-woo's mother vanished.

589
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,893
How would you feel?

590
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,978
You'd want to kill him too.

591
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,148
Imagine how devastated you'd feel

592
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,235
after being stabbed in the back
by Assemblyman Cha

593
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,653
when you trusted him so much.

594
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,780
Betrayal…

595
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,035
KIM SI-A

596
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,788
PARK SEUNG-GIL

597
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,085
What are you doing here?

598
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,086
Jang-yeol…

599
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Betrayal.

600
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,093
Maybe it's about betrayal.

601
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,512
The first victim, Kim Si-a.

602
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,597
Do I have a boyfriend?

603
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,307
I've never been in a relationship.

604
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,353
She received donations from her viewers
by pretending to be single.

605
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,021
Give me a call. I'll buy you a drink.

606
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,441
And then she hit on Kim Seon-woo.

607
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,067
The third victim, Lee Ji-suk.

608
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,527
Why did you do it?

609
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,654
I told you about Ae-ran
because I trusted you.

610
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:43,240
-Gwang-sik!
-She pretended to care about Ae-ran,

611
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,159
but she was actually her boss's spy.

612
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,328
BETRAYAL

613
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,124
Park Seung-gil betrayed the detective
who trusted him and sided with Baek.

614
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:56,503
All the victims betrayed someone.

615
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,965
But why would Kim Seon-woo care?

616
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,509
If you're right,

617
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,846
then Kim Seon-woo would have killed
Assemblyman Cha

618
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,557
for betraying his mom.

619
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,311
So why would he kill these people?

620
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,024
The person who would hold a grudge
against Ji-suk for betraying Ae-ran

621
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,109
would be Gwang-sik.

622
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:23,363
And you're the one
that Park Seung-gil betrayed.

623
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,451
Shouldn't you be the suspect then?

624
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:32,247
This is what happens
when you rely on your gut feelings.

625
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:33,999
And another thing.

626
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:38,212
You can't really label what that streamer
and Lee Ji-suk did as betrayal.

627
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,675
You're just trying to
lump things together.

628
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,679
From Kim Seon-woo's perspective,
they could all be seen as betrayals.

629
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,932
Fine.

630
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,475
Then what about this?

631
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,769
Let's go out on a limb and say

632
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:58,232
that Kim Seon-woo murdered these people
because he felt like meddling.

633
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,984
But tell me this.

634
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,905
How would he even know

635
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,367
what these victims have done?

636
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,411
Are you saying that one of us is a spy

637
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,290
who told him all of this stuff?

638
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,252
He would have been able to know.

639
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,713
If he is psychic.

640
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,056
What the…

641
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,024
Where's Kim Seon-woo?

642
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,025
Where is he?

643
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,569
Seon-woo?

644
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,114
He told me something came up
and asked me to fill in for him.

645
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,282
When was that?

646
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,783
Over an hour ago.

647
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,704
How could he just…

648
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,751
-Yes, Detective Bae?
-Jang-yeol.

649
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,044
Kim Seon-woo disappeared.

650
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,422
-What?
-He left after telling his coworker

651
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,007
that something came up.

652
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,466
I'm sorry.

653
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,261
Go check his place and workshop right now.

654
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,679
Where are you going?

655
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,682
Request backup and come to
Assemblyman Cha's office with the captain.

656
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,559
-Hurry!
-Understood.

657
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,935
Kim Seon-woo, that bastard.

658
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,876
What happened to my father?

659
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,003
-Please wait at home.
-Auntie.

660
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,380
Hyeon-ok.

661
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,507
Jong-muk, what happened?

662
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,966
Please tell me.

663
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,593
Captain.

664
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,638
Why won't anyone tell me anything?

665
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,527
The murder weapon
and the random stab wounds

666
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,153
are the same as the other murders.

667
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,533
Then are you saying
that Dr. Jung is the serial killer?

668
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,451
Everything points to him.

669
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,120
There's no denying it.

670
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,967
Did something happen?

671
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,387
I heard police cars
and ambulances rushing by.

672
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,141
Assemblyman Cha Ju-man is dead.

673
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,311
You don't seem surprised.

674
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,398
Let me ask you a question.

675
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,360
You left work an hour early today.
What did you do?

676
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,320
Didn't Detective Bae tell you?

677
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,699
It seemed like he was watching me.

678
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,916
I came straight to my workshop.

679
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,462
Every time something happens,
this workshop is your excuse.

680
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,381
How convenient is that?

681
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,592
You make it sound as if

682
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,679
I got this workshop
to create alibis for myself.

683
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,642
If we're done,

684
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,270
will you excuse me?

685
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,540
Assemblyman Cha died on the scene.

686
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:30,003
And your grandfather was found unconscious
and was brought right to the hospital.

687
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,548
He'll be okay after the surgery, right?

688
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:38,678
Bong Ye-bun.

689
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,935
Your grandfather was holding the weapon
that killed Assemblyman Cha.

690
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,106
I know I shouldn't be saying this
in this situation.

691
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,152
But if we want to know
exactly what happened,

692
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,488
we need your power.

693
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,741
Wait, are you…

694
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,035
Are you telling me

695
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,163
to go to my grandfather and…

696
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,173
I need to go
and look after my aunt right now.

697
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,259
I'll see you later.

698
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,224
Dad.

699
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,978
Dad.

700
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,814
-Grandpa.
-Dad.

701
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,440
Grandpa.

702
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,405
He's still unconscious,
so we'll monitor him for the time being.

703
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,908
When can we see him?

704
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,411
Not for the time being.

705
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,954
What do you mean?

706
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,748
I'm his daughter. Why can't I see him?

707
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,170
MUJIN POLICE STATION

708
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,381
-Captain.
-Yeah?

709
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,926
We need to pack up all the materials
on the serial killer and Assemblyman Cha.

710
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,136
What for?

711
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,721
An assemblyman was just killed.

712
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,015
The Major Crimes Division
will set up their base here

713
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,558
and exclude us from the investigation.

714
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,603
Then the case will be closed
with whatever conclusion they reach,

715
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,105
and they'll pin the murders on Dr. Jung.

716
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,441
But the killer is clearly Dr. Jung.

717
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,692
We don't know that yet.

718
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,985
We haven't investigated.

719
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,405
What are you doing?
Hurry up and pack things up!

720
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,991
We need to finish what we started, right?

721
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,618
Hey, take that down.

OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

724
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,807
All right.

725
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,352
-So this is our headquarters for now?
-Yes.

726
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,396
It may be uncomfortable
but just bear with us.

727
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,066
Detective Na,
unpack the investigation files.

728
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,027
And Detective Bae,
you set up the status board.

729
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,028
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

730
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,822
I'm going to go to the scene
and then check on Dr. Jung.

731
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,865
Okay.

732
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,742
Call me if anything happens, okay?

733
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,243
-I will.
-All right.

734
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,000
They're not even letting
his family visit him.

735
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,044
But you're allowed in there.

736
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,421
Could you go and see
how my grandfather is doing?

737
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,548
I was actually on my way there.

738
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:22,926
Thank you.

739
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,633
There's blood here.

740
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,052
So did the killer turn off the lights
after he stabbed him?

741
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,221
But why?

742
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,579
MEDICAL RECORD

743
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,553
Breaking news.

744
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,890
Mujin's assemblyman, Cha Ju-man,

745
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,351
was brutally attacked in his office
and was found dead at the scene.

746
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,396
The prime suspect
is the 82-year-old Mr. Jung,

747
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,939
who was also found at the scene.

748
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,192
After having committed the crime,

749
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,653
Mr. Jung stabbed himself in the chest
in an attempt to commit suicide.

750
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,530
Ye…

751
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,867
Ye-bun, they're not talking
about your grandfather, are they?

752
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,080
I have to go talk to Jong-muk.

753
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,253
You bastard!

754
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,671
Why, you…

755
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,714
Why did you do it?

756
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,132
You'll find out later.

757
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,842
I'll be the one to take care of it,

758
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,511
and I'll be the one to tie everything up.

759
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,976
Why is my father a suspect?

760
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,646
There must've been a misunderstanding.
You know that.

761
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,107
Of course I don't think he did it either.

762
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,317
But the situation doesn't look good.

763
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,530
It's already painful enough
that he's unconscious.

764
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,491
And now I have to hear people
call him a murderer?

765
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,493
-I'll tell them.
-No.

766
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,621
I'll tell everyone
that my father isn't a murderer!

767
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,832
-Wait!
-Let go of me.

768
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,125
Let go!

769
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,292
Listen to me, Hyeon-ok.

770
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,672
He blamed Assemblyman Cha

771
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,341
for the death of his eldest daughter.

772
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:11,970
He would curse out Mr. Cha
whenever he was drunk.

773
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:15,473
I suspect that he campaigned alongside him

774
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,100
in order to get his revenge.

775
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,726
An Gyeong-taek!

776
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,270
-Come here!
-Hyeon-ok.

777
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,689
-You bastard!
-You have to calm down.

778
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,732
How could you do this?

779
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,734
How could you be saying that

780
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:29,571
-about my father, you bastard?
-Come on.

781
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:34,742
Hurry.

782
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,872
-Why are you just standing here?
-We can't go in.

783
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,915
Some crazy women
are guarding the hospital.

784
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,169
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

785
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,463
Don't come any closer!

786
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,215
Don't even think about it.

787
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,222
Detective Moon, you may pass.

788
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,516
Freeze!

789
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:00,894
Back off.

790
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,402
Don't come any closer.

791
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,573
How dare you try to get in there?

792
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,116
Just try us!

793
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,039
How's my grandfather?

794
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,707
He's still unconscious.

795
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,463
Anything else you want to know?

796
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,177
Why aren't you asking me

797
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,679
whether your grandfather
really killed Assemblyman Cha

798
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,224
and then tried to kill himself?

799
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,813
Do you think
your grandfather is the killer?

800
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,193
Seventeen years.

801
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,989
He spent 17 years trying to prove
that his daughter didn't kill herself.

802
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,658
And is one day enough for you

803
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,202
to conclude that he's the killer?

804
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,412
What are you trying to say?

805
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:04,457
Your grandfather isn't the killer.

806
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,129
He was suffering from Parkinson's disease.

807
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,426
What are you talking about?

808
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:20,014
He would never have been able to
hold that knife properly.

809
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,183
His movements
must also have slowed down a lot.

810
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:26,145
And his limbs must have started shaking,
causing him to take quick, short steps.

811
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,107
-Could you hold me?
-He probably couldn't get up on his own.

812
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,570
I did think it was strange then.

813
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,863
He probably always looked so stern

814
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,325
because his condition made it difficult
for him to make facial expressions.

815
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,873
Your grandfather's not the killer.

816
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,794
You're the only person
who can stop the real killer's rampage.

817
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,047
I need you.

818
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:07,520
FOR PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S…

819
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,401
FOR PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S…

820
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,647
Ye-bun.

821
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,151
Make sure not to lose this photo.

822
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,070
Why?

823
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,322
We have many other pictures
from field day.

824
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:01,824
Just don't lose it.

825
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,287
Why are you crying?

826
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:12,710
I'm just…

827
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:16,130
so happy.

828
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,225
Why not use your power
when you need it the most?

829
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,986
-Let me through.
-No visitors allowed.

830
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,239
Get out of my way.
I need to see my grandfather.

831
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,241
-Please let me go see him.
-No.

832
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,575
-Please.
-Let her in.

833
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,035
I'll take care of everything.

834
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,349
Grandpa.

835
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,594
Father, Ye-bun got into veterinary school.

836
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,306
We have to head over to Mr. Ji's barn,
so get ready.

01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,392
Grandpa!

841
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,061
Grandpa.

842
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,230
Grandpa.

843
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,148
Grandpa.

844
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,692
Grandpa.

845
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,945
Grandpa!

846
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,698
Grandpa!

847
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,246
A new suspect
of Assemblyman Cha Ju-man's murder

848
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,498
has been arrested.

849
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,043
The suspect has been revealed to be
a Mujin resident named Mr. Park.

850
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,629
The police are currently
investigating Mr. Park's motive

851
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,840
and the exact circumstances
of the incident.

852
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,510
-Why are they taking him?
-That's the shaman.

853
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,110
So did he kill
Assemblyman Cha and Dr. Jung?

854
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:01,063
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

855
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,774
Mr. Jung Ui-hwan
didn't kill Assemblyman Cha.

856
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,028
He was a witness who was killed
by the serial killer and framed.

857
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,946
I should've touched him sooner.

858
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,699
I should have tried to understand him.

859
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:16,120
You killed Assemblyman Cha
and put the knife in Mr. Jung's hand!

860
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,873
I saw the shaman
go into Assemblyman Cha's office

861
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,124
with a knife in his hand.

862
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,335
I even touched his leg
just now to be sure.

863
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:25,004
And that would mean
that Kim Seon-woo wasn't the killer.

864
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,214
Yes, Detective Na. What?

865
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,842
Finding and stopping him comes first.

866
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,553
What happens if he really did run away?

867
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,222
Then we'll have a mad dog out there.
