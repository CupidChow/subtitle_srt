1
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,008
We're going to track down
the psychic on this day.

3
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,760
Mom.

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,096
It's Kim Seon-woo.
He's our prime suspect, so focus.

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,473
I'll really have to decline.

6
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,559
He can't be the killer.
A quick check will do.

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,727
Goodbye.

8
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,023
I saw Kim Seon-woo
going toward Mount Mujin.

9
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,401
Try to locate Kim Seon-woo
as you touch other people.

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,986
-Make way for the car, please.
-Seon-woo

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,697
-was following Assemblyman Cha.
-Please move to the side.

12
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,034
Why does Kim Seon-woo
keep crossing paths with Assemblyman Cha?

13
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,827
Where is he now?

14
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,913
-At his barn, sir.
-Let's go there.

15
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,332
Assemblyman Cha came to the barn that day.

16
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,292
I think he came to meet my father.

17
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,211
-You have to take this call.
-Who is it?

18
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,837
The representative of the Central Party.

19
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,005
There's someone there.

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,424
It's Mr. Park.

21
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,425
Yeah?

22
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,349
He was there.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,518
Kim Seon-woo.

24
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,188
He was behind that pillar
on the night of the meteor shower!

25
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
Then Kim Seon-woo must be the killer.

26
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,739
There's a good chance that he is.

27
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,492
Then shouldn't you catch him quick?

28
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,035
Right.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,370
He might kill again.

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,371
Arrest him already.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,414
And what?

32
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,837
Why is Kim Seon-woo the killer?

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,256
He was standing behind the pillar
near the barn

34
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,966
on the night of the meteor shower.

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,844
What's so wrong about that?

36
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,179
Let me explain.

37
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,185
Based on the wounds of the murder victims,

38
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,688
the killer commits murders
with his eyes closed.

39
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,106
Why is that?

40
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,776
It's to hide his crimes from being seen.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,194
Seen by who?

42
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,988
By those with psychometric powers.

43
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,366
But how did these people
come to have these powers?

44
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,617
It was through the light

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,579
coming from a cow
that got hit by a meteorite.

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,790
They see people's memories
by touching either the leg or the butt.

47
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,170
But they can only see what's been
projected onto people's retinas.

48
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,838
So if the killer closes his eyes,

49
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,506
the psychics can't see anything.

50
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,468
And the serial killer knew this!

51
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,973
But how did he find this out
in the first place?

52
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,020
It's because he too
had psychometric powers

53
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,230
that let him see people's memories!

54
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,983
With these clues put together,

55
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,484
I've come to the conclusion

56
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,739
that the guy who was standing
near the barn that night

57
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,073
is the serial killer!

58
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,578
And how did you know he was near the barn?

59
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:29,042
The good-hearted psychics saw it
by touching each other's leg and butt.

60
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,502
And that guy was Kim Seon-woo?

61
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,420
Yes.

62
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,881
But there's no concrete evidence,
is there?

63
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,425
Sadly, that is the case for now.

64
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,177
What do you mean, "sadly"?

65
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,221
We already have more than enough evidence.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,973
Take him away.

67
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,185
Hey, buddy.

68
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,437
Let's take your medication
after your meal.

69
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,149
Why are you drooling so much?

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,987
We need concrete evidence
to catch Kim Seon-woo.

71
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,281
The rain poncho
or the murder weapon, for instance.

72
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,659
How do we find them?

73
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,954
We have to get him on the Butt of Truth.

74
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,623
Then we'll be able to find evidence.

75
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,587
Bong Ye-bun.

76
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,257
-Yes?
-You heard me, right?

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,758
Yes.

78
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,386
We're almost there. Let's do this.

79
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,804
Okay.

80
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,500
There you are, Justin.
Your dad's looking for you.

81
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
He is?

82
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,429
Justin!

83
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
You got a teddy bear?

84
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,392
I won it for him.

85
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,686
Why were you looking for Justin?

86
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,438
What? I was?

87
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:18,192
His eyes were getting teary,
so I assumed that he missed Justin.

88
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,445
Didn't you miss him?

89
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,073
I mean, I always miss my son.

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,450
I knew it.

91
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,287
Oh, and I saw that you can have
your pictures taken over there.

92
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,497
Let's go check it out.
Justin would love it.

93
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,708
But I have to watch the booth.

94
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,586
Come on, Seon-woo can watch it for you.

95
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,503
Right?

96
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,631
Yes, I'll be here.

97
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,842
-Go ahead.
-Really?

98
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,302
Then I'll be right back.

99
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,345
Let's go.

100
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,056
Justin!

101
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,132
There you are.

102
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,343
I've been looking for you.

103
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,387
For me?

104
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,889
Why?

105
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,060
I'd like a word with you.

106
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:35,937
So have a seat.

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,814
I'm fine standing.

108
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,110
It's going to take a while, so please.

109
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,569
I'm not sure.

110
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,905
I can't think of anything

111
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,324
to talk about with you for that long.

112
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,633
I heard you made this.

113
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,927
I did.

114
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,762
Quite impressive.

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,681
Did you learn woodworking?

116
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,559
I'm self-taught. It's just a hobby.

117
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,272
Why would a Hankook University graduate
with such great skill

118
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,150
be working part-time
at a convenience store in Mujin,

119
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,110
a place you have no connection with?

120
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,324
Because I wanted to kill people.

121
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,251
Is that what you wanted to hear?

122
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,216
Why do you keep

123
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,719
suspecting me?

124
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,931
I've never done anything suspicious.

125
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,271
It's my instinct as a detective
who is desperate to catch the killer.

126
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,523
Instinct? More like incompetence.

127
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,736
You're exercising violence
by suspecting someone

128
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,778
without any evidence.

129
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
Let's call it a skill.

130
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,076
Sometimes, detectives have to trust
their guts rather than evidence.

131
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,373
This feels a bit unfair,

132
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,085
but I guess there's nothing to be done
since it's your job.

133
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,588
I'll try to understand.

134
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,827
I'll just swoop in and touch him
one of these days.

135
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,663
No, don't do that.

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,501
If Kim Seon-woo really is the killer,
he's probably onto us already.

137
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,086
We don't know what he'll do next.

138
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,130
It could put both of you in danger,

139
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,132
so please don't do anything rash.

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,010
Then what are you planning to do?

141
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,055
I've caught criminals just fine
without psychics before.

142
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,142
You all did great.

143
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,770
Thanks for your help today, Ok-hui.

144
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,233
I did it for Ye-bun, not you.

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,446
Bong Ye-bun.

146
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,031
Yes?

147
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,616
Is something wrong?

148
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,702
No.

149
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,912
Nothing's wrong.

150
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,625
As if you would understand.

151
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,556
Captain, I see that you met

152
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,934
Dr. Bong's grandfather recently.

153
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,271
This is the last article my sister wrote.

154
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,814
She was investigating this case.

155
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,692
But she died
before she could finish investigating it.

156
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,580
Hey, you're home late.

157
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,874
Yeah. I'm going to bed.

158
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,001
Ye-bun.

159
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
What the… Are you drunk?

160
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,011
A bit.

161
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,972
What is it? Is something wrong?

162
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
Nothing like that.

163
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,436
It's just that I'm proud of you.

164
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,900
You grew up to be
such a wonderful young woman.

165
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,616
Do you want to

166
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,203
go visit your mom tomorrow?
It's been a while.

167
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,007
Hi, Mi-ok.

168
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,634
We're here.

169
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,721
How have you been?

170
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:26,143
HERE LIES JUNG MI-OK

171
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,192
Your mom passed at 40,

172
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,652
and you're already 35.

173
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,153
I know.

174
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,240
You remind me of her more and more.

175
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,575
Both your face and your personality.

176
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,912
What was she like at my age?

177
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,167
She was passionate and righteous.

178
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,796
She never turned away from people in need.

179
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,674
She stood by their side
and got their stories out.

180
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,926
She was

181
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,179
a great journalist.

182
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,102
Then why would she

183
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,188
do such a thing?

184
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,950
I wish I could have read
her mind back then.

185
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,205
She didn't leave any notes,

186
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,832
so nobody knows.

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
I wonder why
she didn't leave any messages.

188
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,631
She could have

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,509
said something to her own daughter.

190
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,013
Apparently, she told Ju-man

191
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,391
that she'd been having a hard time.

192
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,852
To Mr. Cha?

193
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,811
Yeah.

194
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,608
I guess some things
are harder to talk about with your family.

195
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,695
Were the two of them

196
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,281
very close?

197
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,533
You could say that.

198
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,579
He used to have a huge crush on her
when he was younger.

199
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,123
He did?

200
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,124
Yeah.

201
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,251
I don't know why I just told you that.

202
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,588
I guess being here takes me back.

203
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,845
How many times do I have to come here?

204
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,681
Who's going to run my business?

205
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,684
The faster you answer our questions,
the faster you can return to your store.

206
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,812
What am I supposed to tell you
when I don't know anything?

207
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,190
Why are all these people here?

208
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,692
They're here
regarding Ms. Lee Ji-suk's murder.

209
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,985
Again? Why?

210
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,654
We were told to start over.

211
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,744
Everyone, you can all go home. It's fine.

212
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,788
You're dismissed.

213
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,166
Hey!

214
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,044
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,088
They have nothing to do with the case.

216
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,382
You can go.

217
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,720
If you're so sure,
why haven't you found a single lead?

218
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,514
God knows what you're up to.

219
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,808
Yes, Chief.

220
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,059
Yes, sir.

221
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,480
Captain, the chief
wants you in his office.

222
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,192
But why did he call you?

223
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,905
Has he been somewhere?

224
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,908
He'd been called by the higher-ups.

225
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,953
Okay.

226
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,706
Damn it.

227
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,460
Hey, where's my other kneepad?

228
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,671
The traffic captain took it
to play soccer.

229
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,299
I can't believe him.

230
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,718
He's never any help.

231
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,474
Goodness,

232
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,685
-if it isn't Captain Won.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,812
-Captain Won.
-Yes, sir.

234
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,399
Good to see you, Captain Won.

235
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,984
Or should I say, "Chief Won"?

236
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,902
Come sit.

237
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,486
-Well…
-Come on.

238
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,446
What's going on?

239
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,367
I feel like you're not catching
the killer on purpose

240
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,411
so you can get me fired and take my seat.

241
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,370
No, sir.

242
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,373
I haven't been home
or changed my underwear in three days.

243
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,666
Do you want to see it?

244
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't be like that.

245
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,588
-You know I trust you.
-Okay.

246
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,881
-Have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

247
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,889
Look at you. You look so haggard.

248
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,392
Have you eaten?

249
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,686
Yes, I had ox bone soup.

250
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,229
Good.

251
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,648
Do you have the receipt?

252
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,149
Yes, I do.

253
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,192
Show me.

254
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,193
Here.

255
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,200
Three of you had regular ox bone soup,

256
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,702
and one of you had an extra-large.

257
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,496
Well, you see…

258
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,290
I've been feeling weak lately.

259
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,625
Good job.

260
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,418
So did your soup

261
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,587
come with extra meat?

262
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,881
For some strange reason,

263
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,050
it didn't.

264
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,553
That's interesting.

265
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,639
What do you mean?

266
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,975
You said…

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,688
your soup didn't come with any extra meat

268
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,815
but guess who's dead meat.

269
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,901
I don't understand.

270
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,821
I think you do.

271
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,952
Wait a minute.

272
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,246
Where's my sunscreen?

273
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,081
Sunscreen?

274
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,959
I don't want to get a tan

275
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,044
when I bury you later.

276
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,463
Sir, I'll work harder from now on.

277
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,050
So that's why you're so pale.
You've been slacking off.

278
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,261
No, it's been pretty cloudy lately.

279
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,971
-Is that right? Listen.
-Yes.

280
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,432
Do you know the poem,

281
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,017
Song of the Yellow Bird?

282
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,269
How does it go?

283
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,188
Look at those orioles

284
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,150
Flying in the sky in pairs

285
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,986
But alas, your kneepad is all alone

286
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,886
My goodness.

287
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,527
Excuse me.

288
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,988
Do you have a moment?

289
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,701
You didn't have to.

290
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,120
Thank you so much.

291
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,831
I've heard

292
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,834
that the victims of the redevelopment scam

293
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,754
used to get together and protest.

294
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,090
That's right.

295
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,802
We were grasping at straws
after losing everything we had.

296
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,970
Looking back,

297
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,555
it was all pointless.

298
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,391
Could you take a look at this?

299
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,351
Here.

300
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,148
Now I remember.

301
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,735
This woman was the chairperson
of the emergency committee.

302
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,447
She brought her son with her
because she couldn't find a babysitter.

303
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,409
I felt for her since she was a single mom.

304
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,953
MUJIN REDEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE PROTEST

305
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,379
Let's eat some gimbap.

306
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,672
No.

307
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,757
Come on, let's eat.

308
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,468
No, I want chips.

309
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,637
You only ate chips yesterday.
No more chips.

310
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
Here, sweetie.

311
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,891
Thank you.

312
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,643
Thank you.

313
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,687
Do you perhaps

314
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,148
have her contact information?

315
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,110
There's no use trying to contact her.

316
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,155
She's gone missing.

317
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,573
Sorry?

318
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,118
Her boy was so adorable and smart.

319
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,704
I wonder how he managed without his mom.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,585
PERSONAL INFORMATION
NAME: KIM SEON-WOO

321
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,635
Hello.

322
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,179
-Hello.
-Hello.

323
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,641
I wonder why Mr. Cha is here.

324
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,147
It must be tedious and lonely
to stay home after having been so busy.

325
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,441
Not at all.

326
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,818
This is where I belong.

327
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,904
Come now.

328
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,324
Please tell me what I can do for you.

329
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,534
You're my number one contributor.

330
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,952
It's the least I can do.

331
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:04,953
Stop it.

332
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,207
It's detestable to see
politicians doing stuff like this

333
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,750
as soon as they enter office.

334
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,794
Now that you won, I couldn't ask for more.

335
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,091
You're so selfless, sir.

336
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,802
You're making me ashamed of myself.

337
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,306
-Hey, good to see you.
-Hi.

338
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,515
Oh, my. What's this?

339
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,601
Thank you so much.

340
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,312
Hello.

341
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,396
Hey, Ye-bun.

342
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,648
How have you been?

343
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,234
I've been okay.

344
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,860
All right then.

345
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,820
You should get going. You must be busy.

346
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,697
Okay, sir.

347
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,617
I'll visit again soon.

348
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,707
Wait up, Mr. Cha.

349
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,927
Did you meet with Captain Won recently?

350
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,973
I heard you asked him for a favor.

351
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,975
It was nothing.

352
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,853
Then why were you collecting
Mi-ok's articles?

353
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,780
Every article she wrote,
including the very last one.

354
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,158
Why are you digging into something
that happened over a decade ago?

355
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,576
What is this about?

356
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,830
What are you hiding from me?

357
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,251
I wanted to ask you something.

358
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,715
Auntie told me

359
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,137
that you and my mom used to be very close.

360
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,180
That's right.

361
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,057
We used to be pretty close.

362
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,519
Mr. Cha.

363
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,272
I want to know

364
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,317
the reason why my mom committed suicide.

365
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,194
She left without saying anything

366
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,781
to me, my grandpa, or my aunt.

367
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,577
But I heard she told you
that she'd been going through a hard time.

368
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,664
What troubled her so much?

369
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,751
You must know.

370
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,092
Your mom seemed strong on the outside,

371
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,761
but she was so soft-hearted.

372
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,804
She even suffered from depression.

373
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,142
Did you know she was on medication?

374
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,020
No.

375
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,482
She probably didn't want to worry you.

376
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,903
The story she had been covering
was eating away at her.

377
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,780
She used to rant about it to me,

378
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,699
but I was too busy back then.

379
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,413
I should have taken better care of her.

380
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,540
I was so caught up in climbing the ladder.

381
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,544
I hadn't seen her in months

382
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,464
until she passed.

383
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:14,184
Make sure to call whenever you need me.

384
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,436
I'll be on my way now.

385
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,407
Your sister

386
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,661
didn't kill herself.

387
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,879
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

388
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,173
He doesn't have any criminal records.
He's clean.

389
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,592
I suspected that much.
What about his military service?

390
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,761
He was exempt from service.

391
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,805
When he was perfectly fit?

392
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,433
His father is deceased,
and his mother is missing.

393
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,434
Missing?

394
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,604
But why did you ask me to look into him?

395
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,607
I was just curious.

396
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,464
Why did you sneak into his room
while he was away?

397
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:56,304
You probably think
Mr. Kim is such a kind and polite person.

398
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,184
You know he's tutoring me
in English, right?

399
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,020
He scolds me so harshly

400
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,856
whenever I get something wrong on a quiz.

401
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,359
He scorns and humiliates me.

402
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:13,113
He even threatens to show my quiz
to Justin if I don't make the cut.

403
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,491
Are you happy

404
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,870
now that you've shown him everything?

405
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:27,294
I think I got a question wrong,

406
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,087
so I was going to fix my answer.

407
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:35,468
You thought gemstones
were measured in "carrots"?

408
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,886
Yes.

409
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,726
So what were you doing in his room?

410
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,769
I was…

411
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,774
I wanted to make sure
he was doing all right by himself.

412
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,487
You're not a good liar, Detective Moon.

413
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,951
You're suspecting him, aren't you?

414
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,332
How did you know?

415
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,793
Why else would a detective
sneak into someone's house?

416
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,087
It's not like you're here to steal.

417
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,381
Am I right?

418
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,317
I should mind my own business.

419
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:33,818
I should…

420
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,557
I followed Kim Seon-woo to his workshop.

421
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,728
Stay away from him.

422
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,282
I think he fell asleep.

423
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,742
This is our chance.

424
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,079
No, it's too dangerous. Get out of there.

425
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:33,772
JEON GWANG-SIK

426
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,051
Gwang-sik.

427
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,719
Gwang-sik.

428
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,805
Gwang…

429
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,640
Gwang-sik.

430
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:20,318
I told you not to act on your own.

431
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,111
Gwang-sik.

432
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,822
Gwang-sik…

433
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,573
Gwang-sik, no!

434
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:28,284
Gwang-sik!

435
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,038
Gwang-sik…

436
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,416
Detective Moon?

437
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,544
Gwang-sik?

438
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,713
There's nothing wrong with my bones.

439
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:44,926
They gave me a tetanus shot
and an antibiotic shot.

440
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,721
But my hands will be wrapped
in bandages for the time being.

441
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,810
Take these for a week.

442
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,187
Thank you.

443
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,106
What on earth happened?

444
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,234
The thing is,

445
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:05,822
I quite enjoyed woodworking
at the festival,

446
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,324
so I wanted to ask him to teach me and…

447
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,784
Did you do this to him?

448
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,871
It's not like that.

449
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:17,542
He was asleep when I went inside,

450
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,670
so I walked over to wake him up.

451
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,380
But then his eyes opened wide,

452
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,799
and I got so startled
that I fell on my back.

453
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,427
And that's when the lumber fell on me.

454
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,344
Yes.

455
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,347
So I brought him to the hospital.

456
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,809
But how did you know to find him here?

457
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,272
That's…

458
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,485
We are very close.

459
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,196
We're like brothers.

460
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,531
Right, bro?

461
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,242
-Yes, bro.
-Yeah.

462
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,706
I'll call you a taxi.

463
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,625
You got hurt because of me.

464
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,920
No way. It's fine.

465
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,964
I shouldn't have snuck in
in the first place.

466
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,716
Still…

467
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,761
I can drive Gwang-sik home.

468
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,138
-Let's go, bro.
-Okay, bro.

469
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,066
-Is that really it?
-What?

470
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,027
Are you sure you fell on your own?

471
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,154
Yes, it's true.

472
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,574
Luckily, Mr. Kim blocked
the lumber with his hands.

473
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,701
Otherwise, it would have been really bad.

474
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,162
He just

475
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,207
doesn't seem like such a bad person.

476
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,751
Do you really think
he's the serial killer?

477
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,006
Whatever the case, I apologize.

478
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,759
You got hurt while helping me.

479
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,636
Don't worry about it.

480
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,597
You were the one who got Ae-ran out.

481
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,182
I wanted to repay you.

482
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,894
Just leave things to me for now,
and take care of yourself.

483
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,479
Ae-ran would be worried.

484
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,189
Gwang-sik!

485
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,693
Are you okay?

486
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,486
You're okay, right?

487
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,363
I'm okay.

488
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,074
Are you sure?

489
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,703
Hey, Bun Bun.

490
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,287
Where are you?

491
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,833
Do you want to have a drink with me?
It's been a while.

492
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,794
No, I can't drink while I'm on the job.

493
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,962
What job?

494
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,047
A very important job.

495
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,758
You know it's dangerous
to go out for a drink, right?

496
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,804
Of course, I was going to drink at home.

497
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,931
Okay, make sure to drink at home.

498
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,100
Don't go anywhere else, all right?

499
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,268
All right.

500
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,521
Sorry for calling you over again.

501
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,981
-Not at all, sis!
-Not at all, sis!

502
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,193
I want to ask you
for a personal favor today.

503
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,404
I have a friend
I cherish more than my life.

504
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,573
I need your help to protect her.

505
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,907
-Yes, sis!
-Yes, sis!

506
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,618
Did you all bring
the deadliest weapons you own?

507
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,287
Eun-hye, show me.

508
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,457
What is that?

509
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,083
It's hair dye.

510
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,585
How is that a weapon?

511
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,712
Put this in your hair,
and your eyes sting like crazy.

512
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:08,921
You're incapacitated.

513
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,965
Fair enough.

514
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,508
Su-jin, what did you bring?

515
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,178
And that is?

516
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,637
Five layers of gel nail polish.

517
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,560
All right.

518
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,063
Mi-yeong.

519
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,689
You didn't bring anything.

520
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,191
Just a second.

521
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,530
You had your vocal cords done too?

522
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,531
Yes, sis.

523
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,408
-Yes, sis.
-Good for you.

524
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:38,826
Thank you.

525
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,411
Yeong-hui.

526
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,170
-Who's this?
-She's my mother-in-law.

527
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,089
Hello, ma'am.

528
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,508
Why did you bring her here?

529
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,094
She's the deadliest person I know.

530
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,098
Would you like me to demonstrate?

531
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,724
Sure.

532
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,769
You impudent brat.

533
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,563
Have you no manners?

534
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,233
Am I invisible to you?

535
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,153
You still shouldn't have tagged along--

536
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,906
Who are you to lecture me?

537
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,326
You must take me for a fool
to spew that nonsense at me!

538
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,037
You awful little snake.

539
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,674
She really is deadly.

540
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,093
Okay then. Let's divide up the roles.

541
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,053
We'll be working in two shifts.

542
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:43,266
This half will patrol around
Bong's Animal Hospital whenever you can.

543
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,395
And this half will stand by
at my family's corner store

544
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,231
and be dispatched
as soon as something happens.

545
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,316
All right, get moving.

546
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,448
Why are you here?

547
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,742
I told you it was over between us.

548
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,957
The prize we won at the festival arrived,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

549
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,751
Didn't I tell you to sell it
and split the cash?

550
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,503
Why would you bring me this?

551
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,672
It's a prize we won together.

552
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,549
How could you tell me to send it away?

553
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,676
What are you suggesting?

554
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,182
I think it'd be best if you take it.

555
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,019
Will you be okay with that?

556
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,106
I'll just come by whenever I miss it.

557
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,358
Once you send it over, that's that.

558
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,112
I think I deserve that much.

559
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,697
Then you just take it.

560
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,032
Throw it away if you want.

561
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,159
The TV is listening!

562
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,245
What's going on between them?

563
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,997
Can't you tell?

564
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,000
-Neither wants to keep the TV.
-You're hurting its feelings.

565
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,669
Like a couple fighting
over custody of their children.

566
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,646
What are you doing here?

567
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,763
What were you thinking about all alone?

568
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
You looked sad.

569
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
I was thinking about my mom.

570
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,445
The last time I saw her

571
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,532
was by the sea right here.

572
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,663
When she was feeling lonelier than ever,

573
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,917
I was busy chatting with my friends.

574
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,422
I should have been there for her.

575
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,426
But I didn't know anything.

576
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,762
I didn't know what she was thinking about

577
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:32,393
or what was troubling her so much
that she wanted to die.

578
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,149
I was too immature.

579
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,736
You're a good person, Dr. Bong.

580
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,576
I never wanted to know about such things.

581
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,953
Sorry?

582
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,664
I hated her.

583
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,045
I didn't want to forgive my mother

584
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,590
for leaving me behind when I was so young.

585
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,766
At least

586
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,143
that's how I felt back then.

587
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,104
What about now?

588
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,692
Now I just…

589
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,362
miss her.

590
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,271
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

591
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,148
You should go inside.

592
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,275
After you leave.

593
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,915
You have to stare harder
if you want to burn a hole into his head.

594
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,461
How much did you see?

595
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,921
"After you leave."

596
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,673
About that much.

597
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,136
Are you out of your mind?

598
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,847
-That guy--
-Are you sure it's him?

599
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,642
I just don't think it's him.

600
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,186
We could consider that he may be psychic,

601
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,021
but he might not be the serial killer.

602
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,233
But the only explanation
is that the killer is psychic.

603
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,445
He's just too soft-hearted and nice
to be the killer.

604
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,114
Gwang-sik got hurt
while he was with Kim Seon-woo.

605
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,490
Gwang-sik…

606
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
He got hurt?

607
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,372
Why would you word it like that
and scare me?

608
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,791
Technically speaking,
Gwang-sik hurt himself.

609
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,293
It wasn't because of Seon-woo.

610
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,919
Whatever.

611
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,005
Gwang-sik still lost his power.

612
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,467
Do you want one?

613
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,801
No, thank you.

614
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,596
What if Seon-woo offered it?

615
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,597
I'd drink it.

616
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,182
Jeez.

617
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,267
Let me ask you something.

618
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,146
Do you really think
Kim Seon-woo isn't the killer?

619
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,648
I'm not 100% sure,

620
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,568
but maybe about 51% sure?

621
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,361
Why such a random number?

622
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,197
I'm still leaning toward trusting him.

623
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,364
On what grounds?

624
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,660
Serial killers are usually psychopaths.

625
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,038
But Seon-woo knows
how to empathize with people.

626
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,623
That's ridiculous.

627
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,960
I guess you wouldn't know
since you're the left-brain type

628
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,712
with psychopathic tendencies.

629
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,048
I'm very good at empathizing with people.

630
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,508
Sure you are.

631
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,134
Let's say I texted you,

632
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,221
"I had a drink by the breakwater
because I was feeling down."

633
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,555
How would you reply?

634
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,891
"It's dangerous to drink there.
You could have fallen in."

635
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,185
How about this?

636
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,896
"I went to my mom's grave today."

637
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,523
"Where's her grave?"

638
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,733
See? It's impossible to talk to you.

639
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,236
You have zero ability
to empathize with people.

640
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,404
Fine, let's do this.

641
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073
Give me one more.

642
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,784
This is the last one.

643
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,791
"I want to know

644
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,379
why my mom committed suicide."

645
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,032
What are you doing?

646
00:42:58,784 --> 00:42:59,743
I'm comforting you.

647
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,420
How is this comforting?

648
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,220
This is how you do it.

649
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,639
Like this.

650
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,558
See?

651
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,686
This is how you comfort someone.

652
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:49,251
MUJIN POLICE STATION

653
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,257
What are you doing here?

654
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,508
Were you waiting for me?

655
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,432
What's with your face?

656
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,018
My father gave that to you, didn't he?

657
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,814
You already know the answer.

658
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,108
Father thinks

659
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,361
Mi-ok didn't kill herself.

660
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,197
But to be honest, I'm not sure.

661
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,907
I've spent the past 17 years

662
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,243
thinking she killed herself.

663
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,787
But all of a sudden, she didn't?

664
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,122
It's confusing.

665
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,798
Here.

666
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,550
Wait in the car. I'll be right back.

667
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,892
Reinvestigate the places where
Park Seung-gil and Lee Ji-suk were killed

668
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,811
and where the streamer's body was dumped.

669
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,771
See if we missed anything.

670
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,648
But we already searched thoroughly.

671
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,733
Then search even more thoroughly!

672
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:58,779
A piece of fabric, a single lint.
Anything could be linked to the murders!

673
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,697
-Captain, I have something else--
-Be quiet!

674
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,369
When forensic science fails us,
we have to rely on legwork.

675
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,871
So charismatic.

676
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,085
Won Jong-muk.

677
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,839
Where's Won Jong-muk?

678
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,183
If we follow that data,

679
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,811
we'll find out what Mi-ok did,

680
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,481
who she met, what she found out,

681
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,900
and

682
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,403
why she died.

683
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,535
-Here, look at this.
-Okay.

684
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,455
-From here to there, right?
-Yeah.

685
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:54,084
This was the most valuable property
during Mujin's redevelopment wave.

686
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,796
Assemblyman Yoon Deok-hyeon
had bought all this land

687
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,716
for 100,000 won per pyeong
right before the redevelopment wave.

688
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,969
And when rumors spread about
Mujin becoming a special tourist zone,

689
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,931
he sold it all at a premium,
for two million won per pyeong.

690
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,559
If you look here, that's when your sister

691
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,228
started writing these articles.

692
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,897
I remember this.

693
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,692
Mi-ok told me to never let Father
buy any of these lands.

694
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,447
In the end, Mujin wasn't even considered
for a special tourist zone,

695
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,533
and the redevelopment plan
went down the drain.

696
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,077
As a result, the land prices
plummeted to the ground.

697
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,288
If you look over here,

698
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:35,000
your sister was the only person
who wrote articles

699
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,336
in favor of the victims back then.

700
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,379
And the people over here…

701
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,007
They were probably the people

702
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,219
she spent the most time with back then.

703
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,261
That's right.

704
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,764
I brought her a change of clothes
a few times.

705
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:52,309
She was practically living
with these people.

706
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,103
So where should we begin?

707
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,940
We should look for these people.

708
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,618
Thanks.

709
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:14,248
They couldn't have sold
those useless pieces of land,

710
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,500
so they probably still own them.

711
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,381
-What in the world…
-What's wrong?

712
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,217
One person owns all the land.

713
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,052
-Let me see.
-Here.

714
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,095
Oh, my gosh.

715
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,931
CHA JU-MAN

716
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,642
CHA JU-MAN

717
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,227
CHA JU-MAN

718
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,396
They all belong to Ju-man.

719
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,313
Right.

720
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,068
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE
FROM CHA JU-MAN

721
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:51,660
HERE LIES JUNG MI-OK

722
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:12,889
It's been a while

723
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,350
since I visited Mi-ok.

724
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:18,645
Did you leave those here?

725
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,522
I'm sorry.

726
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,944
I thought it was someone else.

727
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,032
I can't see well these days.

728
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,077
So you can't see well?

729
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,497
You should take good care of your eyes.

730
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:43,879
So that's why you took the donor list
from my campaign office.

731
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,507
Of course.

732
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,011
You only took it
because you couldn't see well.

733
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,722
And here I was thinking
you had ulterior motives.

734
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,560
Yes.

735
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,981
And that's why you had
Ye-bun return it the next day.

736
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,360
Now I get it.

737
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,364
I almost misunderstood you.

738
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:16,244
I'm glad we cleared up
that misunderstanding.

739
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,047
You should head home now.

740
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,801
No, I'm going to stay a little longer.

741
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,344
Come on now.

742
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:36,264
Just let me take you home.

743
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,893
It must've been exhausting coming here.

744
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,826
I parked my car way too far away.

745
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,745
We're almost there, sir.

746
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,332
-Keep going.
-Okay.

747
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:09,923
How did all this land become Ju-man's?

748
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,843
There's only one person
who hasn't sold his land.

749
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,012
Maybe we'll find out if we talk to him.

750
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,000
Hello?

751
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,002
Does Kim Seon-woo
have connections to Mujin?

752
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,962
What? That's a random question.

753
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,841
I heard his mom was from Mujin.

754
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,593
Has he ever lived in Mujin before?

755
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,429
He told me
this was his first time in Mujin.

756
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,806
I can't believe him.

757
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,224
Why?

758
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,684
Let me warn you one more time.

759
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,853
Don't meet with him ever again.

760
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,521
All right.

761
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,522
Bong Ye-bun.

762
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,776
Please don't.

763
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:22,996
So how did all that land
come to belong to Assemblyman Cha?

764
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,416
I had been told
the land was going to be redeveloped,

765
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,210
so I paid two million won for it.

766
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:32,255
But then the price dropped
to 200,000 won instead.

767
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,134
I invested all the money I had saved up
and even took out loans

768
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,220
in the hopes of the redevelopment.

769
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:42,015
So even if I sold the land then,
I would still have been left in debt.

770
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:46,603
With the land price plummeting,
I got dragged into the gutter.

771
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,148
Who would sell their land
when it can't even pay off their debts?

772
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,109
That's when Cha Ju-man
showed up out of the blue.

773
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,906
He said it'd be better to get out of debt
if I was going to be homeless anyway.

774
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:02,702
And then he started buying all the land
for 500,000 won per pyeong.

775
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,996
So why didn't you sell yours?

776
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,706
Come on.

777
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,668
How could I sell the land to that bastard?

778
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,421
He's the one who sweet-talked everyone
into buying the land,

779
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,632
acting as Assemblyman Yoon's minion.

780
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,009
Cha Ju-man was the one who told people

781
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:21,012
they'd hit the jackpot
once the land was redeveloped.

782
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,768
Do you know of a journalist
named Jung Mi-ok?

783
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,481
-This is the journalist, Ms. Jung.
-Yes.

784
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,026
She stood by our side until the end
and wrote articles for us too.

785
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:39,573
Is there anything else
you remember about her?

786
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,827
I only crossed paths with her a few times.

787
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,537
Right. Look.

788
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:51,293
She was the chairperson
of the emergency committee at the time.

789
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,545
She and Ms. Jung were like sisters.

790
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,338
Where is she now?

791
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,883
She turned out to be a bad one too.

792
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,218
-What?
-The word on the street is

793
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,222
she took a ton of money as compensation
and ran away to Seoul.

794
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,517
-To Seoul?
-Yes, to Seoul.

795
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,939
-See you.
-Thank you. It's gotten so much better.

796
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,358
-Have a nice day.
-Take care.

797
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,990
Ye-bun.

798
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,867
Hello, Mr. Cha.

799
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,994
We ran into each other
at your mom's grave.

800
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,288
Take care, Dr. Jung.

801
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,631
Ye-bun.

802
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,636
Could you hold me?

803
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,848
Grandpa.

804
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,364
All right. Careful.

805
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,912
Are you all right?

806
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,123
I'm fine.

807
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,939
I told you I could go by myself.

808
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,274
How are you so stubborn?

809
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,902
I take after Mi-ok, of course.
We're sisters.

810
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,446
What are you, a magnet?

811
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,115
Why are you clinging to me?

812
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,075
We've been apart for so long.

813
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,411
We need to use every opportunity
to be close.

814
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,578
Goodness.

815
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,623
Stop it.

816
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,959
I know you love it.

817
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,460
My windows aren't even tinted.

818
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,633
This seems to be it.

819
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,683
Are you sure it's here?

820
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,101
Yes, I'm sure.

821
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,104
Can I help you?

822
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:19,983
Isn't anyone living here?

823
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,819
The old lady went on a trip
with the senior citizens' center.

824
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,154
She's coming back tomorrow.

825
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,071
Tomorrow?

826
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,490
Yes. Why don't you come back tomorrow?

827
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,034
Okay.

828
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,496
What a nice lady.

829
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,875
Listen.

830
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,753
I'm going to spend the night here

831
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,047
and investigate some more.

832
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,299
You should start heading back now.

833
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,468
I'm not going back by myself.

834
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,804
Let me stay here too.

835
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,556
What are you talking about?

836
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,019
There are tons of
hotels and motels in Seoul.

837
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,441
Hyeon-ok!

838
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,358
Yeah?

839
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,569
For goodness' sake.

840
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,030
HOTEL GUNG J

841
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,076
Maybe we should have rented two rooms.

842
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,202
What for?

843
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,872
That would be a waste of money.
We just need to sleep here.

844
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,211
Are you going to wash up first?

845
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,213
No.

846
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,256
You go first.

847
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,093
Well…

848
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,513
Sleep tight then, okay?

849
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,016
What are you doing?

850
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,018
Would you rather sleep on the floor?

851
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,270
We can both sleep on the bed.

852
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,190
No, that's not right.

853
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,317
What's not right about it?

854
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,694
You're over 50. Don't be shy.

855
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,029
Still…

856
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,199
That's just not right. Good night.

857
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,785
Fine. I'm going to sleep down there too.

858
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,039
Then you sleep on the floor.
I'll sleep on the bed.

859
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,542
Me too.

860
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,086
I'm going to sleep up here too.

861
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,508
-Come on, go down.
-No, I'm not going to.

862
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,135
Go down, for Pete's sake.

863
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,011
-Go!
-Jong-muk.

864
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,513
-Oh, my!
-Oh, no.

865
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,307
You sleep on the floor. It'll be comfy.

866
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,871
What are you doing?

867
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,706
Take it off. Hey!

868
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,458
Take it off right now.

869
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,254
Are you insane?

870
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,924
Goodness gracious!

871
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,761
I had to do it so we could sleep
on the same bed together.

872
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,514
You're driving me nuts.

873
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,058
Jeez.

874
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,062
You must be so tired.

875
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,940
Let's go to sleep.

876
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,859
Man…

877
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,426
Jong-muk.

878
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,473
What's that noise?

879
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,474
I don't know.

880
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,312
Hyeon-ok!

881
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,813
The building's on fire!

882
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,232
What do we do?

883
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,942
For God's sake!

884
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:59,661
Why did you have to throw the key away?

885
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:04,207
You could have just slept on the bed
with me from the beginning!

886
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,959
Jong-muk.

887
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,627
It's over for me.

888
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,379
Save yourself.

889
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:10,547
Are you crazy?

890
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,507
I'm not leaving without you!

891
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,928
Don't clutch it that tight. It hurts!

892
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,688
Are these all the guests?

893
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,483
Some are still in there.

894
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,319
I think someone's coming out.

895
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,406
Jong-muk, this way!

896
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:46,749
Jong-muk.

897
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,793
Help!

898
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,968
What are you looking at?

899
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,435
All right…

900
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,772
Hurry up and cut this off him.

901
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,359
Do you happen to know
a student named Kim Seon-woo?

902
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,069
He graduated from here.

903
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,446
You mean Seon-woo?

904
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,282
Why are you asking about him?

905
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,200
He's a close friend of mine,

906
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,536
but I lost touch with him a few years ago.

907
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,496
I'm worried about him.

908
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,291
He recently dropped out of grad school.

909
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,542
Is that so?

910
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,754
Do you know why he dropped out?

911
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:34,213
I'm not sure.

912
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,508
The professor would know more than I do.

913
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,927
Our professor was very fond of him.

914
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,638
That's why he was a TA for so long.

915
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,556
The professor even helped him
with his thesis

916
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,017
and wrote him
recommendation letters too, but…

917
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,935
But?

918
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,854
He just dropped out all of a sudden.

919
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:55,234
Could you tell me when exactly he quit?

920
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,488
Let me think.

921
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,823
Oh, right. Just a moment.

922
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,454
There it is.

923
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,045
Seon-woo put these up

924
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,131
and quit school soon after.

925
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,300
That was in 2019, so 3 years ago.

926
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,636
LECTURE WITH ASSEMBLYMAN CHA JU-MAN
RETURNING TO FARMING AND RURAL AREAS

927
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:25,014
I see Assemblyman Cha Ju-man was here.

928
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,724
You mean the poster?

929
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,061
The students weren't interested,
but Seon-woo insisted on putting it up.

930
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:31,771
I see.

931
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,565
Do you know what the lecture was about?

932
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,693
You can probably watch it online.

933
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,738
Farming areas lack young energy right now.

934
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:44,492
The president of Mujin's
Youth Association is 60 years old.

935
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,869
The reason young people
don't move to farming areas

936
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,621
is because there are no jobs.

937
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,082
More specifically,

938
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,459
there are no jobs for young people.

939
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,796
But are jobs enough
to attract young people?

940
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,172
No.

941
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,174
Unless they want to work all the time.

942
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,385
They want to have fun after work.

943
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,847
Young people flock to entertainment
and convenience store areas.

944
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:10,143
Entertainment is as important as jobs.

945
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:11,978
Then what should we do?

946
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,605
We have to create jobs
and sources of entertainment

947
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,274
and then seduce them.

948
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,277
That's why we started…

949
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,738
THE SECOND ANNUAL PRAWN FESTIVAL

950
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,448
…the Mujin Prawn Festival.

951
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,992
Mujin has a population of 30,000,

952
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,494
and the festival attracts 50,000 visitors.

953
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,538
The festival will cause
more infrastructure

954
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,498
and residential spaces to be built.

955
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,459
Abandoned land will turn into

956
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:38,254
restaurants, malls, and even bars
where you can meet attractive strangers.

957
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,257
I see you like the last one a lot.

958
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,886
This is how we'll convince young people
to move to the rural areas.

959
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:49,682
In other words, developing the area
is how you attract young people there.

960
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,145
-This is it.
-Here?

961
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,235
Who is it?

962
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,945
Ma'am, you're home today.

963
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,741
-Hello.
-Hello.

964
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,117
Can I help you?

965
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,537
We're looking for someone.

966
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,081
A woman named Lee Eun-suk.

967
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,751
I heard she lived here
around ten years ago.

968
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,378
You mean the woman with her son?

969
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,963
Do you remember her?

970
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,173
Of course.

971
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,676
She rented the room across from us
for a long time.

972
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,388
She lived a tough life.

973
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,767
We heard she received

974
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,978
a ton of money as compensation in Mujin
and returned to Seoul rich.

975
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,647
Rich? Nonsense.

976
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,149
She got kicked out penniless.

977
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,235
When she arrived here,

978
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,111
her cheeks were all sunken

979
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,240
as if she'd been to hell and back.

980
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,325
Her son must have starved too.

981
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,454
The little thing basically scarfed down
the meal I made for him.

982
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,083
Do you know where she is now?

983
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,169
I wish I knew.

984
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,589
She asked me to watch her son
for a few days,

985
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,132
and that was it.

986
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,676
She never came back for her son.

987
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,471
I don't even know if she's dead or alive.

988
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,935
I kept him for about a year,

989
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,981
but I couldn't take care of him anymore,
so I sent him to a children's home.

990
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,652
I'll develop Mujin
so that young people can move there.

991
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:28,531
I'll turn it into a special tourist zone
so that young people can thrive there.

992
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,241
Just have faith in me and move to…

993
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,800
It's all right.

994
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,719
Not everyone would agree with me.

995
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:54,265
Making sure that Mujin can embrace
even people like him

996
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,685
is my dream.

997
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,945
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

998
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,156
Request backup and come to
Assemblyman Cha's office with the captain.

999
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,074
Hurry!

1000
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,243
I was there to kill Cha Ju-man.

1001
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,537
He deserves to suffer
the wrath of the gods.

1002
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,664
Why are you packing all of a sudden?

1003
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,749
-Jang-yeol. He disappeared.
-What?

1004
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,877
I hear you've been spending a lot of time
with Detective Moon.

1005
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,171
If you're that suspicious of him,
just touch him.

1006
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,381
A brief touch won't work.

1007
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,716
-Hello, Assemblyman Cha!
-So all you need

1008
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,592
is enough time to touch him?

1009
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,053
Mom didn't kill herself, did she?

1010
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,431
And you think Mr. Cha
had something to do with it.

1011
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,057
I'll be the one to take care of it,

1012
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,726
and I'll be the one to tie everything up.

1013
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:02,727
Breaking news.

1014
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,562
…was found dead.

1015
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,981
The murder weapon
is the same as the other murders.

1016
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,232
Everything points to him.

1017
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,109
-No visitors allowed.
-Get out of my way.

1018
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,737
Why won't anyone tell me anything?

1019
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:19,243
