00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,681
Ye-bun really does take after Mi-ok.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,850
Not only her looks

4
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,519
but also her personality.

5
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,563
So lively

6
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,024
and daring.

7
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,401
Mi-ok was exactly the same way.

8
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,030
And to think she broke your heart
by doing that to herself.

9
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,153
Grandpa.

10
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,411
Grandpa!

11
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,957
Grandpa.

12
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,583
Grandpa!

13
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,295
-Sir!
-Grandpa.

14
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,799
-Grandpa!
-Can you hear me?

15
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,800
Sir!

16
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,898
What should we do first?

17
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,861
We have to plan the funeral
and rent mourning clothes.

18
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,823
Or should we contact people first?

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:42,662
I signed up for a funeral service agency.
Should I call them first?

20
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,047
Auntie.

21
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,466
I'll look into it.

22
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,061
How was Mr. Jung
when he was brought to the hospital?

23
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,982
He'd already lost a lot of blood
due to the stab wound in his heart.

24
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,943
He was also unconscious,
so he went into emergency surgery.

25
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,910
What's happening?

26
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,002
I don't think

27
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,129
you'll be able to hold
the funeral right away.

28
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,423
Why not?

29
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,052
They'll need to do an autopsy
to determine the cause of death.

30
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,430
And since the case is still open,

31
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,726
they'll need to
investigate more on Dr. Jung

32
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,811
as he's still the murder suspect.

33
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,065
But you can tell them he's innocent.

34
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,193
That my grandpa isn't the killer.

35
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,820
There's a procedure to follow.

36
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,492
I guess we can't help it then.

37
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,535
Butâ€¦

38
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,455
I don't want to leave my grandpa

39
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,541
where he doesn't know anyone.

40
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,754
I know what it is like to be alone.

41
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,052
I won't let him stay there for long.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,232
MUJIN MEDICAL CENTER

43
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,734
NEUROSURGERY

44
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,155
Hello, I'm from the Violent Crimes Unit
at Mujin Police Station.

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,075
What do you mean, Parkinson's disease?

46
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,288
Mr. Jung Ui-hwan's disease
had progressed to stage three.

47
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,498
When he first came to our hospital,

48
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,293
he had hand tremors and rigidity.

49
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,462
He had trouble keeping his balance,

50
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,257
and he couldn't walk properly.

51
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,801
We slowed down
the progress with medication,

52
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,929
but I'm sure he had
a lot of discomfort in his daily tasks.

53
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,851
Would it have been hard for him
to hold things if he had hand tremors?

54
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,853
It was hard for him to even hold a pen

55
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,064
because he was
in the early stage of rigidity.

56
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,317
Then are you saying

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,819
that he couldn't have been
able to hold a weapon?

58
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,363
That is my medical opinion.

59
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,997
Do you think an elderly man
with Parkinson's disease

60
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,875
can stab a man in his twenties
dozens of times?

61
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,547
The old man couldn't move fast,
let alone walk properly.

62
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,633
So how could he have attacked
the victim who was on a motorcycle?

63
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,098
And how could someone
who couldn't even hold onto a pen

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,060
dump a 52 kg woman into the sea?

65
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,812
I don't think any of that is possible.

66
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,445
What if Assemblyman Cha Ju-man's murder
is unrelated to all the other cases?

67
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,489
What?

68
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,742
Compared to the other victims,

69
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,869
his wounds are much more well-aimed.

70
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,706
It might not be
the work of the same killer.

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,874
No.

72
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,876
The killer must have evolved
along the way.

73
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,464
We found that the wounds of the victims
got more meticulous with each murder,

74
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,257
although slightly.

75
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,177
There's only one killer.
It's the same guy.

76
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,012
So are you saying

77
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,723
that Assemblyman Cha
is also a victim of the serial killer

78
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,017
and that Mr. Jung isn't the killer?

79
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,062
Mr. Jung Ui-hwan
didn't kill Assemblyman Cha.

80
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,023
He was a witness who was killed
by the serial killer and framed.

81
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,691
But we can't ignore

82
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,736
that Mr. Jung had the motive
to kill Assemblyman Cha.

83
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,862
To avenge his daughter.

84
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,781
A motive that can't be ignored.

85
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,618
That's exactly what this guy
is trying to play us with!

86
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,537
He's starting to have fun now.

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,247
He'll be killing more people

88
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,208
and won't need any reason to kill anymore.

89
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,879
We can't play his game!

90
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,259
FUNERAL HALL
ENTRANCE

91
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,098
I rented the mourning clothes.

92
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,850
You can ask an employee for them.

93
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,021
I also scheduled the departure
for the procession and burial.

94
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,400
You can have a look and discuss it more
with the hospital staff.

95
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,196
And you'd need a funeral portrait.

96
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,783
See if you can find
a nice picture of your grandfather.

97
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,578
There probably isn't any.

98
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,914
He didn't like taking pictures.

99
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,505
He hated taking pictures.

100
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,051
When did he go
and have his funeral portrait taken?

101
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
Hey, Gwang-sik.

102
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
Come sit over here.

103
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:26,923
Come.

104
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
You're here early.

105
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,175
-Yeah.
-We are.

106
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,384
Yeah.

107
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,053
So you came with him.

108
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,096
-Hello.
-Yes.

109
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,349
Of course,
we're like two halves of a whole.

110
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,770
By the way,
when's the wedding going to be?

111
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,773
Soon.

112
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,735
If Dr. Jung were alive,

113
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,488
he would have gladly
officiated your wedding.

114
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,128
Dr. Jung!

115
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,424
Dr. Jung!

116
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,564
Come now.

117
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,649
You can't break down like this.

118
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,568
You're grieving the family even more.

119
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,737
I know this is inconsiderate of me,

120
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,781
but I just can't stop crying.

121
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,327
When I first moved here,

122
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,747
everyone gave me dirty looks
because I was a shaman.

123
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,043
Dr. Jung was the only one
who treated me like a normal person.

124
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,798
He was such a good person.

125
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,594
Still,

126
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,014
it's such a relief
that he cleared his name.

127
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,433
It's already tragic
that he passed away like that.

128
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,226
Imagine he was framed too.

129
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,269
Come on,

130
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,272
who here suspected him in the first place?

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,235
So what's going to happen now?

132
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,738
I heard the case will be reinvestigated.

133
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,451
Why are you getting up?

134
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,702
I should get going.

135
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,080
I have to repair
the milking machine early tomorrow.

136
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,041
Let's go.

137
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,584
But I'm not done eating yet.

138
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,711
Just get up.

139
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,546
What's the hurry?

140
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,089
We have to go.

141
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,304
-All right.
-See you.

142
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,305
-Take care.
-Bye.

143
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,966
Kim Seon-woo isn't here.

144
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,385
Right.

145
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,554
You're here, Detective Moon.

146
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,597
Hello.

147
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,101
Are you here by yourself?

148
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
Where's Kim Seon-woo?

149
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,648
I'm not sure.

150
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,817
I haven't seen him all day.

151
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,693
Is that so?

152
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,906
To be honest with you,

153
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:42,034
I can't explain right now
why Kim Seon-woo is the serial killer.

154
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,204
But it will be revealed soon.

155
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,291
So you want us
to keep an eye on him until that happens?

156
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,336
I won't lose him this time.

157
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:53,838
What?

158
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,173
You've been up to something without me?

159
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,801
Detective Na.

160
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm counting on you.

161
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,264
Yes, sir.

162
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,980
He's changed a lot
since he first came here.

163
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,815
How so?

164
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,025
At first, he was a douchebag.

165
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,070
But now he's just a bag, so to speak.

166
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
Jong-muk.

167
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,376
I just can't

168
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,087
understand my father.

169
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,801
If he thought Ju-man harmed Mi-ok
from the beginning,

170
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,804
why did he stick by him like that?

171
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,059
It would have been tough

172
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,853
trying to prove

173
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,980
that Mi-ok didn't kill herself.

174
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,276
And it would have been even tougher
to prove that Cha Ju-man killed her.

175
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,947
That's probably why
he stayed close to his side.

176
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:06,327
He must have investigated
the redevelopment cases

177
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,371
and looked for things
to hold against him to bring him down.

178
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,460
He must have been living in hell
all those years.

179
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,382
He was keeping all that pain to himself
and even got sick.

180
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,844
But he never said a word about it
to me or Ye-bun.

181
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,935
He was probably trying to protect you two.

182
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,395
He must have wanted

183
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,148
to take on the painful burden
of revenge by himself

184
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,527
so you and Ye-bun could live in peace.

185
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,112
I understand him.

186
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,993
My poor father.

187
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,436
What are you doing here?

188
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,231
You should get some sleep.

189
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,609
I'm okay.

190
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,322
Shouldn't you eat something?
You haven't eaten all day.

191
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,660
Ok-hui.

192
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,788
I've been thinkingâ€¦

193
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,667
about why I acquiredâ€¦

194
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,129
this power.

195
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,799
And I thinkâ€¦

196
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,636
my mom gave it to meâ€¦

197
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,848
so I could understand my grandpa.

198
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,394
Butâ€¦

199
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,439
I neverâ€¦

200
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,776
used my power on him.

201
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,361
Soâ€¦

202
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,948
I didn't even know he was sick.

203
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
All this time,

204
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,374
I thought he hated me.

205
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,295
But I was the one

206
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,672
who turned my back on him.

207
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,011
I should've touched him sooner.

208
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,557
I should have tried to understand him.

209
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,875
Yes, Detective Na.

210
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,711
What?

211
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,595
Kim Seon-woo isn't home?

212
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,140
-He's not at the workshop either.
-He quit his job too.

213
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,029
His things are still here,
so it doesn't seem like he ran.

214
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,782
He might have made it
look like that on purpose.

215
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,200
He's a smart guy.

216
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,995
What happens if he really did run away?

217
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,914
Then we'll have a mad dog out there.

218
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,964
There's nothing we can do
since Cha Ju-man died.

219
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,719
But I think it's only right

220
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:56,181
to give you
what your grandfather left behind.

221
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,478
I added to what your grandfather
had investigated.

222
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,273
With that, you'll have no trouble

223
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,318
revealing what kind of things
Cha Ju-man had been up to.

224
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,656
All you have to decide

225
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,452
is whether you want to or not.

226
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,505
There have been allegations
that the late Assemblyman Cha Ju-man

227
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,884
had been involved in a speculation scheme
regarding Mujin's redevelopment plans.

228
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,304
It has been revealed that he accumulated
immense wealth through this scheme

229
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,516
and that there was a mysterious death
in the process, causing an uproar.

230
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,977
The prosecution plans to launch
a full investigation,

231
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,898
including a search and seizure and summons
based on the obtained evidence.

232
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,776
CHIEF OF POLICE

233
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,362
From now on, the Major Crimes Division
will investigate the serial killing.

234
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:56,241
So don't get in their way
with your bullcrap sense of justice.

235
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,743
No, scratch that.

236
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,870
You have the face of a troublemaker.

237
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,165
I forbid your unit
from gathering in one place at all.

238
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,794
We can't do our jobs and help people
without gathering in one place though.

239
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,795
Why not?

240
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,379
Just do it online!

241
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,466
Still, that's not right.

242
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,135
You think so?

243
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,430
Would you rather
I kick a sinkhole into your knees?

244
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,059
What did the chief say?

245
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,061
It's just as we expected.

246
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,607
The Major Crimes Division
is taking on the serial killer case.

247
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,902
We are to focus on protecting
people's livelihoods.

248
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,244
But you knowâ€¦

249
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,915
A serial killer is a threat
to people's livelihoods, isn't it?

250
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,876
If life and death aren't
part of livelihood, then what is?

251
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,753
Listen up.

252
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,505
From now on,

253
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,216
our strategy is ELIS.

254
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,885
Externally livelihoods,
internally serial killing.

255
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,637
We protect people's livelihoods

256
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,514
while looking into the serial killing.

257
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,141
Understand?

258
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,564
THE THEFT OF AGRICULTURAL GOODS IS A CRIME

259
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,150
Hey, that's too tight.

260
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,067
Understood.

261
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,531
Were they able to track
Kim Seon-woo's phone?

262
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,992
No. It's been off since last night.

263
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,328
Check his credit card history too.

264
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,246
Yes, sir.

265
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,333
CHECKPOINT

266
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,797
Let it pass.

267
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,552
No credit card transactions.

268
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,804
Something's definitely fishy.

269
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,308
He's not using his phone or card
as if he's determined not to get caught.

270
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,435
What if he's left Mujin completely?

271
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,732
Secure the security camera footage
of Mujin Terminal.

272
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,692
Yes, sir.

273
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,764
You're here again?

274
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,681
Hello.

275
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,475
You must be tired.

276
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,644
I'm fine.

277
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,730
I can't seem to fall asleep, same as you.

278
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,607
Let's go in.

279
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,861
Come here.

280
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,280
Eat while there aren't any guests.

281
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,198
Sit.

282
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm fine. I don't have an appetite.

283
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,412
That doesn't matter.

284
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,290
You should still eat regularly.

285
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
I really don't feel like it.

287
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,681
I don't think she's eaten a single meal
since her grandfather passed away.

288
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,893
I'm starting to get worried.

289
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,663
Come with me.

290
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,507
I asked Ok-hui,

291
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,467
and she said you liked this.

292
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,473
You have to eat
to have energy for the funeral.

293
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,112
Touch me.

294
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,534
You probably won't see clearly.

295
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:12,748
You said the memories are low quality
and blurry when you're not feeling well.

296
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,169
We can't catch the killer that way.

297
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,715
What happened to your grandfather
isn't your fault.

298
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,841
It's the killer's.

299
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,802
Don't blame yourself.

300
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,555
Eat up.

301
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,514
Eat this

302
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,142
and help me catch

303
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,519
whoever did this to your grandfather.

304
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,712
The departure is at daybreak, right?

305
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,089
I'll be here early.

306
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,466
You don't have to do that.

307
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,593
I want to.

308
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,725
Eat well and get enough sleep
so we can catch the killer.

309
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,106
Detective.

310
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,740
Thank you

311
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:33,578
for clearing my grandfather's name.

312
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,092
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

313
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,386
Maybe he really is the killer.

314
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,307
Why else would he disappear
right after the incident?

315
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,185
How many times did I tell you
that something was fishy about him?

316
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,439
But you kept talking nonsense
about aliens and psychics.

317
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,776
How could I have believed you
without any evidence?

318
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,196
What if a mad dog really is out there,
just like Detective Moon said?

319
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,657
If Kim Seon-woo is the killer,

320
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,951
his final target
would have been Cha Ju-man.

321
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,122
Now he wouldn't need to
kill anymore, don't you think?

322
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,207
What if this is the beginning?

323
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,335
He's already killed people
who weren't his target.

324
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,464
He could keep killing random people
for the same reason he killed the others.

325
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,594
You're so pessimistic about everything.

326
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,221
I was trying to be positive.

327
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,348
What's there to be positive
about a serial killing?

328
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,434
All right.

329
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,061
Then he'll keep killing more people,

330
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,230
and you and I will get fired.

331
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,774
You'll become a housewife

332
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,903
and chase after
your husband's lovers all the time.

333
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,030
Sounds great.

334
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,450
Detective Moon, let's think positively.

335
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,453
If we're sure
that Kim Seon-woo fled Mujin,

336
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,371
then we should tell
the Major Crimes Division.

337
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,833
Finding and stopping him comes first.

338
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,669
There's not much going on here either.

339
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,297
Yes, I'll be joining you guys soonâ€¦

340
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,549
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,514
Jang-yeol.

342
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
Kim Seon-woo is here.

343
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,496
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,668
I'm not even dressed properly.

345
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,464
Have you eaten yet?

346
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,180
Here.

347
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,822
I've been away to look for my mom.

348
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,706
They found an unidentified body
that resembled her.

349
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,296
It's always been like this.

350
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,968
I run over, thinking that this time
it could really be my mom.

351
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,346
And every time, it's not her.

352
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,769
But I still can't seem to give up.

353
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,692
Whether it was
a psychiatric hospital or a morgue,

354
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,778
I ran over as soon as I heard
they had someone who resembled her.

355
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,326
"What did my mom and Iâ€¦

356
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,996
do so wrong?"

357
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,084
"Who should I blame?"

358
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,340
That's when I met Assemblyman Cha.

359
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,889
My family was living in misery,

360
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,809
but he was smiling.

361
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,940
I wanted to kill him.

362
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,574
But once I got here,

363
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,036
I didn't know what to do.

364
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,831
"Would killing him

365
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,417
bring my mom back?"

366
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,294
"Would killing this assholeâ€¦

367
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,881
make my life any better?"

368
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,346
He's finally dead.

369
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,102
But nothing's changed.

370
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,565
I still don't have my mom with me,

371
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,110
and my lifeâ€¦

372
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,739
hasn't gotten any better.

373
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,793
It will

374
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,003
get better now.

375
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,614
What are you doing here?

376
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,535
I'm on a walk.

377
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,829
You came all the way here on a walk?

378
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:12,625
Yes, I sleep less and less as I get older.

379
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,711
I started walking, and I ended up here.

380
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,840
Why are you still up?

381
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,508
It's late.

382
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm throwing out the trash.

383
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,181
I'll take care of this for you.

384
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,807
No, I'm good.

385
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,601
It's no problem.

386
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,019
-I'll throwâ€¦
-Come onâ€¦

387
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,020
Oh, no.

388
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,066
Look what happened.

389
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,568
I'm so sorry.

390
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,612
Your pants got dirty.

391
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,655
I'll brush the dust off for you.

392
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,948
It got all over here.

393
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,869
My goodness, it's all dirty.

394
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,953
It'sâ€¦

395
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,673
I'll get going now.

396
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,717
Ae-ran is waiting for me.

397
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,222
See you.

398
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,275
-Detective Moon.
-Yes?

399
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,028
-I have something to tell you.
-What is it?

400
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,073
Someone tried to kill
Assemblyman Cha recently.

401
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,616
Assemblyman Cha?

402
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,368
Who did?

403
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,286
It was the shaman.

404
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,539
-The shaman?
-Yes.

405
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,083
A few days before Assemblyman Cha died,

406
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,752
I saw the shaman
go into Assemblyman Cha's office

407
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,045
with a knife in his hand.

408
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,089
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

409
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:45,635
I even touched his leg
just now to be sure.

410
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,595
I'm certain of it.

411
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,889
Did you see his memories
on the day of the murder?

412
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,350
No, I didn't see that much.

413
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,770
I just saw him follow Assemblyman Cha
into his office with a rose knife.

414
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,647
And behind him wasâ€¦

415
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,649
What was behind him?

416
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,411
Is what you just said true?

417
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,538
-That's--
-I didn't ask you.

418
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,000
Did you really witness it?

419
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,296
Yes.

420
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,216
What are you doing?

421
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,976
What are you looking for?

422
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,228
What's going on?

423
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,314
I don't know.

424
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,444
The knife isn't here.

425
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,201
Do you recognize this knife?

426
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,662
Yes. It'sâ€¦

427
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,080
Where did you put it?

428
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,665
Excuse me?

429
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,792
Mr. Park Jong-bae.

430
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,377
You're under arrest as the suspect

431
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,254
for the murders of Cha Ju-man
and Jung Ui-hwan.

432
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,172
What?

433
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,424
Waitâ€¦

434
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,969
Wait, butâ€¦

435
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:32,909
Wait.

436
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,913
So did the shaman kill
Assemblyman Cha and Dr. Jung?

437
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,052
What were you doing
on the night of November 1?

438
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,263
What did I do that day?

439
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,808
What did Iâ€¦

440
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,270
I don't remember.

441
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,773
Do you want me to remind you?

442
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,860
You went to Cha Ju-man's office
to kill him, didn't you?

443
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,531
There's a witness who saw you that day.

444
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,741
A witness?

445
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,119
I saw him going into the officeâ€¦

446
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,996
He said you were holding a knife.

447
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,790
The same knife as this.

448
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,042
It is the same one, butâ€¦

449
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,169
After you failed that day,

450
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,213
you went back there
and killed him, didn't you?

451
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,757
No, it wasn't me.

452
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,093
What were you doing
on the night of the murder?

453
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,849
I don't know.

454
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,351
You don't know? So you've got no alibi.

455
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,855
Then where's the knife from that day?

456
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,065
You don't know that either?

457
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,154
You killed Assemblyman Cha
and put the knife in Mr. Jung's hand!

458
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,655
No, I didn't.

459
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,906
Then where is this knife?

460
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,576
Iâ€¦

461
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,537
I threw it away.

462
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,621
You threw it away?

463
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,581
Where?

464
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,173
What happens if they can't find the knife?

465
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,134
That would mean that the knife
Dr. Jung was holding at the scene

466
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,802
belongs to the shaman.

467
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,971
Because the shaman's knife
wasn't at his house.

468
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,141
It's quite ironic.

469
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,020
If they find the knife,
the shaman's innocent.

470
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,731
And if they don't,
it means he's the killer.

471
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,025
And that would mean
that Kim Seon-woo wasn't the killer.

472
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,070
We've been working in vain.

473
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,613
It's not the shaman.

474
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
It doesn't fit with our deduction.

475
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,911
He went there with a weapon to kill him.

476
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,287
The fact is indisputable.

477
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,997
There's something more reliable.

478
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,583
If this is about
that psychic nonsense again--

479
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,001
I'm telling you the truth.

480
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,546
The shaman's alibi has already been proven
in the previous victims' cases.

481
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,465
Okay, so by who?

482
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,767
By Dr. Bong.

483
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,185
What?

484
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,981
She has the ability
to see other people's past.

485
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,608
It's called psychometry.

486
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,613
Detective Moon!

487
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,617
-Oh, come on.
-I'm sorry.

488
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,160
Goodness gracious.

489
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,296
Detective Moon is right.

490
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:36,008
I can see people's past

491
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,886
by touching their butts.

492
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,974
Butts?

493
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,102
That's absurd.

494
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,149
You spied on
your husband's lover illegally.

495
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,695
But that's no news, is it?

496
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,490
Dr. Bong, I feel like you've lost it a bit

497
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,118
since you started hanging out
with Detective Moon.

498
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,294
You went to a motel in Seoul
with my aunt and wore handcuffs.

499
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,631
I didn't wear handcuffs.

500
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,053
I believe you completely.

501
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,346
No, I'm good.

502
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,765
Go over there.

503
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:31,105
It's true that Mr. Park
was at the office with a knife.

504
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,025
But he didn't go inside.

505
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,445
I stopped him,
and we left together with the knife.

506
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,947
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

507
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,618
I didn't tell you
because nothing happened in the end.

508
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,496
Then do you know why the shaman
tried to kill Assemblyman Cha?

509
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,249
Yes.

510
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,543
Actually,

511
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,254
Mr. Parkâ€¦

512
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,715
JUNG UI-HWAN
PARKINSON'S DISEASE

513
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,678
So the shaman
had the same motive as Kim Seon-woo.

514
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,850
Mr. Park really isn't the killer.

515
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,602
We don't know that.

516
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,188
If he returned home with the knife
that day as you said,

517
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,065
it should've been there in his house.

518
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,567
But it wasn't.

519
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,737
And he's unable to prove his alibi
for the day of the murder.

520
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,949
Don't be so quick to side with him.

521
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:28,079
I'm saying that Mr. Park
isn't the one who killed my grandpa.

522
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,455
I wasn't making a quick judgment.

523
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,209
I want to catch the killer
more than anyone.

524
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,463
But I don't want an innocent person
to get hurt in the process.

525
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,053
Let meâ€¦

526
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,974
touch Mr. Park's butt.

527
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,811
Let me see him.

528
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,313
Wait, soâ€¦

529
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,983
All we have to do is let you see him?

530
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,959
"I'm working late today."

531
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,088
"I think he's the killer,

532
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,882
but there's no murder weapon."

533
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,175
There's no weapon yet.

534
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,052
How did you know that?

535
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,972
I can read what he's typing
by looking at where his fingers are

536
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,765
on the keyboard.

537
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,683
Wait.

538
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,730
"I ordered ox bone soup for dinner."

539
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,231
"Don't wait up."

540
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,150
"Smiley face. Heart."

541
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,192
Oh, give me a break.

542
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,320
Where did you learn to do that?

543
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,823
I figured it out on my own
while spying on my husband.

544
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,617
He never calls his lover
when he's at home.

545
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,577
They text.

546
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,661
Wait.

547
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,915
-It won't take long.
-"It won't take long."

548
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,293
"I'll question him all night
and find out."

549
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,756
You can hear him?

550
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,717
Of course not. I read his lips.

551
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,262
My husband always calls his lover
when he takes out the trash.

552
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,139
I'm getting annoyed again.

553
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,018
Who's the psychic here?

554
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,271
He said he'd question him,

555
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,565
so I bet the shaman's
in the interrogation room.

556
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,318
How do we sneak in there?

557
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:27,448
If we go in there and get caught,
we'll all be fired.

558
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,117
Ox bone soup.

559
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,744
He said he ordered ox bone soup.

560
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,416
DELIVERY

561
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,136
These cheaters have been getting
more and more careful.

562
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,847
They don't open their doors
unless I'm disguised to this extent.

563
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,432
This is amazing.

564
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,602
I kind of get why your husband is cheating

565
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,396
now that I'm seeing you like this.

566
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,856
-This is just amazing.
-Thank you, sir.

567
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,569
We combed through the mountain,
but there was no knife.

568
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,490
You can't clear your name
unless it's found.

569
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,575
There's no other knife, is there?

570
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,870
The one found at the scene
is yours, isn't it?

571
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,831
It really isn't.

572
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,542
What?

573
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,127
Ox bone soup delivery.

574
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,214
-Put it here.
-Yes, sir.

575
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:30,678
I'll do it. You can go.

576
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,680
It's included in the price.

577
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,395
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

578
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,188
I'm such a klutz.

579
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,816
I'll give you a sausage for free.

580
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,833
Dr. Bong.

581
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,626
Detective Moon.

582
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,378
What do I do?

583
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,255
For goodness' sake.

584
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,431
You're the one in charge
of the serial killer case, right?

585
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,308
You're Detective Kang.

586
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,934
Yes, I am.

587
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,437
I'm the captain
of the Violent Crimes Unit.

588
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,397
We've been investigating
this case until now.

589
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,940
I know.

590
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,695
I've been meaning to talk to you about
something extremely important.

591
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,323
What is it?

592
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,701
To tell you the truth,
I'm very sensitive to cold.

593
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,204
What does that have to do with anything?

594
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,122
This is frustrating.

595
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,834
You see, I'm sensitive to cold.

596
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,172
All right.

597
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,549
Then let's talk some other time
at a warmer place.

598
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,592
Hold on.

599
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,222
What he means

600
00:41:56,305 --> 00:42:00,184
is that he's prepared to hang up
his uniform over telling you this.

601
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,354
It's a phrase used in Chungcheong-do
during the winter.

602
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,398
What is this about?

603
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,401
From now on, you are

604
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,322
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.

605
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,365
Excuse me?

606
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,535
The only way for you now is up.

607
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,162
So what is it you want to tell me?

608
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,331
Do you go to church?

609
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,124
Church? Why are you asking me that?

610
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,585
He wants to know if he can trust you.

611
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,381
So what is it that you want to tell me?
Just get to the point.

612
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,715
Soâ€¦

613
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,176
Mr. Park, listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

614
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,678
I told you about my special power, right?

615
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,139
I'm actually psychic.

616
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,642
What do you mean?

617
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,312
I can see people's past
by touching their butts.

618
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,064
So I have to touch your butt right now.

619
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,524
Whether you believe me or not,

620
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,943
this is the only way
to save you right now.

621
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,696
-What?
-Hurry. We don't have much time.

622
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,655
How?

623
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,032
Like this?

624
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:57,950
Yes.

625
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,712
Mr. Park.

626
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,342
Is this it?

627
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,052
No. This is the other night.

628
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,470
I don't have time for this.

629
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,472
The night of the murderâ€¦

630
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,141
BROTHERS' RICE CAKE SHOP

631
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,440
You moron! Do you have a death wish?

632
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,172
You're late, Mr. Kim.

633
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,971
It wasn't me, right?

634
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,182
-No.
-See?

635
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,809
I really am innocent.

636
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,437
Detective Moon,
please tell them it wasn't me.

637
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,064
They won't believe me.

638
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,649
Then what am I supposed to do?

639
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,734
You met Seon-woo that day, right?

640
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,486
Yes, I did.

641
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,282
We were supposed to meet
at his workshop that day.

642
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,867
Tell that to the detective.

643
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,494
Then your alibi will check out.

644
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,958
Why are you miming golf
and not saying anything?

645
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,669
What is this?

646
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,671
He's saying you swung and missed today.

647
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,633
You've offended him,
so he's not going to tell you.

648
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,937
Detective, I remembered something.

649
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,024
I met someone on the day of the murder.

650
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,362
He almost died

651
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,240
-while jaywalking that night.
-You moron!Do you have a death wish?

652
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,535
The driver cursed the crap out of him.

653
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,161
When was that?

654
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,122
Do you remember the time?

655
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,957
Let's see.

656
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,959
That wasâ€¦

657
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,004
We had just finished
making bean-powder rice cakes,

658
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,549
so it would have been around eight.

659
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,466
Yes, that's right.

660
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,094
Mr. Park and I were to meet
at my workshop that night.

661
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,514
He was sleeping on the couch
when I arrived.

662
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,516
Do you remember what time it was?

663
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,393
It was around nine.

664
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,154
MUJIN POLICE STATION

665
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,288
Dr. Bong.

666
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,000
It must have been tough. Have some tofu.

667
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,883
Could you actually make me
a stew with this instead?

668
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,677
I'm craving spicy food
after a rough night.

669
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,554
Just eat it.

670
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,807
So that you don't come back here.

671
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,402
Thank you so much, Dr. Bong.

672
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:24,156
I remembered meeting Mr. Kim,
thanks to you.

673
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,783
To think I almost went to prison
on false charges.

674
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,454
But how did you not remember that?

675
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,165
This all happened so fast

676
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,917
that I was out of it and scared.

677
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:41,465
Plus, I wasn't sure if I really met him
because I was half-asleep at the time.

678
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,302
Was there anything strange
about him that night?

679
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,970
About Mr. Kim?

680
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,349
Not really.

681
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,684
I see.

682
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,810
Come to think of it,

683
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,146
he was a bit late.

684
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,814
How late?

685
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,943
We were supposed to meet at 8:30,

686
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,237
but he showed up around nine.

687
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
Why was he late?

688
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,659
I don't know.

689
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,764
It's a 30-minute walk
from his workplace to the workshop.

690
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,225
We were supposed to meet at 8:30,

691
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,977
but he showed up around nine.

692
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,688
That leaves an extra 30 minutes.

693
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,648
Did he stop by somewhere?

694
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,862
Kim Seon-woo
left the convenience store at eight.

695
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,581
If he had stopped by here,

696
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,375
it would have been 8:20.

697
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,033
It's 8:50.

698
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,868
But he arrived at nine.

699
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:36,705
Ten minutes is enough time
to kill both Cha Ju-man and Dr. Jung.

700
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,877
What are you doing here?

701
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,840
On the night of the murder,

702
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,343
you were to meet Mr. Park
at your workshop, right?

703
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,094
Yes.

704
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,181
You met him at nine, correct?

705
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,850
It probably was.

706
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,228
But you left
the convenience store at eight.

707
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,359
It's a 30-minute walk to the workshop,
but you met Mr. Park at nine.

708
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,486
That leaves an extra 30 minutes.

709
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,450
Did you stop by
Cha Ju-man's office or something?

710
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,246
That does fit the time frame perfectly.

711
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,668
Am I wrong?

712
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,837
You're right.

713
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:30,926
That night,

714
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,304
I walked Dr. Jung

715
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,849
to Assemblyman Cha's office.

716
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,019
He seemed to have trouble walking.

717
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,898
Usually, it takes 20 minutes

718
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,734
to get to Cha Ju-man's office
from the convenience store.

719
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,569
You probably know that already.

720
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,867
Dr. Jung had an especially hard time
walking that night,

721
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,328
so it took ten extra minutes.

722
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,332
And that's why it was nine
when I arrived here.

723
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,502
So why didn't you mention that?

724
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,089
You're already suspecting me.

725
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,633
Would you have believed me

726
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,553
if I had told you I was there that night?

727
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,809
You would have pinned me as the killer
one way or another.

728
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:22,978
I'll believe

729
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,063
what you just said.

730
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,192
But there's one thing I need you to do.

731
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:30,861
What is it?

732
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,656
Sitting on The Butt of Truth?

733
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,830
Why do you want me to sit there so badly?

734
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,582
Could it beâ€¦

735
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,251
that my assumption is correct?

736
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:52,507
Are you going to make Dr. Bong
touch my butt?

737
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,635
That's a great guess.

738
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,555
Or did you know about it
from the beginning?

739
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,769
I wondered why the two of you
were hanging out together.

740
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,063
"Is she helping Detective Moon

741
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,816
with some kind of investigation?"

742
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,780
"But why butts of all places?"

743
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,948
It makes no sense.

744
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:20,327
I'll let you in on a secret.
I have a special power.

745
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,205
Who would have known

746
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,501
that Dr. Bong can perform psychometry
to figure out who the killer is

747
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,920
by touching butts?

748
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,007
How smart of you.

749
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:37,552
And that means
you obviously won't accept my offer.

750
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,640
I'll do it.

751
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,519
Dig through my past

752
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,979
all you want.

753
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,950
It's okay, Dr. Bong.

754
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:02,077
I'm sorry.

755
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,845
Dr. Jung, are you okay?

756
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,764
Do you need help?

757
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,864
Going up.

758
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,658
Be careful, sir.

759
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,410
Thank you.

760
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,092
You're late, Mr. Kim.

761
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,222
I told you that I'm not selling it.

762
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,892
If we build a resort on your landâ€¦

763
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,852
I'll give you two million won per pyeong.

764
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:11,021
Then let me have a talk with Gwang-sik.

765
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,608
Sir!

766
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,443
You have to take this call.

767
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,905
-Who is it?
-The representative of the Central Party.

768
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,365
Hello, Cha Ju-man speaking.

769
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,249
Seon-woo was telling the truth.

770
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,919
He walked my grandpa there and left.

771
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,504
And I took a look
at the night of the meteor shower too.

772
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,465
He was by the pillar

773
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,383
but not at the location
Gwang-sik told us about.

774
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,762
And he left the barn
a little before the meteor shower.

775
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,475
Seon-woo's not psychic,
nor is he the killer.

776
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,687
Maybe he used some kind of power
to manipulate what you saw.

777
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,358
Neither Gwang-sik nor I have
that kind of ability.

778
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,737
If it's not Kim Seon-woo,

779
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,989
then who could it be?

780
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,877
I don't have a suspect anymore.

781
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,423
1. THE KILLER IS PSYCHIC
2. THE KILLER KNOWS BONG YE-BUN IS PSYCHIC

782
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,592
Where did I go wrong?

783
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,099
Were they perhaps separate killings
and not part of a serial murder?

784
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:31,726
No.

785
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,355
The stab wounds have gotten neater,
but that just means he's evolving.

786
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,482
It's clear that he stabbed them
with his eyes closed.

787
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,988
He couldn't have found that place
unless he was psychic.

788
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,493
He definitely used psychometry
on Bong Ye-bun.

789
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:53,540
2. THE KILLER KNOWS BONG YE-BUN IS PSYCHIC

790
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,754
In any case, my theory still stands.

791
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,507
This is definitely a serial murder case,

792
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,092
and the killer is psychic.

793
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,563
Are you going out?

794
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,273
I'm going on a house call.

795
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,066
Why don't you take a few days off?

796
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,778
Grandpa wouldn't have taken
any days off, would he?

797
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:26,322
Of course not.

798
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,658
See you later.

799
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,460
Hello?

800
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,377
Dr. Bong.

801
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,588
Seon-woo.

802
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,757
How did you know my number?

803
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,468
It was on the business card
you gave me a while ago.

804
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,552
This is my number.

805
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,722
Okay.

806
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,307
Are you going on a house call?

807
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,266
Yes.

808
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,478
How did you know?

809
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:00,065
There are a lot you can find out
without having to touch butts.

810
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,520
Thanks.

811
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,979
I'll get going then.

812
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,024
Actuallyâ€¦

813
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:43,942
Yes?

814
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,152
Can I ask you something?

815
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:53,451
You didn't let me touch you last time
because you knew I was psychic.

816
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,912
Why did you let me touch you this time?

817
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,000
Back then,

818
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,754
I didn't want you to find out
that I was having bad thoughts.

819
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,758
You thought I was a good person,

820
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,553
so I didn't want to disappoint you.

821
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,239
Dr. Bong!

822
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,324
Come and have some fruit.

823
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,742
Okay. Thank you.

824
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:40,748
-Thank you.
-It's nothing.

825
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,422
Should you be working so soon
after what happened?

826
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,467
If I take a break,
who will take care of the animals?

827
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,762
The cows seem to like you so much.

828
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,723
Is it because you're psychic?

829
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,392
Excuse me?

830
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,395
Gwang-sik actually told me.

831
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,898
He doesn't keep anything from me.

832
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,110
I heard you have the same power as him.

833
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,236
I do.

834
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,697
This is where I first got my power.

835
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,909
There was a meteor shower
while I was treating Geumsil.

836
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,120
Can you see what people are thinking too?

837
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,330
No.

838
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,124
I can only see what happened in the past.

839
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:29,964
Then would you be able to help me
find something I lost?

840
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,424
Something you lost?

841
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,636
Gwang-sik bought me a gold ring,

842
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,805
but I can't remember
where I put it at all.

843
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,476
I can't bring myself
to tell Gwang-sik that I lost it.

844
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:46,814
So I've been turning down his offer
to massage my legs these days.

845
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,900
I'd love to help.

846
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,027
Thank you.

847
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,695
Thenâ€¦

848
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,536
What are you doing?

849
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,250
Why are you trying to touch her butt?

850
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:07,835
I'm sorry.

851
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,504
Why are you so upset?

852
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,047
We were just goofing around.

853
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,299
There's no time to goof around!

854
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,301
Dr. Bong is busy working.

855
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,346
Don't bother her and go inside. Go.

856
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,065
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

857
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,443
Bong!

858
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,988
Were you on a house call?

859
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,073
You should have called me.

860
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,033
Seon-woo gave me a ride.

861
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:40,952
What?

862
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,996
So you think it's safe
to get closer with him now?

863
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,039
It's not like that.

864
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:48,585
What's wrong? Did something happen?

865
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:53,548
It's just that Gwang-sik
was acting a bit strange.

866
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,134
What did he do?

867
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,512
He didn't let me touch Ae-ran's butt.

868
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,724
Could there be something
he doesn't want me to see?

869
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,227
Of course!

870
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,063
They're a new couple.

871
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,065
Everything you see
would have been R-rated.

872
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,027
Is that why?

873
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,866
Anyway,

874
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,494
if it's not Mr. Park or Seon-woo,
who could it be?

875
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,872
The silhouette Gwang-sik saw.

876
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,583
He's the third psychic and the killer.

877
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,419
So why can't you tell who that is?

878
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,171
I know you have a keen eye.

879
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,756
I didn't see it.

880
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,842
It's something Gwang-sik saw
when he touched my leg andâ€¦

881
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:42,722
What?

882
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,858
Detective!

883
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:54,942
What is it now?

884
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,697
What if the killer
isn't the third psychic?

885
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,158
No, what if there is no third psychic?

886
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:05,119
What? Explain so I can understand.

887
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,664
What if

888
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,625
everything Gwang-sik said was a lie?

889
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,420
What if there are only two psychics

890
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,214
and that silhouette never existed?

891
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:18,925
What if everything we've done so far

892
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,678
was dictated by what Gwang-sik told us?

893
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,971
From what I saw,

894
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,807
he reached about here.

895
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,559
Yes, he seemed to reach about here.
So he's taller than me

896
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,603
-but shorter than Detective Moon.
-He was the one

897
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,522
-He's definitely on the slim side.
-who saw the silhouette

898
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,148
and estimated the killer's height.

899
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,901
By doing so, he cleverly got himself
off the suspect list.

900
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,363
He does seem similar
to the silhouette I saw.

901
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,240
He was also the one
who accused Kim Seon-wooâ€¦

902
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,491
I saw the shamanâ€¦

903
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,327
-â€¦and the shaman of being the killer.
-with a knife in his hand.

904
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,038
What ifâ€¦

905
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,791
we've been played by him

906
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,918
this whole time?

907
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,601
-Oh, you're badly hurt.
-Don't touch me!

908
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,571
-Gwang-sik, I'll be in touch!
-Ae-ran!

909
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:27,160
He also held a deeper grudge
against Ji-suk than anyone.

910
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,124
Jeon Gwang-sik is psychic.

911
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,835
Jeon Gwang-sik knows
Bong Ye-bun is psychic.

912
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,171
Jeon Gwang-sik
hides his crimes from Bong Ye-bun

913
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,423
by keeping his eyes closed.

914
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,924
Does this meanâ€¦

915
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,844
Jeon Gwang-sik is the serial killer?

916
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:49,891
Please be on your way.

917
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,685
I was going to.
I have a lot of deliveries to make.

918
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,520
ASSEMBLYMAN CHA'S OFFICE

919
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,401
A BETTER MUJIN! CENTER OF TOURISM!

920
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,126
Can I help you?

921
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,837
I'm here to deliver milk.

922
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,259
Don't bring it anymore.

923
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,886
There's no one to drink it anyway.

924
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,346
Is that so?

925
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:46,674
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

926
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,718
We just had another murder.

927
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,219
The murder weapon
should still be in the house.

928
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,679
He could have thrown it out at daybreak.

929
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,514
I'm going to go check on something.

930
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,558
Track Jeon Gwang-sik's location for me.

931
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:56,475
Excuse me.

932
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,522
You're making me
suspect you all over again.

933
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,858
The serial killer is psychic too.

934
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,278
Then you don't know
exactly what kind of power he has?

935
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,864
I might be the killer's next target.

936
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,157
Bong Ye-bun's in danger.

937
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,578
Who's there?

938
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:20,207
