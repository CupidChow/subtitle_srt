1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,933
Is it that good?

3
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,812
Considering I just almost died,
of course it is.

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,647
So then,

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,109
what do you see
when you touch someone's butt?

6
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,571
It seems like

7
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,783
I can only see
the footage they let me see.

8
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,743
So you have no control?

9
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,163
I do get to choose from
the different footage that they show me.

10
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,998
What is it, cable TV?

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,836
Can you choose to see what happened
at a specific point in time?

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,088
That would be amazing.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,508
Do you mean there's really
nothing you can control?

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,637
When Spider-Man got his powers,
he tested a bunch of things out.

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,183
When it comes to butts,
you can poke, grab, or knead them.

16
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,559
Haven't you tried any of that?

17
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,105
Do you

18
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,191
never use your brain?

19
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,652
-I do.
-For what?

20
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,156
To think about how to make money.

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,157
Stop eating.

22
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,742
-Wait--
-No more food for you.

23
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,579
Are butts dough or what?

24
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,289
Why would I knead them?

25
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,629
What?

26
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,464
Are you here to kneel at my feet?

27
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,426
Let's get things straight.

28
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,053
You were both right and wrong.

29
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,974
There was a woman.

30
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,768
But it turned out to be my boyfriend.

31
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,103
What?

32
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,856
They said they were meant to be
a woman or something.

33
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,275
Everything's fine now.

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,193
We agreed to just be friends.

35
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,991
What's with your neck?
Did something happen to you?

36
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,910
Oh, it's nothing.

37
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,955
Are you okay?

38
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,958
I can always find another guy.

39
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,378
But seriously, how did you know?

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,385
I don't know
if I should believe you or not.

41
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,638
But I'll sacrifice my butt
for the sake of your power.

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,726
Here we go.

43
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,357
You'd look better in peach than red.

44
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,943
Mr. Park. Are you on your way
to see the meteors?

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,403
MacArthur was a five-star general.

46
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,779
I'll get more powerful…

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,947
You spread the word for me.

48
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,907
Hey.

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,701
The last thing I saw
was you selling snacks to the shaman.

50
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,453
That was on the night
of the meteor shower.

51
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,996
That was a week ago.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,458
So poking must show me
what's happened in the past week.

53
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,396
What are you looking at?

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,857
If you don't want your ass kicked,
just keep walking.

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,234
You're asking for it.

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
Get her!

57
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,287
You beat up kids again.

58
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,498
-You can see that too?
-When was that?

59
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,375
Three or four months ago.

60
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,335
Three or four months ago?

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,008
Ok-hui.

62
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,511
Why did you drink so much
when you're such a lightweight?

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,554
It's been so long
since I've been to a club!

64
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,764
This is so fun!

65
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,474
You're so embarrassing.

66
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,101
-I'm leaving!
-I'm staying!

67
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,644
My goodness.

68
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:30,895
I must have been insane.

69
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,855
Did I dance in front of a police car?

70
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,900
When was that?

71
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,443
On your birthday last year.

72
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,572
So this shows me what happened a year ago.

73
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,617
Kneading shows me more footage.

74
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,545
Does that show you different things?

75
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,297
Not really.

76
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,926
But I can see further into the past
the more I touch and knead the butt.

77
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,015
Come in.

78
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,020
How are you feeling?

79
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,897
How do you think I'm feeling
after being abducted?

80
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,609
I came here to explain
how the case will proceed going forward.

81
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,904
The suspect is being investigated
at Mujin Police Station.

82
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,866
And this case will be handled
by the Violent Crimes Unit.

83
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,494
If you have any questions about the case,
you can ask me.

84
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,871
Once you're discharged,

85
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,540
we need you at the station
for your statement.

86
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,126
Make sure

87
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,296
that bastard is never free again.

88
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,174
All right. Rest up then.

89
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,344
Hurry up and start streaming.

90
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,930
Do we really have to do this?

91
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,308
This is a heaven-sent opportunity.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,560
If I squeeze out a tear or two here,

93
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,312
I'll get a ton of donations.

94
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,108
Hi, everyone. It's me, Streamer Ms. Si-a.

95
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,821
You guys must have been worried
because I disappeared.

96
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,740
The truth is…

97
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,825
SHE'S FINALLY BACK
WHAT'S WITH THE HOSPITAL GOWN?

98
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,410
…I had been abducted.

99
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,578
THANK YOU FOR THE DONATION, ONLYSIA

100
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,996
THANK YOU FOR THE DONATION, NA3820

101
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,553
Captain?

102
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,099
What happened?

103
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,892
You see, John Wick…

104
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,352
I mean…

105
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,770
Ted Chang, that bastard…

106
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,647
Come on, speak clearly.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,691
Remember how we went to
Mujin Port to catch Ted Chang?

108
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,542
It looks like Ted Chang is making a deal.

109
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,626
Should we raid them?

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,378
Listen up.

111
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,632
You two stay here until backup arrives.

112
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,716
What about you?

113
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,389
Where are you going?

114
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,565
Captain,

115
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,444
don't tell me you're thinking about
that scene from John Wick.

116
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,530
I used to be
in Korea's top special forces.

117
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,283
Taking on ten men with this
is child's play.

118
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:31,784
Wait over there.

119
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,667
Stay where you are.

120
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,294
Or you'll just get hurt more.

121
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,967
That was a suicide attempt.

122
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,096
Captain, are you okay?

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,598
What happened?

124
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,267
You said it was child's play.

125
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,270
The pencil broke.

126
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,198
So you couldn't catch Ted Chang?

127
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,408
We did,

128
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,076
with the help of the special task force.

129
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,126
Okay, smile.

130
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,687
Raise your fists, please.

131
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,441
MUJIN POLICE ARREST DRUG LORD TED CHANG

132
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,403
Damn it.

133
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,447
I should have been there.

134
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,074
Detective Moon.

135
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,117
Hello, sir!

136
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,702
Lieutenant Moon Jang-yeol,

137
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,163
an honor graduate from the police academy,
formerly with the RIU

138
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,873
and now at the Mujin Violent Crimes Unit.

139
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,667
What an honor to see you again.

140
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,044
I heard you solved the abduction case.

141
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,381
Please keep up the good work for Mujin.

143
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,341
I'll be sure to remember
your hard work if I win.

144
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,259
Thank you, sir!

145
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,345
Oh, hello.

146
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,055
Hello, Assemblyman Cha.

147
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,723
My goodness, Captain Won.

148
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,642
Look at you.

149
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,143
I'm fine.

150
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,522
I heard you arrested
a notorious drug lord.

151
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,606
I did.

152
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,525
You sure are the pride of our city.

153
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,318
Just to make it clear,

154
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,488
we three here were the ones
who made our city proud.

155
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,156
Not him.

156
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,867
All he did was get himself beat up.

157
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,871
-I heard you'll be promoted.
-That's right.

158
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,250
All three of us here will get a promotion.

159
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,085
Not him.

160
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,422
He's been sitting on the sidelines.

161
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,383
Still, he caught the kidnapper.

162
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,429
Who cares? The Ted Chang case
is getting all the spotlight.

163
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,265
If he had just followed us,
he'd already be back in Seoul.

164
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,517
This is all because of that perv.

165
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,895
-Thank you so much for your hard work.
-I was just doing my job.

166
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,522
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

167
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,275
Let's go!

168
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,318
-Let's go.
-All right.

169
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,653
Hey, what are you doing?

170
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,365
Come here. It's okay.

171
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,201
Well then.

172
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,914
All right, take a picture of us
with this phone.

173
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,874
Sorry?

174
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,417
You have nothing to do anyway.

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,002
So take some pictures for us.

176
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,338
-Sure.
-Here.

177
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,632
Mr. Kang, you come here too.

178
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,508
-We should all be in the picture.
-Okay.

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,469
All right.

180
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,678
Make sure we look nice.

181
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,763
Here we go.

182
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,849
One, two, three.

183
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,518
Take one in landscape mode too.

184
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,188
One, two, three.

185
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,858
Thanks. Give it here.

186
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,776
All right.

187
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,114
Very nice.

188
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,491
He took very nice selfies.

189
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,450
Do I have a boyfriend?

190
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,743
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE PEOPLE?
YOU'RE SO PRETTY

191
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,286
I've never been in a relationship.

192
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,247
My father was so strict
that I couldn't even think of dating.

193
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,460
I'm going to keep thinking of
my subscribers as my boyfriend.

194
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,295
Guys, wait a second.

195
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,798
The officers
who recently solved a big case

196
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,591
are in the same hospital as me.

197
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,343
Hello!

198
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,761
Hi!

199
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,680
Please say hello to my subscribers.

200
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,765
-What the…
-Hello.

201
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,974
Don't film me.

202
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,934
Gosh.

203
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,851
She must be shy.

204
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,978
-Hello.
-Hi. But what's this?

205
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
I'm Streamer Ms. Si-a.

206
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,023
I see.

207
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,401
Hello.

208
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,860
-Who is that?
-Thank you so much

209
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,570
-She's the abduction victim.
-for protecting us!

210
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,739
She's apparently a famous online streamer.

211
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,324
How many subscribers does she have?

212
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,867
Put on a smile.

213
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,202
Hi.

214
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,204
-She has over 500,000.
-500,000?

215
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,997
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

216
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,416
Hello.

217
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,002
Hello, it's nice to meet you!

218
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,880
Hello, I'm Cha Ju-man,
candidate number one

219
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,340
in the upcoming general election.

220
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,884
It's important to exercise
your voting rights.

221
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,386
So be sure to vote.

222
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,056
And please consider voting for me.

223
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,391
Yes, thank you.

224
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:06,809
Let's shake hands.

225
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,519
Thank you so much.

226
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,812
So nice to meet you.

227
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,897
Look, people are posting comments.

228
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,526
They're saying
that you look like such a nice person.

229
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,861
Hello, and thank you.

230
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,614
Hey, why didn't you just play along?

231
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,366
She's so fake.

232
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,868
She doesn't actually care about us.

233
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,744
She just wants to thank us.

234
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,288
She's doing it for the money.

235
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,373
She wouldn't have even looked at us
if not for the donations.

236
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,252
Why do you sound like you know her well?

237
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,713
My husband was into her.

238
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,798
I'm getting annoyed again.

239
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,177
Good mor--

240
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,180
-What are you doing?
-Hey, perv.

241
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,848
-What are you going to do?
-About what?

242
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,018
I now have a huge gaping hole
in my career because of you.

243
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,146
Why? You caught the kidnapper
thanks to me.

244
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,440
Catching Ted Chang
would've sent me back to Seoul.

245
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,650
But I blew the chance
while trying to save you.

246
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,610
So?

247
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,821
Since I saved you,
shouldn't you save me in return?

248
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,573
How would I do that?

249
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,952
What's all this?

250
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,163
These are the cases you'll be solving.

251
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,707
How am I supposed to solve any of these?

252
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,209
You see everything
when you touch someone's butt.

253
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,502
Then you could see the culprits.

254
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,421
-What?
-You have to send me back to Seoul.

255
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,758
Look, I do want to help you.

256
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,259
But there's an issue

257
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,720
that I didn't tell you about.

258
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,430
What is it?

259
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,140
Whenever I use my power,

260
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
my hair falls out.

261
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,651
I guess hair loss is a serious problem.

262
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,027
Right?

263
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,284
What's this for?

264
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,621
If you have no hair in the first place,
you don't have to worry about losing it.

265
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,414
Make your choice.

266
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,919
Do you want to shave it all off
or lose some along the way?

267
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,683
I'll lose some along the way.

268
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,274
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,657
There are these thieves
that steal produce from farms.

270
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,617
And lately,

271
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,788
they've been stealing
any and all peppers from around here.

272
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,373
The prime suspects frequent this gym.

273
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,750
It's those guys.

274
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,257
Go touch them.

275
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,675
How?

276
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,760
Figure that out yourself.

277
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,612
It's them.

278
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,946
All right.

279
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,533
Are we done for the day?

280
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,453
What do you mean? We've only just begun.

281
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,663
I ache all over. I can't do this anymore.

282
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,669
THE HEALING SOO MASSAGE SPA

283
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,132
Detective Moon,

284
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,092
this is so thoughtful of you.

285
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,604
But this doesn't seem like
what the guests wear.

286
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,105
We're here for a man

287
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,858
who illegally occupied
some karaoke bars nine months ago.

288
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,234
What?

289
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,699
What took you so long?

290
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,410
Sorry.

291
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,579
I'll get started then.

292
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,843
Start already.

293
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,680
One moment, please.

294
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,895
-What is it?
-There's a red monster on his back.

295
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,731
It has horns,
and its bulging eyes are glaring at me.

296
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,483
-Wait!
-Go!

297
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,698
-What are you doing?
-Sorry?

298
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,032
Hurry up and get started.

299
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,450
Okay.

300
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,827
Well then…

301
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,123
All right.

302
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,668
I'll get started.

303
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,550
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,024
Detective Moon!

305
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,936
Come here, you.

306
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,816
Was this guy at the karaoke bar or not?

307
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,694
That was my boys. I wasn't there.

308
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,821
He was there singing this song.

309
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,823
The sunlight…

310
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,952
The sunlight that pours over me

311
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:05,542
I hope my dazzling dreams bloom too

312
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,629
-Putting things off over and over
-Over and over

313
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,548
-Those exhausting days
-Those exhausting--

314
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:17,763
I hope today is happier

315
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,058
Than yesterday

316
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,815
What's wrong?

317
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,734
I think I pushed myself too hard
and got injured.

318
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,194
My hands are pretty fragile.

319
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,155
They're so delicate.

320
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,659
I'm sorry I can't help you anymore.

321
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,294
What is this?

322
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,922
This is called Iron Palm Training.

323
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,759
It's how the monks at the Shaolin Temple
trained their hands.

324
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,804
You'll be able to shove your hand
through a brick wall after this.

325
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,056
That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

326
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,642
Say "delicate" at one, and "hands" at two.

327
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,977
Let's go.

328
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,019
One.

329
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,359
Could you demonstrate it for me?

330
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,527
I'll follow after you.

331
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,030
You're so high-maintenance.

332
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,574
Delicate! Hands!

333
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,284
Okay?

334
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,201
Now, one.

335
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,123
Delicate!

336
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,666
What? Two.

337
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,544
-Hands!
-No. Faster, deeper!

338
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,837
One, delicate! Two, hands!

339
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,921
-One!
-Delicate!

340
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,922
-Two!
-Hands!

341
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,841
-One! Two!
-Delicate! Hands!

342
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,134
Now, both hands! One!

343
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,635
-Delicate! Hands!
-Two!

344
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,679
-One! Two!
-Delicate! Hands!

345
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,855
FINGERPRINT DOES NOT MATCH

346
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,774
See? He worked me so hard
that my fingerprints disappeared.

347
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,985
Is he a nutjob or what?

348
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,404
My hands are all scraped.

349
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,324
I should put some Band-Aids on them.

350
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,367
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

351
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,328
I don't think they sell Band-Aids.

352
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,079
Oh, my.

353
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,081
Then I have to go to
the convenience store.

354
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,635
What are you doing here?

355
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,804
I'm going to film a vlog.

356
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,732
My subscribers
are always curious about this.

357
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,569
They want to know
if shamans also buy lottery tickets.

358
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,112
I just bought one.

359
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,700
Shamans can win the lottery
through the power of their deity.

360
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,287
But that would be divulging
a heavenly secret,

361
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,625
which can result in much more bad luck
than the initial stroke of good luck.

362
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,045
But I will show you just this once.

363
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,967
Since I'm not summoning
the power of my deity,

364
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,303
there's no way I'll win.

365
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,100
Let's see here.

366
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,519
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WON

367
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,983
The 1st row says 500 million won.

368
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,531
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION WON

369
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,503
I'm not shocked at all by this.

370
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,430
FIVE

371
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,153
FIVE HUNDRED WON

372
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,504
Better luck next time.

373
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,636
Excuse me.

374
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,264
Dr. Bong.

375
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,433
Hi, Seon-woo.

376
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,853
Are you hurt?

377
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,939
I hurt my hands a little.

378
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,858
Let me take a look.

379
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,529
It looks pretty bad.

380
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,666
I get scratched by the cats all the time,
so I always carry this around.

381
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,045
All done.

382
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,379
Just put on some Band-Aids.

383
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,006
Thank you.

384
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,759
We have so much expired food.
Feel free to take some home.

385
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,098
I can't finish these by myself.

386
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,269
Have you had dinner yet?

387
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,315
No.

388
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,875
This is such a feast.

389
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,670
They're slightly past their sell-by date,

390
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,798
but they're still edible.

391
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,219
And they cost more
than what I make in an hour.

392
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,929
Thank you.

393
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,063
It's good.

394
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,277
I'll treat you to a better meal next time.

395
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,781
It's not about what you eat
but who you eat it with.

396
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,616
Sorry?

397
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,827
It's what my mom used to say.

398
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,830
You won't be able to enjoy
even the best food in the world

399
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,956
with someone you hate.

400
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,086
But if you're with someone you like,
everything you eat will feel like a feast.

401
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,300
You have a good mother.

402
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,760
I did.

403
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,762
She passed away though.

404
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,184
I'm fine.

405
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,020
It's been so long
that I don't feel sad anymore.

406
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,734
Same here.

407
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:47,903
Sorry?

408
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,822
My mom passed away too.

409
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,160
To be honest,

410
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,537
this is her hometown.

411
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,958
I remember her telling me
it was a nice place to live

412
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,337
because the air and people were good here.

413
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,963
That's why I moved here.

414
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,217
I see.

415
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,385
I wanted to see for myself,

416
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,555
and my mom was right.

417
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,354
The air is good here.

418
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,985
And the people are too.

419
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,371
We have quite a lot in common.

420
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,580
We both like cats too.

421
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,459
If it's okay with you,

422
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:48,546
can we be friends?

423
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,009
But…

424
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,222
your girlfriend won't like it.

425
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,476
I don't have a girlfriend.

426
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,355
So you don't.

427
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,860
But there is someone

428
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,322
I'm interested in these days.

429
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,331
Really?

430
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,965
I could be the one he's interested in.

431
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,050
We saved a cat together,

432
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,678
and he even treated my wound.

433
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,596
And on top of that,

434
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,141
he moved close to where I live.

435
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,600
It must be me.

436
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,854
Should I just check real quick?

437
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,607
You wanted to return to Seoul
but bailed out of the Ted Chang case.

438
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,860
So how are you going to
come back any time soon?

439
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,528
Don't get me started.

440
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,072
Is there any news on Seung-gil?

441
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,073
No.

442
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,158
Okay.

443
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,744
Give me a call if you hear anything.

444
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,881
Will you look at her?

445
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,765
Jeez, that little perv.

446
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,355
She's trying so hard.

447
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,901
We're here.

448
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,487
Good night then.

449
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,996
-Seon-woo.
-Yes?

450
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,415
You have gum stuck to your butt.

451
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,541
I'll get it off.

452
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,001
Excuse me.

453
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,846
I got it off.

454
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,348
Thank you.

455
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,935
Bye then.

456
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,395
Bye.

457
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,443
What was that?
Why couldn't I see anything?

458
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,071
Did I touch him too lightly?

459
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,327
BONG’S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

460
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,835
Auntie,

461
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,795
what's with the long face?

462
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,171
Do we not have enough money?

463
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:36,923
It's just that

464
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,509
we've been living hand to mouth,

465
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,970
but you haven't seen
any patients in a while.

466
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,430
We're in a pretty bad state.

467
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,639
Don't worry.

468
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,725
I'll treat patients again.

469
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,351
-Start setting up appointments.
-Really?

470
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,020
Yes. So don't worry
and get ready to open the hospital.

471
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,814
You can start first.

472
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,567
I'm taking your grandpa to the hospital.

473
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,444
Is he unwell?

474
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:01,239
His back doesn't seem to be fully healed.

475
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,824
He says he's fine,

476
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,909
but he seems to have trouble walking.

477
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,911
I want to see what his condition is.

478
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,208
Father, the cab is here! Come out!

479
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,091
See you later.

480
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,477
MUJIN MEDICAL CENTER

481
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,482
You didn't have to come with me.

482
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,900
I could have come alone.

483
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,987
Why do you insist on coming alone
when your back is injured?

484
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,758
Father, press the button
for the fourth floor.

485
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,764
What the…

486
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,849
Why would you do that?

487
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,309
I'm sorry.

488
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,438
I'm sorry. It must have been an accident.

489
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,985
Who cares if it was an accident?
It's so annoying.

490
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,403
Excuse me.

491
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,572
What did you just say?

492
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,325
How could you say that to an elder?

493
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,578
Who do you think is at fault here?

494
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,413
Screw you.

495
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,542
Hey! What did you just say?

496
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,545
You're way out of line here! Apologize.

497
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,672
Why should I apologize?

498
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,632
You should be apologizing to me.

499
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,009
Why you little…

500
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:45,969
Let go!

501
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,804
Why should I? Apologize right now.

502
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,055
Enough.

503
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,015
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,476
It was a mistake.

505
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,019
Go to hell.

506
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,020
Oh, my gosh.

507
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,692
What on earth is her problem?

508
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,863
Don't worry about it.

509
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:09,117
There's nothing to be done
about rude brats like her.

510
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,164
I'll go inside by myself.

511
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,916
Why? We should go together.

512
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
What am I, a little kid?

513
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,253
Just wait outside.

514
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,306
I heard you arrested a drug lord in Mujin.

515
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,434
You sure are the pride of our city.
I heard you'll be promoted.

516
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,852
That's right.

517
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,324
Jong-muk.

518
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,950
What's wrong?

519
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,785
What happened to you?

520
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,495
What are you doing here?

521
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,914
That's not important right now.

522
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,415
Jong-muk,

523
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,460
what terrible thing happened to you?

524
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:04,005
No, something very fortunate
happened to me.

525
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,340
You're lying.

526
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,257
You look…

527
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,885
absolutely miserable.

528
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:13,056
No, this is one of
the happiest periods of my life.

529
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,015
No.

530
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,850
You're…

531
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,685
miserable.

532
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,813
Please just leave me alone.

533
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm happy right now.

534
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,024
Come to me.

535
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,285
I said I'm happy!
Why are you doing this to me?

536
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,497
You've always been like this.

537
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,457
You keep putting me in danger

538
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,918
while pretending to care about me.

539
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,339
Why are we here?

540
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,426
To do something that will make us
super excited and happy!

541
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,557
Just watch.

542
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,851
This will make you really happy.

543
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,737
What do you think?
Don't you feel so happy?

544
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,995
But just one doesn't make me happy enough.

545
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,663
-Jong-muk.
-Yes?

546
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,916
We'll be so much happier
if you turn on all of them.

547
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,418
-Should I?
-Yes.

548
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,649
What do you think you're doing?

549
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,244
One!

550
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,246
We shouldn't…

551
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,372
Louder. Two!

552
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,916
…waste water!

553
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,959
One!

554
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,088
We shouldn't…

555
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,506
Two!

556
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,425
…waste water!

557
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:16,304
I was disciplined all night long.

558
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,266
And my father beat me to a pulp

559
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,769
when he had to pay 23,000 won
for the water bill.

560
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,230
And look what you've done to me now. I'm

561
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,648
sorry.

562
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,109
What can I do for you?

563
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,321
What can I do to make you feel better?

564
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,491
You can go in right through there.

565
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,867
Go on in.

566
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,288
I ended up hurting him again

567
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,915
when I should be nice to him.

568
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,674
But I will

569
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,468
still keep on trudging along

570
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,388
step by step.

571
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,601
You're so cute.

572
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,353
So what can I help you with?

573
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,063
Everything else is fine,

574
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:11,275
but it's obsessed with the clothes
and socks I take off after work.

575
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,236
Let me take a look.

576
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,669
Doctor, why is my dog acting this way?

577
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,463
Well…

578
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,675
It could be because it's teething.

579
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,428
Let me take another look.

580
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,862
What?

581
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,946
What are you doing?

582
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,906
Why can't I see anything?

583
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,283
Why are you touching my butt?

584
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,751
Why doesn't it work?

585
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,671
Did I really lose my power?

586
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,056
All my fingerprints are gone.

587
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,475
-One!
-Delicate!

588
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
-Two!
-Hands!

589
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,853
-Now, both hands!
-Delicate!

590
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,107
FINGERPRINT DOES NOT MATCH

591
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,654
Did my power disappear
with my fingerprints?

592
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,948
That son of a…

593
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,703
A BETTER MUJIN! CENTER OF TOURISM!
NO.1 CHA JU-MAN

594
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,319
What's your take on this?

595
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,240
You rarely see a case this big
here in Mujin.

596
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,286
Are you smiling right now?

597
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,872
This is my default expression.

598
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,209
Where's Captain Won?

599
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,294
He's still hospitalized.

600
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,130
You can tell me what happened, sir.

601
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,925
What exactly was stolen?

602
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,762
Your donor list?

603
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,180
Yes.

604
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,891
It's a document that lists the names

605
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,435
of all my donors
and how much they've donated.

606
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
Sir.

607
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,148
One can donate
up to five million won a year,

608
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,777
but one of my donors
donated under his wife's name too.

609
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,239
We were going to return
the extra donation,

610
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,449
but then the list disappeared.

611
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,243
Oh, no.

612
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,246
If the list gets into the hands
of an opposing candidate,

613
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,956
it could be misused.

614
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,001
And it could influence the election.

615
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:19,255
The things we're discussing here
can never be made public.

616
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,798
We ask for your discretion.

617
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,842
Yes, I understand.

618
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,305
But I suspect that the document
was stolen by someone on the inside

619
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,806
who understands its value.

620
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,101
Is there anyone you might suspect?

621
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,231
The people here have been with me
for over ten years

622
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,858
and are like family to me.

623
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,611
No one here would do that.

624
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,032
Everyone is capable of betrayal.

625
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,700
Excuse me?

626
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,495
You shouldn't trust anyone
until the truth comes out.

627
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,998
Except for the detective
handling your case.

628
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,792
-Then…
-That's right!

629
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,046
You should only be trusting me.

630
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,385
You can go out first.

631
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,054
Just a second, please.

632
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,228
Do you have something else to say?

633
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:21,359
I would like to ask you for a favor.

634
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,325
Where should we begin?

635
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,078
You're going to return to the station
with Detective Bae.

636
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,120
And?

637
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,747
And just stay put.

638
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,165
Sorry?

639
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,096
This is my ticket back to Seoul!

640
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,225
I can't see anything anymore.

641
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,142
What?

642
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,977
What do you mean you can't see anything?

643
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,397
I lost my powers after you overworked me.

644
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,399
-For real?
-For real.

645
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,485
-Let me…
-Don't touch me.

646
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,404
Why now of all times?

647
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,156
Then you shouldn't have overworked
my precious hands.

648
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm actually a very sensitive person.

649
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,203
I'm picky with food, have sensitive skin,
and am meticulous all around.

650
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,080
-So?
-Even in school,

651
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:18,707
some kids are motivated by criticism

652
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,877
while other kids are motivated
by compliments, and I'm the latter.

653
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,130
The carrot works better on me
than the stick.

654
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,798
But what did you do to me?

655
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,259
You constantly threatened and scolded me.

656
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,218
So?

657
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:32,471
Are you saying
you can't use your abilities anymore?

658
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,975
How would I know?
Maybe if my hands go back to normal.

659
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,522
"Hand."

660
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,119
-I'll take all of these.
-Okay.

661
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,537
Do you have any more hand products?

662
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,705
Hand products?

663
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,374
Yes, it's for someone
with extremely delicate hands.

664
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,584
What do you recommend?

665
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,336
Then how about this?

666
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,297
-It's made from French--
-Great.

667
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,007
-This is an all-natural--
-Sure.

668
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,966
Give me everything.

669
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,594
Sir!

670
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,763
I'll throw in a lip balm for free.

671
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,182
Okay, thank you.

672
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,266
Thank you.

673
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,104
Welcome.

674
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,190
LONG CUFF CLEAN DISPOSABLE GLOVES

675
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,442
That'll be 2,000 won.

676
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,612
COLOR LIP BALM

677
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,825
Your lips are chapped.

678
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,577
Use this.

679
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,247
Oh, shoot.

680
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,697
She's head over heels for someone again.

681
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,463
That feels good.

682
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,063
-What?
-Are you going to only massage my hands?

683
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,023
Massage my shoulders too.

684
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,115
So do you think your power is coming back?

685
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,617
You should've been this nice to me
in the first place.

686
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,703
Why do things you'll regret?

687
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,666
Right here.

688
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,294
What do you think? Is this working?

689
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,170
I'm not sure.

690
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,631
I'll kill you.

691
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,925
Then who should I touch?

692
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,388
What are you two up to?

693
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,599
An incompetent detective
is taking advantage of a psychic.

694
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,850
Hey!

695
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,312
She knows about my power too.

696
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,481
That's great.

697
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,276
You could test it out on her.

698
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,235
What?

699
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,653
Test what out?

700
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,947
My power wouldn't have disappeared
in the first place

701
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,866
if they were to return so easily.

702
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,284
Do it.

703
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,595
Your lips are chapped. Use this.

704
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,183
Oh, shoot.

705
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,276
So? Can you see something now?

706
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,986
No.

707
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,071
You're lying.

708
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,489
-You saw something.
-I didn't.

709
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,616
Hey, how do you know if she's lying?

710
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,618
She avoids eye contact when she's lying.

711
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,798
Hey, why did you tell him that?

712
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,800
I couldn't lie to a cop, could I?

713
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,427
You like that nutjob, don't you?

714
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,138
-Me?
-You played the accordion earlier.

715
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,933
I was just bored.

716
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,351
Bored?

717
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,561
Then why did your heart race
when you saw him?

718
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,439
-You can hear my heartbeat too?
-Yes.

719
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,441
It's because I had a lot of coffee.

720
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,568
You've got to be kidding me.

721
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,780
You know how your heart doesn't race
when you get paid since it's yours anyway?

722
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,116
Your heart only races
when you know something isn't yours

723
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,742
but it could become yours

724
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,619
if you play your cards right.

725
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,246
Pull yourself together, you're--

726
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:09,581
Ye-bun.

727
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,917
No matter what you heard,

728
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,627
what I say is fact.

729
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,506
Ok-hui.

730
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:21,343
Too much caffeine
can interfere with your sleep,

731
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,138
make you nervous, nauseous, or anxious.

732
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,472
So be careful.

733
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,021
MUJIN POLICE STATION

734
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,527
Why are you two just sitting here?

735
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,572
Someone broke into
Assemblyman Cha's election office.

736
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:45,242
Detective Moon told us to just stay put.

737
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,494
That's ridiculous.

738
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,329
Why just sit here
when you should be investigating?

739
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,497
What are you, ducks?

740
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,082
Where's the one who told you to stay put?

741
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,334
At the scene, I guess.

742
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,295
You're all driving me crazy.

743
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:01,091
The one who should stay put is him!
What is going on here?

744
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,886
Then should we head out?

745
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:04,887
You bet!

746
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,556
Check all the security cameras
and dash cams.

747
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,309
Then investigate the alibis
of everyone at the office.

748
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,311
-Yes, sir.
-We were just following orders.

749
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,938
What are you mumbling about now?

750
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,566
A BETTER MUJIN! CENTER OF TOURISM!
NO.1 CHA JU-MAN

751
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,443
Did you check the security cameras?

752
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,362
No one came in through the front entrance.

753
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,072
So they used the back entrance?

754
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,659
Should we check the dash cams
in the cars that are parked out back?

755
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,833
-What do we do now?
-We need to check the dash cams.

756
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,585
From the cars?

757
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,795
Unfortunately, this is a blind spot.

758
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,634
We have a better option.

759
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,386
A human dash cam.

760
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,017
Excuse me, sir.

761
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,479
Have you been parked, I mean…

762
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,147
Have you been staying here for long?

763
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,027
Have you been staying here for long?

764
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,864
Sir, please answer my question.

765
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,785
Sir,

766
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,037
have you eaten?

767
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,421
Here.

768
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,967
Take your time
and eat as much as you want.

769
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,019
Thank you for the meal.

770
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,402
Excuse me,
you have something on your butt.

771
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,653
I'll get it off.

772
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,697
Right here.

773
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,543
He saw the thief.

774
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,423
May I go now?

775
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,550
Hold on.

776
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,303
Call me at this number anytime,

777
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,096
and I'll treat you to a meal.

778
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,769
Bye.

779
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,231
Did you see something?

780
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,695
He saw the culprit,
but he fell asleep at the crucial moment.

781
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,363
You can't see anything if they're asleep?

782
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,740
I can't see anything

783
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,450
as long as their eyes are closed.

784
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:32,951
In other words,

785
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,621
I think I can only see
what enters their optic nerve.

786
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,248
What kind of superpower is that fussy?

787
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,917
So how are things proceeding?

788
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
Nothing was caught
on the security cameras.

789
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,505
Nothing to note on the dash cams either.

790
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,801
If nothing was caught
on the security cameras or dash cams,

791
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,637
are you saying they left no trace?

792
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,971
There is a trace.

793
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,686
I mean, there must be a trace.

794
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,983
The culprit might be on the inside,

795
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,652
so we should investigate everyone.

796
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,030
But shouldn't we investigate
the opposing party first?

797
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,033
The one who would gain the most
from obtaining that document

798
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,451
is the opposing candidate.

799
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,204
You have a point.

800
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,207
But how do we investigate
all those people?

801
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,918
Should we call them in all at once?

802
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,424
-Your number one, Cha Ju-man!
-Your number one, Cha Ju-man!

803
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,844
Candidate number two
will put the citizens first!

804
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,680
-Go touch everyone.
-Park Tae-seok!

805
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,932
-You mean, everyone here?
-Yes.

806
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,975
This is the only way
I can return to Seoul.

807
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,853
How can I touch all of them?

808
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,523
What if I end up
being labeled as a pervert

809
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,274
and no one wants to marry me?

810
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,193
-You're already…
-Already what?

811
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,822
Seriously.

812
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,699
I'm grateful that you saved me,

813
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,701
but that was your duty
as a police officer.

814
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,661
I think I've done enough,

815
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,955
so I'll leave you on your own now.

816
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,081
Dr. Bong.

817
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,084
Take a look at this before you go.

818
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,386
No matter how much you like him,
you shouldn't abuse your power like this.

819
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:20,142
I'd like to phone a friend.

820
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,062
Hi, Bunnie, what's up?

821
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,148
Got it.

822
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,236
Thanks for showing up today too.

823
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,195
-Yes, sis!
-Yes, sis!

824
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,947
Eun-hye, what's your specialty?

825
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,032
Grabbing people by the hair.

826
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,410
You little…

827
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,121
So you twirl the hair. You're in.

828
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,291
-Yeong-hui, what's your specialty?
-It's cursing.

829
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,754
You useless motherf*****.
You're such an annoying little b****.

830
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,214
I'm going to hit you
with a full swing from the bottom up

831
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,716
so that your neck snaps
and does a 360, you piece of s***.

832
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,633
I'll chew you up starting from--

833
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,429
UNSUITABLE FOR BROADCASTING

834
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,390
You're out. That can't go on air.

835
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,600
Sorry, sis.

836
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,601
Mi-yeong, what's your specialty?

837
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,982
Water punches. You're in.

838
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,525
I sell accessories.

839
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,236
That's your specialty?

840
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,947
The rings would leave marks on the face.
Good. You're in.

841
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,282
Hwa-in, what about you?

842
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,325
I like martial arts, sis.

843
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,329
You're in.

844
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,830
Jeong-hyeon, what's your specialty?

845
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,457
I'm good at open-hand strikes.

846
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,252
You're in.

847
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,379
Okay, girls. Call in enough people…

848
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,092
Gosh, why are you here again?
What's your specialty?

849
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,929
I know all the latest swear words, sis.

850
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,514
Like I said, you shouldn't go too far.

851
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,849
I'm good at cursing like a 12-year-old.

852
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,310
I'm a teacher,
so I know how kids these days curse.

853
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,394
You're a teacher?

854
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,563
Yes, sis. Would you like to see?

855
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,523
Sure.

856
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,486
-You're saying them to me?
-Yes.

857
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,073
You're cringe and you got no drip.
You're mad jelly and you're salty.

858
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,116
You're a simp, you fail every vibe check
'cause your vibe is sus.

859
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,327
Your face looks like what my dog vomits
after eating my homework.

860
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,454
You got no friends 'cause you get ratioed.

861
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,623
All your jokes are so millennial,
so go touch--

862
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,125
Gosh, I'm sorry.

863
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,670
I couldn't help it
because I was getting pissed off.

864
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,006
It's okay. It happens a lot, sis.

865
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,967
All right.

866
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:21,096
Assemblyman Cha
has made a very good point.

867
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,100
It's true that he has been in office
for the last four years…

868
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,018
What's going on with that phone call?

869
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,103
What?

870
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,272
There they are.

871
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,531
And over there too.

872
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:54,629
I will bring in a university hospital
no matter what

873
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,507
so that we can attract
young talent here to Mujin…

874
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,262
You're cringe and you got no drip.
You're mad jelly and you're salty.

875
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,223
You're a simp, you fail every vibe check
'cause your vibe is sus.

876
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,058
Your face looks like what my dog vomits
after eating my homework.

877
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,810
You got no friends 'cause you get ratioed.

878
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,396
All your jokes are so millennial,
so go touch some grass!

879
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,689
Why, you little…

880
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,235
How dare you!

881
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,654
Number two hit number one!

882
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,947
-Number two hit number one!
-Number two hit number one!

883
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,657
-Number one hit number two!
-Number one hit number two!

884
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,218
Assemblyman Cha's aide was at the office
on the day it happened.

885
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,261
Why didn't he say that he was there?

886
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,931
He probably has a reason why he didn't.

887
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,768
You see the woman
with brown hair over there?

888
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,190
Go touch her.

889
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:38,817
Okay.

890
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,161
Ok-hui!

891
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,479
So? Did you see anything?

892
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,441
No.

893
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,443
I didn't see anything.

894
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,070
You really didn't see anything?

895
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,744
I really didn't.

896
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,306
Babe, you're…

897
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,035
Turn the car around.

898
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,703
Why?

899
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,039
I'm craving beer
now that I'm out of the hospital.

900
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,508
It's you, isn't it?

901
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,511
Ms. Si-a.

902
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,179
Yes, that's me.

903
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,764
Hello.

904
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,600
It's nice to meet you.

905
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,352
I'm a fan.

906
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,355
I'm also on MeTube.

907
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,232
Is that right?

908
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,609
My channel is called General MacArthur TV.

909
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,195
I'm a shaman MeTuber.

910
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,157
Come on my channel,
and I'll read your fortune.

911
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,909
Okay, I can't wait.

912
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,369
Great.

913
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,718
That'll be 10,000 won.

914
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,646
You're really cute.

915
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,608
I bet you'd look great on camera too.

916
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:10,820
Thank you.

917
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,786
Give me a call.

918
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,997
I'll buy you a drink.

919
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,648
You can go.

920
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,982
Why all of a sudden?

921
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,069
Come on. Take a hint, will you?

922
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,989
Sorry.

923
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,789
Edit the videos properly.
Don't get distracted.

924
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,378
First, the energy of water and trees.

925
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,880
And I'm not talking about
just any old water or trees…

926
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,177
I'm headed to your place right now.

927
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,931
But seriously, do you have to do this?

928
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,267
You think my fans will still send me money
if they know I have a boyfriend?

929
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,560
No, they won't!

930
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,604
If my top donor finds out
and asks for a refund,

931
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,398
will you take responsibility?

932
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,914
My goodness.

933
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,671
Oh, no. It's all smashed up.

934
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,342
Are you okay?

935
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,635
Are you hurt?

936
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,220
Does it look like I'm okay?

937
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,347
Oh, you're badly hurt.

938
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,016
Don't touch me!

939
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,477
-Jeez.
-I was just worried.

940
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,980
Stop bothering me and just go.

941
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,025
You don't need help?
Will you be all right on your own?

942
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,403
I'm going to call a tow truck
and the insurance company, so just go!

943
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,364
All right.

944
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:40,970
Hello?

945
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,889
I just got into an accident.

946
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,017
The address here?

947
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,272
How am I supposed to know that?

948
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,116
I hate this place.

949
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,785
When is the tow truck coming?

950
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,418
What the…

951
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,387
What the hell?

952
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,317
Please let me go.

953
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,030
Please let me go.

954
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,367
Please let me go.

955
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,577
Please let me go.

956
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,500
Please let me go.

957
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,502
Please.

958
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,259
Please let me go.

959
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,930
Please let me go.

960
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,175
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

961
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,926
What happens now?

962
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,553
We'll have to catch the culprit
no matter what.

963
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,930
I don't know what you're up to,
but please stop.

964
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,640
He's investigating
the live burial incident.

965
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:51,142
So just tell him what you saw.

966
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,896
I wish all the bad people in this world
would just disappear.

967
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,105
Did you really not see anything?

968
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,274
I'm telling you,
there's something off about this town.

969
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,109
We need to get this bastard.

970
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,111
Everything is up to my hands now.

971
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,946
So your power gets upgraded?

972
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,156
Exactly.

973
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,158
-It's time for the next step.
-Next step?

974
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,243
I'm going to get you, you punk.

975
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,662
It seems like they're working in cells.

976
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,830
Organized crime…

977
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,207
They're going to dump us in the water.

978
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,250
We'll both end up being fish food.
Let's get out of here.

979
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,251
Stay right here.

980
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,252
Is there a way?

981
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:25,718
