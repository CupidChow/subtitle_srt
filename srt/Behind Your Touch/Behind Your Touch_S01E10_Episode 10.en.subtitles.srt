1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,591
Is that a cat tower?

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,469
Yes, I'm making one.

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,971
It's so pretty.

5
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,936
So sturdy, too.

6
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,030
They can go through there and…

7
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,657
BONG YE-BUN

8
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,536
You use a chef's knife
instead of a paring knife to cut fruit?

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,704
Yes, this one's nice and sharp.

10
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,250
It catches my eye the most too.

11
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,174
Thank you, Seon-woo.

12
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,056
But Detective,
what brings you here at this hour?

13
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,560
How did you even know about this place?

14
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,022
I was in the area,
and I had something to ask you about.

15
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,652
What is it?

16
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,073
What were you doing on the election day?
I heard you took the day off.

17
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,246
Do you think

18
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,874
I'm the killer?

19
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,503
It's not that I think you are.

20
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,630
Let's just say
there is reasonable suspicion.

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,634
Wasn't that the day

22
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,720
you had a drink with me?

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,559
I had a drink with Dr. Bong
in the afternoon,

24
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,147
and I came here afterward
to get the wood I ordered.

25
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,943
And I guess you have someone
who can back up your alibi?

26
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,907
Do you want the phone number
of my wood supplier?

27
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,877
Why would you suspect an innocent man?

28
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,672
It's a detective's job
to be suspicious of people.

29
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,382
Suspicion is always the first step.

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,217
Isn't it just that you don't like him?

31
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,095
The murders started happening
after he came to Mujin,

32
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,098
and crimes naturally follow the criminals.

33
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,435
That's why we always suspect
any outsiders first when a crime occurs.

34
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,438
Didn't you move here around that time too?

35
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,359
Yes, but I'm a police officer.

36
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,486
What, a police officer can't kill people?

37
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,404
Wait.

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,449
You know I'm psychic,

39
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,868
and you know the ins and outs
of this investigation.

40
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,578
-It can't be.
-Why, you…

41
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,041
Anyway, beware of Kim Seon-woo.

42
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,585
Something about him feels off.

43
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,928
FEMALE SERVERS WANTED

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,765
MUJIN COFFEE SHOP

45
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,648
You didn't have to come with me
to a flower shop.

46
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,525
I have to protect you.

47
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,610
I heard the killer almost got you too.

48
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,741
I've been so preoccupied with dating
that I had no idea you were in danger.

49
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,784
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,374
CARNATION
APPRECIATION, LOVE

51
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,669
MARIGOLD
HAPPINESS THAT IS BOUND TO COME

52
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,215
Excuse me, I'll take this flower.

53
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,018
They say that marigolds thrive
wherever you plant them.

54
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,315
I hope that Ji-suk will be happy
in her next life,

55
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,984
wherever she may be, like marigolds.

56
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,823
The coffee shop still seems to be open.

57
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,700
Yeah.

58
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,036
They even put up a job posting too.

59
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,538
That doesn't seem right.

60
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,373
One of their employees just died.

61
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,626
I know.

62
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,798
But how did the killer know
that Ji-suk was hiding here?

63
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,010
What? The killer is psychic?

64
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,680
Yes, he must have found her
by touching me.

65
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,184
So there's one more person
other than you and Gwang-sik?

66
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,560
Yes.

67
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,395
I just got chills.

68
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,066
Then…

69
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,777
If he touched you,
he must know everything about you.

70
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,862
Right.

71
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,363
You need to be careful.

72
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,408
He knows what you look like too.

73
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,452
And now that you've hit him on the head,

74
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,870
he wouldn't just sit back.

75
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,872
That's right.

76
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,875
But…

77
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,878
why hasn't he killed you yet?

78
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,301
Maybe he's playing with you.

79
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,304
Instead of letting you die easily,

80
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,681
he might keep tormenting you
until you want to die.

81
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,602
He'll start messing with
those around you first

82
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,231
in order to put you in more pain.

83
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,900
Those around me?

84
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
Yes.

85
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,446
Someone inseparable from you,

86
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,324
someone you care about,

87
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,368
and someone close to you.

88
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,328
That's his next target.

89
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,122
And that person…

90
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,793
is me.

91
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,921
I'm going to die.

92
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,883
Goodness, I'm going to die
because of Bong Ye-bun.

93
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,052
Come on,

94
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,846
let me eat some ramyeon before I die.

95
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,805
Ok-hui.

96
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,431
-Jeez.
-Ok-hui…

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,440
Tim Tin?

98
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,663
Who is this? I've never seen him before.

99
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,542
Who are you? Are you here alone?

100
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,128
He's obviously speaking English.

101
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,637
What is he saying?

102
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,556
He says his mom and dad had a fight.

103
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,559
Justin.

104
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,812
You should let me know
if you're going outside.

105
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,272
You don't even know your way around.

106
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,107
Mr. Park, who is this?

107
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,318
He's my son.

108
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,820
Your son?

109
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,156
Didn't you say he was in Australia?

110
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:14,035
To be honest, I had a fight
with my wife the last time I was there.

111
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,287
So I brought him back with me to Korea.

112
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,166
But this is the first time I've seen him.

113
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,211
Someone was looking after him for me.

114
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,506
You know my situation,
how I have to earn money and all.

115
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,383
But something came up,
and I had to bring him here.

116
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,261
It must be tough caring for him alone.

117
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,430
He has it worse.

118
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,266
He's in a strange place without his mom.

119
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,685
Justin.

120
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,989
The autopsy results came out,

121
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,283
and Ms. Lee Ji-suk sustained
a lot of stab wounds

122
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,409
like the other victims.

123
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,413
But it was the stab to the heart
that was fatal for her.

124
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,165
Right here.

125
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,418
The cause of death was excessive bleeding.

126
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,006
But according to Dr. Bong,

127
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,802
there were no signs
that the killer was following them.

128
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:17,848
How on earth did he know
that she was hiding there?

129
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,976
Detective Moon,

130
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,435
do you know anything?

131
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:23,271
I'm…

132
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,691
going to go have a meeting.

133
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,777
This is a meeting too.

134
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,991
Who on earth
is he having a meeting with about what?

135
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,370
People who sneak out like that
tend to end up cheating.

136
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,915
Is he investigating with someone else?

137
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,378
You should stop trying to connect
everything with cheating, okay?

138
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
Excuse me for a second.

139
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,473
Hello?

140
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,564
Yes, Detective?

141
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,649
Report to HQ, everyone.

142
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,192
-What? Now?
-Understood.

143
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,363
I'll take another look.

144
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,033
Move this over there for me, will you?

145
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,163
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

146
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,966
What took you so long?

147
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,886
Look, I have a job.

148
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,221
You can't be ordering me around like this.

149
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,640
We all have a job.

150
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,268
This man right here came first
even though he lives so far away.

151
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,688
You can call me over anytime you want.

152
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,025
What is this about anyway?

153
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,570
Okay, let me sum up
the information we have so far.

154
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,488
First.

155
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,367
The killer is psychic.

156
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,957
Aren't you learning anything from him?

157
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,423
Come on, I have experience
with investigations.

158
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,676
Second.

159
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,930
The killer knows

160
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,682
that Bong Ye-bun is psychic.

161
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,268
Now, third.

162
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,772
In order to conceal his crimes
from Bong Ye-bun,

163
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,025
the killer commits them
with his eyes closed.

164
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,196
We can't tell whether the blackouts
in between the memories

165
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,365
were created naturally or intentionally.

166
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,201
Therefore, the killer
could be among the people

167
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,744
that Bong has touched before.

168
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,499
So we have to put everyone we eliminated
as suspects back on the list.

169
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,296
There were some people I ran into
on the way to get Detective Moon

170
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,090
on the night of the crime.

171
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,967
They're our main suspects.

172
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,677
Fourth.

173
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,223
It is highly likely that the killer
found out about Gwang-sik being psychic

174
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:08,519
by seeing Bong Ye-bun's memories.

175
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,479
If he touched me, he definitely knows.

176
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,689
We don't know that for sure.

177
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,399
On that night,

178
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,943
you were touching Geumsil's butt,
and Gwang-sik was touching her leg.

179
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,236
But what about this guy?

180
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,363
He wasn't touching Geumsil anywhere.

181
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,283
Then he might not be psychic at--

182
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,995
That's what
our hardworking Gwang-sik said too.

183
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,372
But I'm positive he's also psychic.

184
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,249
Then how does he see people's--

185
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,710
We don't know that yet,

186
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,087
but he could also have
some kind of disadvantage.

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,672
So he might not know about

188
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,175
our hardworking and quick-witted
Gwang-sik being psychic.

189
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,844
I thought you said
that he found out about Gwang-sik

190
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,388
by touching me and seeing my memories.

191
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,599
It's an assumption, not a fact.

192
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,767
So we need to question everything.

193
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,228
Sure, whatever you say.

194
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,148
Let's first put all those people
back on the suspect list

195
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,900
and think of a different plan.

196
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,027
You two may have been
exposed to the killer,

197
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,904
so lay low for the time being.

198
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,698
I'll investigate the suspects first.

199
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,018
Check out the dash cams
in the witnesses' cars, okay?

200
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,480
REAL ESTATE

201
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,689
Hello.

202
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,608
Hey, Jong-muk.

203
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,567
Hi, sir.

204
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,613
Is everything all right these days?

205
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,242
We're still breathing, so yes.

206
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,997
You two have lived in Mujin
for a long time, right?

207
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,750
A long time indeed.

208
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,047
Then you must remember the redevelopment
that was being discussed

209
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,757
over a decade ago.

210
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,217
Of course.

211
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,635
Don't get me started.

212
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,720
Mujin was practically destroyed back then.

213
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,889
This guy here bought some land

214
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,227
that they said was going to be redeveloped
and lost all that money.

215
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,479
He still walks on eggshells
around his wife.

216
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,107
Speak for yourself.

217
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,818
Your wife almost divorced you
when you were 57.

218
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,320
She refused to make you any food,

219
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,866
so you would eat
unseasoned ark clams for every meal.

220
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,244
I guess there were
a lot of ark clams back then?

221
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,787
Of course.

222
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,873
Mujin was known for ark clams.

223
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,166
We even used to have ark clam festivals.

224
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,378
The government put in a lot of effort

225
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,173
hoping the festival would help Mujin
become a special tourist zone.

226
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,051
The city redevelopment rumors
were going around at the time.

227
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,512
And we were told
that we'd be hitting the jackpot

228
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,892
as apartment buildings and resorts
will be built on the land we owned.

229
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,395
So we all bought a bunch of land
at a premium price.

230
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,273
But the redevelopment never happened.

231
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,983
Exactly.

232
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,527
And guess who got to earn all the money?

233
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,946
Who?

234
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,073
Who else? Yoon Deok-hyeon, of course.

235
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,535
He was Mujin's assemblyman
for a long time.

236
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,789
Almost all of the land here was his,

237
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,751
and he sold it all
when the land prices rose.

238
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,587
Thanks to that, he went to Seoul

239
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,964
and became a government minister.

240
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,385
So the only person who benefited

241
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:33,098
from the redevelopment rumors
was that Assemblyman Yoon?

242
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,142
As far as I know,

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,230
Cha Ju-man also pocketed
some money back then.

244
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
Assemblyman Cha Ju-man?

245
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,361
That's right.

246
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,075
Cha Ju-man was basically
Assemblyman Yoon's lackey back then.

247
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,827
Even if he only got a small cut,

248
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,996
he would've gotten
hundreds of millions of won.

249
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,418
Here.

250
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,254
Everyone take one.

251
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,173
-The prawn festival?
-What is this?

252
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,175
Please take a look. All right.

253
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,510
It's the prawn festival.

254
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,929
Pass these around in the back.

255
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,472
"Prawn Festival Singing Competition"?

256
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,768
You all know that the Mujin Prawn Festival
is in a couple of days, right?

257
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,019
-Yes.
-Yes.

258
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,814
It's an annual festival,

259
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:26,443
so you all have to come
this time too, okay?

260
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,862
-Of course.
-We will.

261
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,867
There's a serial killer on the loose,

262
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,245
and you're talking about some festival?

263
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,287
That's right.

264
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,707
Why create a scene like this?

265
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,668
We should all be hiding at our homes
at a time like this.

266
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,587
Why should we be hiding at home?
We're not the criminals here.

267
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,797
-That's right.
-Right.

268
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,008
That's right. Well said.

269
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,384
-Right.
-Exactly.

270
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:55,389
At a time like this,
we need to stick together

271
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,643
so the serial killer
can't even dream about attacking us.

272
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,895
This just doesn't feel right.

273
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,772
Can't we skip the festival this year?

274
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,736
-That'd be a shame.
-Hello, everyone.

275
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,573
There's no need.

276
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,657
Please sit.

277
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,576
Let's sit down.

278
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,289
Assemblyman Cha, what brings you here?

279
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,291
I was just passing by

280
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,543
and wanted to thank everyone
for their support.

281
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,839
Were you all discussing something?

282
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,885
Yes, we were discussing
the prawn festival.

283
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,305
But given the circumstances right now,

284
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,100
we were wondering
if we should just skip this year.

285
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,018
What?

286
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,646
We can't have that.

287
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,024
We can't give up
this amazing tourism opportunity.

288
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,735
Mujin's reputation
can be ruined in an instant.

289
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,488
If the rumor gets out
that there is a serial killer here,

290
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,073
no tourists will come here.

291
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,200
And our economy will collapse overnight.

292
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,203
No one would even come here to fish
because they'd be so scared.

293
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,790
-That's true.
-I agree.

294
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,374
At a time like this,

295
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,627
there's nothing
more effective than a festival

296
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,838
to restore Mujin's original image
as a clean and safe city.

297
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,800
The prawn festival is our pride.

298
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,928
We should make it
even more extravagant to attract tourists.

299
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,846
And this could be an opportunity to show

300
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,890
that our lands are
good for building houses

301
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,850
and running lodging businesses.

302
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,144
That's right!

303
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,897
That's our assemblyman!

304
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,612
Mujin needs to be known
as a safe city to live in

305
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,323
in order for
another wave of redevelopment.

306
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,700
Redevelopment wave?

307
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,244
Redevelopment wave!

308
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,703
Yes, that's right!

309
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,747
-That's right!
-He's right!

310
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,757
CLEAN AND SAFE MUJIN, PUSHING AHEAD
FOR SPECIAL TOURIST ZONE DESIGNATION

311
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,051
ASSEMBLYMAN YOON DEOK-HYEON
ELECTED FOR A THIRD TERM!

312
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,059
INQUIRY REPORT
NAME: CHA JU-MAN

313
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,898
INQUIRY REPORT
NAME: KIM SEON-WOO

314
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,320
Here's some coffee.

315
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,572
-Coffee for you.
-Thanks.

316
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,075
INQUIRY REPORT
NAME: HA SEONG-MIN

317
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,327
What are you two looking at so intently?

318
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,997
It's nothing.

319
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,209
What's that?

320
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,754
They sent us a request for support
regarding the upcoming prawn festival.

321
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,175
It's already time for the prawn festival?

322
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,217
A prawn festival?

323
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,679
It's the biggest event in the city
that takes place every year.

324
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,640
I think this is the fifth year.

325
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,225
What do they want us to do there?

326
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,311
Keep traffic in order and patrol the area.

327
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,522
You must be kidding me.

328
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:55,360
But is it really okay to have a festival
in a situation like this?

329
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,198
Assemblyman Cha
never missed the festival while in office.

330
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,742
Since he was reelected,
he'll definitely push it through.

331
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,536
He's just as stubborn

332
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,997
as a certain someone.

333
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,081
He really is.

334
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,127
If this is a local festival,

335
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,962
do a lot of people attend this?

336
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,715
Yes, almost everyone
from the neighborhood will come.

337
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,801
And there are a lot of activities too.

338
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,804
There's a singing competition,
a village photo exhibition,

339
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,892
performances by artists,
food experiences, and street games.

340
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,604
Everyone in the neighborhood
would be participating.

341
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,982
Is that so?

342
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,445
THE FIFTH ANNUAL PRAWN FESTIVAL

343
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,030
What is this?

344
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,157
I heard this is the biggest
yearly event here.

345
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,617
Everyone will be there.

346
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,826
That's right.

347
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,828
I sell milk there every year.

348
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,748
Exactly.

349
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,501
We're going to track down
the psychic on this day.

350
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,962
He may be able to hide his crimes
by closing his eyes.

351
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,172
But he can't hide his memory
of the night of the meteor shower

352
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,632
because that was before he got his power.

353
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,509
You can use your powers

354
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,263
to identify who was hiding behind
the pillar that night.

355
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,224
He'd be the psychic and our serial killer.

356
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,855
But the killer knows our faces
and that we're psychic.

357
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,524
Will he let us touch him?

358
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,151
That's why we need a plan.

359
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,319
What kind of plan?

360
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,031
Gwang-sik can set up
the milk booth as usual

361
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,285
and advertise about
complimentary foot massages.

362
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,747
If the killer doesn't know you're psychic,
he'll take you up on that offer.

363
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,959
But if he does know about your power,

364
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,420
he'll try to avoid
getting a massage at all costs.

365
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,588
And after that?

366
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,383
We'll have to lure him to you,
Bong Ye-bun.

367
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,760
It'll be harder for me to touch him.

368
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,139
He wouldn't let me touch his butt
when he knows my face.

369
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,140
I know.

370
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,686
We need a way for you to touch him
without him knowing.

371
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,402
He always comes up with a vague idea
and then tells me to find a way.

372
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,663
GENERAL MACARTHUR TV

373
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,089
Hello.

374
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,466
Dr. Bong.

375
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,509
What brings you here?

376
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,179
I was just passing by.

377
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,264
Where's Justin?

378
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,475
I just put him to bed.

379
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,643
He's still not used to sleeping here,

380
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,771
so I had to walk around
with him on my back.

381
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,565
You're such a good dad.

382
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,195
I call myself his dad,
but I can't even communicate with him.

383
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,362
It's frustrating.

384
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,199
But you're learning English from Seon-woo.

385
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,533
You'll get better.

386
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,079
I'm worried about how it'll cost me
more and more to raise him.

387
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,833
And the only thing I can do for a living
is just this sort of thing.

388
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,879
By the way, where's Seon-woo?

389
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,258
I asked him for a favor,
so he went out to get some wood.

390
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,343
Wood?

391
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,344
Yes.

392
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,846
I'm planning on opening
a fortune teller booth

393
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,014
for the prawn festival.

394
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,891
A fortune teller booth?

395
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,602
Yes, there might be some tourists

396
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,063
who want to have
their fortunes read for fun.

397
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,273
I heard young couples these days

398
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:24,111
have a lot of interest in tarot cards
and stuff like that, so it could do well.

399
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,655
Really? That'd be great.

400
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,282
So Seon-woo is…

401
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,201
He's making my booth.

402
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,205
Hey, Seon-woo.

403
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,873
Hi, Dr. Bong.

404
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,584
Were you able to get the wood?

405
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,837
Yes, I got almost everything I need.

406
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,215
Seon-woo,
I heard you were helping Mr. Park.

407
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,300
Is there anything I can help you with?

408
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:08,864
Really?

409
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,369
Did you think of this?

410
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,745
I did.

411
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,498
You really are a genius.

412
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,459
I think people will really love…

413
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,044
NUTJOB

414
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,839
You love him to death, don't you?

415
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,092
Keep that up, and you'll actually die.

416
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,770
Seon-woo,

417
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,731
I'll get going now.

418
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,824
Are you stalking me?

419
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,659
This isn't the time to be dating guys.

420
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,495
I'm not dating.
I'm just helping out someone.

421
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,788
Helping out someone? How?

422
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,875
Mr. Park is setting up
a fortune teller booth at the festival

423
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,960
to earn money to support his son.

424
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,421
And Seon-woo is going to make the booth.

425
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:10,175
When people put their hands into it,
Mr. Park is going to read their palms.

426
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,303
Seon-woo came up with the idea.
Isn't that so impressive?

427
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,348
He's such a good guy
that he always finds ways to help others.

428
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,975
Is that why he's named Seon-woo?

429
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,561
Because Seon-woo's like a ray of sunshine?

430
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,272
That's a great idea.

431
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,943
You're going to read
people's fortunes with me?

432
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,028
Why?

433
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,197
I want to help you make a lot of money.

434
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,157
You know I have a power, right?

435
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,827
I want to test out my abilities
while you make money.

436
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,079
It's a win-win situation.

437
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,540
So you read the fortunes

438
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
while the general and I
rake in all the money?

439
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,921
But no one can know it's me.

440
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,173
I'll be in a difficult position
if word spreads.

441
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,259
That'd be great for me.

442
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,929
But how can you read fortunes
without revealing your identity?

443
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,556
You need to be face-to-face.

444
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,016
About that…

445
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,143
Could you lean in?

446
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,152
Sorry for putting you
through so much trouble.

447
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,946
Not at all. It's fun.

448
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,909
But about our Hand of Truth booth…

449
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,286
Yes?

450
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,289
I'm sorry, but can we switch it
to something else?

451
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,041
Something else? Like what?

452
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,211
To "The Butt of Truth."

453
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,213
Butt?

454
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,466
Remember the TV show, The Knee-Drop Guru,

455
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,720
where the guru could see everything
before your knees touched the floor?

456
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,390
So I was thinking I could be the guru
who can see everything

457
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,309
before your butt hits the chair.

458
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,896
I'll prepare a cushion or something
for the customers to sit on,

459
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,024
so please just make a hole in the chair.

460
00:26:55,113 --> 00:27:00,118
THE FIFTH ANNUAL PRAWN FESTIVAL

461
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,204
Today is D-day.

462
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,873
Everyone keep this in mind.

463
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,251
It's important to find out
who the psychic is,

464
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,838
but it's just as important
to not let him read our memories.

465
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,674
He might find out about our plan.

466
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,677
We don't know what he's capable of,

467
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,512
but we have to be careful nonetheless.

468
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,600
We need to touch the killer
without letting him touch us.

469
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,019
Everyone's a suspect, understand?

470
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,437
-Yes.
-Yes.

471
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,899
-Especially you, Bong Ye-bun.
-Sorry?

472
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,275
If Kim Seon-woo asks you,

473
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,404
"Do you want to have some soju
and grilled prawns with me?"

474
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,947
How should you respond?

475
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,741
I'd love to.

476
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,078
No, you have to say no!

477
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,082
No.

478
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,250
You're worrying me.

479
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,668
Let's try again.

480
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,048
What if he says,
"Do you want to go somewhere quiet?"

481
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,720
No.

482
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,138
Good job.

483
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,600
"Ye-bun, close your eyes."

484
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,018
No!

485
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,398
Why are you sticking your lips out?

486
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,899
This is not okay!

487
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,402
Kim Seon-woo is our prime suspect.

488
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,864
We need to find the person
who was standing behind that pillar

489
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,699
on the night of the meteor shower.

490
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,494
Ok-hui, I'll tell you the suspects
over the walkie-talkie,

491
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,454
so lure them to the booth
as naturally as you can.

492
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,831
Okay.

493
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,013

THE BUTT OF TRUTH

499
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,414
Goodness, Mr. Kim.

500
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,332
This is amazing.

501
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,376
I'm not sure if it's what you envisioned.

502
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,794
It's incredible.

503
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,019
Can everyone hear me?

504
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,731
Yes, I can hear you.

505
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,816
Yes, I can hear you well.

506
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,865
I can hear you.

507
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,242
Can you hear me?

508
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes, I can hear you.

509
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,837
Act natural so our plan
doesn't get discovered.

510
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,132
The psychic is definitely somewhere here.

511
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,009
-Yes.
-Yes.

512
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,888
Good morning, dear citizens of Mujin!

513
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,141
THE FIFTH MUJIN PRAWN FESTIVAL
SINGING COMPETITION

514
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,562
I am Mujin's assemblyman, Cha Ju-man.

515
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,233
First and foremost,
I want to thank the citizens here

516
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,069
for all the hard work they put
into this festival.

517
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,656
With the Fifth Annual Prawn Festival,

518
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,036
I hope that there will be many visitors
and that it vitalizes our local economy.

519
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,916
I, Cha Ju-man,
will do everything in my power

520
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,628
to let the nation know Mujin's potential

521
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,464
and have Mujin designated
as a special tourist zone!

522
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,223
-Let's go, Mujin!
-Let's go!

523
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,975
-Captain, have this.
-Thanks.

524
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,477
Pretty big turnout like you said,
Detective Na.

525
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,854
What did I tell you?

526
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,314
I knew Assemblyman Cha
would push it through.

527
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,609
We're not here to enjoy things.

528
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,320
Focus on patrolling the area.

529
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,824
I have a feeling that something big
is going to go down today.

530
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,419
Anyway, where's Detective Moon?

531
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,923
The locals are starting to arrive.

532
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,261
The suspects are Choi Il-han, Cho Mun-ui,
Ha Seong-min, and Cho Sang-gu.

533
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,014
Lead them to Gwang-sik's booth.

534
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,183
Hello!

535
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,477
Hi, Ok-hui.

536
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,937
Are you here for the festival?

537
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,147
No.

538
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,318
I stopped by while buying fertilizer
because it was so loud over here.

539
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,736
Fertilizer? Why?

540
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,112
Are you planting garlic?

541
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,072
You can't leave your land untended.

542
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,242
Didn't you plant bellflower roots
this time last year?

543
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,911
I did.

544
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,205
And they gave me such a hard time
that I heard my own funeral bells.

545
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,958
Is that why they're called
"bellflower roots"?

546
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,920
You see,

547
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,673
water deers are crazy
about bellflower shoots--

548
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,426
Gwang-sik said
he was going to plant them this year.

549
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,387
You dummy.

550
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,557
Why would you plant bellflower roots?

551
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:21,022
Come on, they're delicious when they're
tossed with squid and spicy sauce.

552
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,692
Everything tastes delicious when
tossed with squid and spicy sauce.

553
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,070
You shouldn't plant bellflower roots.

554
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,783
Want to know
how a squid beat a shark in a fight?

555
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,495
That's easy. Because it was well-armed.

556
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,876
That feels good.

557
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,420
-Rest up.
-Okay.

558
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,050
Gosh, my back.

559
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,683
Isn't it nice to be out like this?
It's been so long.

560
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,351
It is.

561
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,981
What is it now?

562
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,440
I didn't come to see you.

563
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,317
I came to see my father-in-law.

564
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,154
Father, did you know

565
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,408
that our divorce wasn't my fault?

566
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:18,162
It seems that Hyeon-ok had some other man
in her heart when she was with me.

567
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,709
There he is. That other man.

568
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,128
Father, it's not like that.

569
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,130
Listen to what I have to say first before…

570
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,383
Hello.

571
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,593
Hello, sir.

572
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,762
Did you come to enjoy the festival?

573
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,848
Yes, I did.

574
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,225
Thanks for all your hard work.

575
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,520
Why don't I show you around?

576
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,356
I'd be grateful if you did.

577
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,151
Okay, then let's go this way.

578
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,528
Right, this way.

579
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:03,166
I need to stop by somewhere.

580
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,251
You guys go ahead.

581
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,545
Okay.

582
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,298
Father, where are you…

583
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,637
-Have you eaten?
-What?

584
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,598
No, but I'm fine.

585
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,349
You must be tired.

586
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,185
I'm fine, don't worry.

587
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,146
-Come here.
-I'm really fine.

588
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,105
Just come here.

589
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,315
-Jeez.
-Hello.

590
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,691
Yes, hello.

591
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,486
Captain Won is also a suspect
since he ran into Dr. Bong that night.

592
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,072
Please lead them both
to "The Butt of Truth."

593
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,575
-Yes, sis.
-It's good.

594
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,619
We'll get on it now.

595
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,249
-I'll peel it for you.
-Hello.

596
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,085
Hello.

597
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,587
You look so good-natured, sir.

598
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,677
I've never heard someone
say that about me before.

599
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,140
Let me guess,
your work has been quite grueling?

600
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,312
We police officers can't really
complain about work being hard.

601
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,314
You're a police officer?

602
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,441
Yes, why?

603
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,778
You don't really have the face
for a police officer.

604
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,739
What's wrong with my face?

605
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,327
This is all because
your ancestors are angry.

606
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,372
People end up with faces like yours
when they've angered their ancestors.

607
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,586
Why are you agreeing with that?

608
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,965
THE BUTT OF TRUTH

609
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,926
Won Jong-muk and Jung Hyeon-ok.
Fifty-five and fifty-one respectively.

610
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,179
They dated in their early twenties,
but my grandfather broke them up.

611
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,560
Oh, my.

612
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,436
You two are

613
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,981
Romeo and Juliet.

614
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,109
What?

615
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,529
You were each other's first love,
but you couldn't get your happy ending.

616
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,448
Oh, my gosh.

617
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,284
You're really good!

618
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,704
Then can you see how we'll end up too?

619
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,999
Tell them to try
"The Butt of Truth" to know more.

620
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,421
If you're curious,

621
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,424
please have a seat here.

622
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,676
"The Butt of Truth."

623
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,760
THE BUTT OF TRUTH

624
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,141
Try it, Jong-muk.

625
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,686
Here?

626
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,356
Hey, I'm busy.

627
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,662
The captain
wasn't near the barn that night.

628
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,003
This is why I'm here.

629
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,380
What is this?

630
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,469
It's a case I've been investigating
for a long time.

631
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,723
I don't think I'll be able to
investigate it anymore,

632
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,392
so I came here to ask you to take it on.

633
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,561
Me?

634
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,654
Aren't you supposed to tell me things?

635
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,664
I can't see.

636
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,419
He met my grandfather recently.

637
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,592
I see that you met

638
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,637
Dr. Bong's grandfather recently.

639
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,308
You met with my father?

640
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,229
Yes, I did.

641
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,564
What did you two talk about?

642
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,235
Nothing special.

643
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:06,075
How fascinating. How did you know that?

644
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,161
That's why it's called
"The Butt of Truth."

645
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,456
You can't hide anything here.

646
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,084
Shall I try it too?

647
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,419
Go ahead.

648
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,730
Mi-ok!

649
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,398
Hyeon-ok.

650
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,941
REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
INVESTIGATE THE TRUTH

651
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,193
You're a journalist!

652
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,571
Why are you protesting with them
instead of interviewing them?

653
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,158
There are so many people
who got forced out onto the streets.

654
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,534
-Investigate!
-It's so sad.

655
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:52,371
At this rate, you and your daughter
will end up on the streets too.

656
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,664
-Arrest them!
-Arrest them!

657
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,291
I can't come home tonight either.

658
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,460
Please make sure Ye-bun eats.

659
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,045
-You're killing us!
-You're killing us!

660
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,004
Bye.

661
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,691
Mom.

662
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,536
How long do I have to sit here?

663
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,546
That's so strange.
I can't see anything today.

664
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,593
I knew this was a sham. Let's go.

665
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,767
It's Kim Seon-woo.

666
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,561
He's our prime suspect, so focus.

667
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,776
Justin wanted some milk.

668
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,570
Could we get a glass?

669
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,030
Of course.

670
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:09,865
Here.

671
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,166
-Thank you.
-No problem.

672
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,794
-We can't let him get away.
-Actually!

673
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,087
Yes?

674
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,550
Since you came all the way here,
why don't you get a foot massage?

675
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,717
No, thank you.

676
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,264
I'm really good at massages,
and it's free.

677
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,641
Thank you, but I'm good.

678
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,228
Come on, it's not polite to disregard
someone's sincere offer.

679
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,402
I'll really have to decline.

680
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,075
Okay then.

681
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,887
What do you mean? I am patrolling.

682
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,641
He's on the suspect list,
but he can't be the killer.

683
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,185
A quick check will do.

684
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,113
Hello.

685
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,618
-Is there a lot of traffic?
-Yes, there are a lot of cars.

686
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,161
It's opening up.

687
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,454
Yes, it's opened up.

688
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,830
You may go.

689
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,915
Goodbye.

690
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,466
Here too.

691
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,384
Are you going to stay here all day?

692
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,678
-Is it over?
-Yes.

693
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,847
All right. That felt great, thank you.

694
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,474
-No problem.
-Have a good day.

695
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,355
-There wasn't much, right?
-No there wasn't.

696
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:08,400
But I saw Kim Seon-woo
going toward Mount Mujin.

697
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,071
How far is Mount Mujin from the barn?

698
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:17,409
Once you come down the mountain,
the barn is right across the street.

699
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,577
It's quite close.

700
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,997
Let's change the plan.

701
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,167
It's highly likely that Kim Seon-woo
was near the barn that night.

702
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,712
Try to locate Kim Seon-woo
as you touch other people.

703
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,714
But it can't be him.

704
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,968
Don't forget,

705
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,012
we're chasing after
a serial killer right now.

706
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,231
What a great spot you have.

707
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,816
-Hello, Mr. Cha.
-Hello.

708
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,651
Please make a wish that I get elected.

709
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,902
Don't you worry.

710
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,071
Of course you will.

711
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,491
There's no doubt about it.

712
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,410
-You've got this.
-I'll get going now.

713
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,161
Make way for the car, please.

714
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,914
Please move to the side.

715
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,376
Did you see anything?

716
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,216
Seon-woo was following Assemblyman Cha.

717
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,802
He was pulling something out of his bag.

718
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,262
What was it?

719
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,805
I'm not sure.

720
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,601
But Detective Na was right behind him
so she could've seen it.

721
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,728
Detective Na?

722
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,731
Detective Na.

723
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,733
Hello.

724
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,695
Did you get something done?
You look so much prettier.

725
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:36,780
I do?

726
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,865
Yes.

727
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,534
Be honest with me.
You had something done, didn't you?

728
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,456
Dermal fillers for my smile lines.

729
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,542
Botox in my cheeks
and a little in my forehead.

730
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,294
And a nonsurgical nose job.

731
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,712
Seriously?

732
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,298
What? They came out so well.

733
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,257
Really?

734
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,595
How about a glass of milk for our skins
while we have a little chat?

735
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,348
But I'm working right now.

736
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,059
Come on, your beauty
is doing all the work already.

737
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,312
I guess that's true.

738
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,731
Let's go.

739
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,738
Isn't it good?

740
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,947
It's so flavorful.

741
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,659
I'm giving free foot massages as well.

742
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:22,826
Take a seat.

743
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,749
My husband wouldn't like that.

744
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,959
He goes around touching anybody he wants,

745
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,212
but he hates it when someone touches me.

746
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,673
But he never touches me either.

747
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,175
It's driving me crazy.

748
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,259
In that case,

749
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,637
you should go visit the shaman.

750
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,307
I've bought countless talismans from him,
but they never work.

751
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,851
He got his power back recently,

752
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,978
and he's right on the nose about things.

753
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:51,772
Really?

754
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,856
Yes.

755
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,825
Hi, everyone.

756
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,868
It's me, Streamer Ms. Si-a.

757
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,580
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND, DON'T YOU?
HYPOCRITES LIKE YOU MUST DIE!

758
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,546
DELETE

759
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,506
Please move to the side.

760
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,175
It's not that way, Mr. Cha!

761
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,601
It was just a flyer.

762
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,020
I'm telling you
he would never harm anyone.

763
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,730
What about Detective Na?

764
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,401
There's nothing unusual about her.

765
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:44,074
But why does Kim Seon-woo
keep crossing paths with Assemblyman Cha?

766
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,217
I'm seeing it now.

767
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,594
Forget it.

768
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,597
Just tell me
if my husband is cheating on me.

769
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,063
I'm seeing him now.

770
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,569
Over there.

771
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,491
That son of a…

772
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:35,459
The Prawn Festival Singing Competition
will begin in 30 minutes.

773
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,712
I hope many of you will participate.

774
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,424
Sis!

775
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,469
Sis!

776
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,473
Sis, didn't you hear me calling you?

777
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,601
I signed us up
for the singing competition.

778
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,438
Let's make a nice memory together, sis.

779
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,440
-Yong-myeong.
-Yes?

780
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,611
I've never had a break from dating
my whole life.

781
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,030
But I think I have to now.

782
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,907
-What?
-I think it's time for a break.

783
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,286
Then how about we take a break
from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.?

784
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,831
Then at 6 p.m.,
we can step on the gas and vroom.

785
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,667
Like that…

786
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,754
If you no longer find their jokes funny,

787
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,382
it's over between you two.

788
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,926
Like right now.

789
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:34,142
I load up all my feelings and leave

790
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,896
Far away from you

791
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,942
Prawn!

792
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,908
The next participant
is Mujin High School's French teacher,

793
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,868
Kim Yong-myeong,

794
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,203
singing, "Prawn In My Ear."

795
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,997
Please give him a round of applause!

796
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:22,399
Tell me what you want me to say

797
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:26,236
Whatever you say will make me fly

798
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,363
-I love you
-I love you

799
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,115
-I love you
-I love you

800
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,702
Whatever you want to hear
I'll whisper it in your ear

801
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,746
-I love you
-I love you

802
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,539
-I love you
-I love you

803
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,667
So savory that I hardly make sense of it

804
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,294
-Prawn in my ear
-Prawn in my ear

805
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,338
-So savory like sesame seeds
-So savory like sesame seeds

806
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,548
Melt me away

807
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,133
With your voice

808
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,184
-Prawn in my ear
-Prawn!

809
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,855
Prawn!

810
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,275
What an extraordinary performance.

811
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,860
Are you enjoying yourselves?

812
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:08,403
-Yes!
-Yes!

813
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,114
Next up is Bong's Animal Hospital's nurse,

814
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,950
Jung Hyeon-ok, singing "Sparks"!

815
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,495
Just stay where you are.

816
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,038
I'll be back.

817
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:18,955
Let go!

818
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,930
My burning feelings

819
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,015
Jong-muk, where are you going?

820
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,184
Jong-muk!

821
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,145
In the prawn shop in our neighborhood…

822
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,356
When that girl was surprised

823
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,281
Samba

824
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,204
I'm so exhausted
Bumblebee

825
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,580
-Bumblebee!
-Bumblebee!

826
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,170
Do you want one too?

827
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,048
Forget it, I'm too old for that.

828
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,008
I'm a police officer.

829
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,720
I've spent half my life with guns.
Follow me.

830
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,055
I'm going to win you everything.

831
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,407
What happened?

832
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,659
I think your eyes are getting too old.

833
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,494
It's not that.

834
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,538
I was supposed to hit a cute teddy bear,

835
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,667
and I did hit
my cutie over here, didn't I?

836
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,880
Come on.

837
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,174
Maybe I hit my cutie too hard.

838
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,885
-You're not crying, are you?
-No, but blow on it.

839
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,595
I'll give you a ride home.

840
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,637
Okay.

841
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:13,904
What is this?

842
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,156
Oh, that?

843
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,407
MUJIN REDEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE PROTEST

844
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,868
What is this? Why is this in your car?

845
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,250
This is the last article my sister wrote.

846
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,796
She was investigating this case.

847
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,464
She worked so hard on it,

848
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:36,426
but she died
before she could finish investigating it.

849
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,138
What?

850
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,938
Ok-hui.

851
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,899
Bring Dr. Jung to Gwang-sik's booth.

852
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,568
We have to check my grandfather too?

853
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,862
He's the best person to confirm
where Kim Seon-woo went.

854
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,449
And you ran into him
during the Lee Ji-suk incident too.

855
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
Ok-hui.

856
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:03,995
Ok-hui.

857
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,164
Can't you hear me?

858
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:11,336
Now, let me announce
the winner of the Grand Prize.

859
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,965
The winner gave
a truly astonishing performance.

860
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,258
Prawn in my ear

861
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,594
Team Kim Yong-myeong!

862
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,140
Here you go.

863
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,893
Should I give the prize to both of you?

864
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,146
A 55-inch TV for our first-place winner!

865
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,780
Hello, sir.

866
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,783
You're the detective.

867
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,286
What's with the milk?

868
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,663
I'm volunteering for the community today.

869
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,791
And Gwang-sik needed a hand for his booth.

870
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,919
This is fresh milk. Have some.

871
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,927
It's very flavorful.

872
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:01,970
It is.

873
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,477
Oh, no.

874
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,858
Why don't you visit the booth over there

875
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:17,777
and get a foot massage to wind down?

876
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,695
It's free.

877
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,864
The chair is comfortable too.

878
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,782
That's…

879
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,367
Well…

880
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:44,137
Thank you for today.

881
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,513
-Take him home.
-Okay.

882
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,349
No, it's fine.

883
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,768
I can just get a ride from anyone.

884
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:51,937
You'll need your car.

885
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,854
But still…

886
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,939
It's fine.

887
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,440
I'll get going.

888
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,159
Did you arrange the meeting?

889
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,077
Well…

890
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,002
Did you arrange the meeting?

891
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,505
He insisted
that it would make no difference.

892
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,464
Where is he now?

893
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,715
At his barn, sir.

894
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,633
Let's go there.

895
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,385
You're going to meet Jeon Dong-yeol?

896
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,928
Then who else, a celebrity?

897
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,971
Okay, sir.

898
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,102
So Kim Seon-woo wasn't seen after that.

899
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,229
But…

900
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,983
Assemblyman Cha came to the barn that day.

901
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,818
What? Why?

902
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,654
I think he came to meet my father.

903
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,364
Around what time?

904
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,700
It was before we got hit
with the meteor shower.

905
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,952
You didn't know he was there at the time?

906
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,372
I was with Dr. Bong looking after Geumsil.

907
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:57,377
So could Mr. Cha be the psychic?

908
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,379
We'll know once we find out.

909
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,758
Hello.

910
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,052
Thank you for your hard work.

911
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,056
Mr. Cha!

912
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,892
Hi, Ok-hui. Your dancing was phenomenal.

913
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,478
-Congratulations on winning first place.
-Thank you.

914
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,980
Mr. Cha,

915
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,399
can we take a photo to commemorate this?

916
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,692
Sure.

917
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,610
Let's stand over here.

918
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,737
Okay.

919
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,321
One, two, three.

920
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,200
Let's go.

921
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,327
Look at this. It came out so nicely.

922
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,912
Look, doesn't it look great?

923
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,955
How fun.

924
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,833
It says he can see everything
before your butt hits the chair.

925
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:37,876
How fun indeed.

926
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,045
I sat there earlier,

927
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:44,132
and he told me everything about my future.

928
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,508
It doesn't end there.

929
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,719
He got everything right
about my past, too.

930
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,179
Your past?

931
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,722
Really? How fascinating.

932
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,766
-Let's go.
-Mr. Cha,

933
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,893
you should try it too.

934
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,478
No, I'll try next time.

935
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,979
I'm with the press right now, so…

936
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:58,938
Okay, let's go.

937
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,398
Why not?

938
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,358
Wouldn't it be great for the article?

939
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:06,571
It would be good to show you
enjoying the local festival.

940
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,449
Is that so?

941
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,993
Yes, we'll write up a nice story for you.

942
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,745
Let's go.

943
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,582
-Come on.
-Then shall I give it a try?

944
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,252
Hello there.

945
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,338
Hello, Assemblyman Cha.

946
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,132
Everyone's saying
that you're an expert at reading fortunes.

947
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,675
Thank you for saying that.

948
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,512
Do I just need to sit here?

949
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,971
Yes, have a seat.

950
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:36,851
Goodness.

951
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,396
Focus, Bong Ye-bun.

952
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:42,816
Mr. Park,

953
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,777
use your power
and tell him a lot of good things.

954
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,779
-Then he'll believe you.
-Right now?

955
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,699
Right now…

956
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,954
I can feel that you have
such a special energy.

957
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:01,793
Let's see.

958
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,549
Sir, have you given it some thought?

959
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:09,884
How many times do I have to tell you?

960
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,845
I told you that I'm not selling it.

961
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,471
Please think about it again.

962
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,266
If we build a resort on your land,

963
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:20,145
this place will be the beginning
of a new chapter in Mujin's history.

964
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,273
I'll give you two million won per pyeong.

965
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,108
The others got less than 1.5 million.

966
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,359
Forget it.

967
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:31,406
I'm going to give this land
to Gwang-sik just as it is,

968
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,699
and that's that.

969
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,244
Then let me have a talk with Gwang-sik.

970
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,246
Don't waste your time.

971
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,547
Sir!

972
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,549
You have to take this call.

973
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,218
-Who is it?
-The representative of the Central Party.

974
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,554
Hello, Cha Ju-man speaking.

975
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,181
Not at all.

976
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,850
What the… The call just dropped.

977
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,935
Hello, I'm sorry. The call dropped.

978
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,229
Thank you.

979
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,731
It's all thanks to you.

980
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,400
It's not Mr. Cha.

981
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:11,196
Considering the direction he was going,
Kim Seon-woo might be somewhere nearby.

982
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,490
Are you sure you didn't miss anything?

983
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,908
I don't see…

984
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:18,453
Wait.

985
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,502
You have to take this call.

986
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,087
-Who is it?
-The representative of the Central Party.

987
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,216
There's someone there.

988
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,222
-It's Mr. Park.
-What?

989
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,433
Let's see.

990
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,670
Mr. Cha, what happened to my mom?

991
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:12,090
The rescuers smashed the car window
and pulled her out,

992
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,092
but they were too late.

993
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,718
Mom, wake up.

994
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,012
Wake up, Mom!

995
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,528
Gwang-sik.

996
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,446
Can you try and touch the shaman?

997
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,825
Jong-bae.

998
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,493
You must be so thirsty.

999
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,245
-Have a seat over here.
-What?

1000
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,624
Try this. I boiled the milk with sugar,
and it tastes amazing.

1001
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,502
Thank you.

1002
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,547
Looks like
I always get free stuff from you.

1003
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,007
I…

1004
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:56,467
I have nothing to give you in return, but…

1005
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,720
let me see your hand.

1006
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,930
I'll read your palm.

1007
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,352
Come on. I've had my ups and downs,

1008
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,645
but I read palms well.

1009
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,814
No, it's okay.

1010
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,190
My hands are too dirty.

1011
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,735
It's okay. Come here.

1012
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,113
Your shoelace is untied.

1013
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,031
What?

1014
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,826
They're fine.

1015
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,661
They may come loose soon.

1016
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,371
I'll retie it for you.

1017
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,206
Yeah?

1018
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,459
All right then.

1019
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:36,007
General MacArthur of Mount Mujin.

1020
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,553
Open up my mind
and open the door to this mountain.

1021
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,514
Run through my body and mind.

1022
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:48,102
Dear General MacArthur.

1023
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,566
I should've just stuck to the trail.

1024
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,277
This is taking even longer.

1025
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,884
What is that?

1026
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:22,887
Did I come the opposite way?

1027
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,307
He was there.

1028
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,102
-The shaman?
-No. Kim Seon-woo.

1029
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,897
He was behind that pillar
on the night of the meteor shower!

1030
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:43,092
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

1031
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,094
Bong Ye-bun, is something wrong?

1032
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,139
What were you thinking about all alone?
You looked sad.

1033
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,766
Do you really think
he's the serial killer?

1034
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,058
Shouldn't you catch him quick?

1035
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,518
He might kill again.

1036
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,854
But why did you ask me to look into him?

1037
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,190
Then why were you collecting
Mi-ok's articles?

1038
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,941
Why are you digging into something

1039
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,777
that happened over a decade ago?
What is this about?

1040
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,487
What are you hiding from me?

1041
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,324
If we follow that data,
we'll find out why she died.

1042
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,909
Your sister

1043
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,161
didn't kill herself.

1044
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,288
I almost misunderstood you, Dr. Jung.

1045
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,583
It's been a while since I visited Mi-ok.

1046
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,668
You should head home now.

1047
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,088
I want to know the reason
why my mom committed suicide.

1048
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:28,054
