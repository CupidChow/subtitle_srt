1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,897
Ye-bun.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,399
Did you bring in my underwear?

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,068
No, why?

5
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,528
I left it out to dry, but it's gone.

6
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,073
Maybe it was blown away by the wind.

7
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,199
Maybe.

8
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,617
I'll go out and check.

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,119
Have a nice day, Father.

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,008
Hey.

11
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,010
Why did you just sit there
and stare at him

12
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,222
without even saying bye?

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,933
He never responds anyway.

14
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,228
He just looks at me blankly
no matter what I do.

15
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,232
Why are you being so cold today?

16
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,608
I've always been like this.

17
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,905
But you seem especially cold today.

18
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,366
That girl.

19
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,494
MUJIN POLICE STATION

20
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,081
All the underwear
that I hung up to dry disappeared.

21
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,624
This is already the second time.

22
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,000
So the thing is,

23
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,130
I bought a set of rainbow-colored panties
for all the days of the week

24
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,549
from a home shopping channel
for 39,900 won.

25
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,800
Red, orange, yellow…

26
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,510
My yellow one went missing.

27
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,011
And that means,

28
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,097
I have no panties to wear on Wednesdays!

29
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,141
But today is Wednesday.

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,184
And that means,

31
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm going comman--

32
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,105
Don't! You can stop now.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,191
SANG-JUN, MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION

34
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,947
Please take over.

35
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,365
My panties…

36
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,539
That rude little jerk completely lacks
respect for his superiors.

37
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,417
I'm also lacking something today.

38
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,085
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,337
Today is Wednesday.

40
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,464
And my yellow panties got stolen.

41
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,717
So I'm going command…

42
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,181
-What's the cause of death?
-A meth overdose.

43
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,350
She worked as a high-end escort
until recently

44
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,394
but stopped showing up for work
a month ago.

45
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,480
Does she have a butterfly tattoo
on her arm near the track marks?

46
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,526
This is Baek's doing.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,987
He got rid of her when she lost her value.

48
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,532
Then he must be looking for
her replacement somewhere.

49
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:23,244
Most gangsters these days
try to evolve with the times,

50
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,914
but this punk
still uses such primitive methods.

51
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,958
Insufficient evidence again?

52
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,376
What's the point of evidence?

53
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,379
Any evidence tied to Baek isn't accepted.

54
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,634
I bet the bastard has something
on the prosecutors.

55
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,054
Any case related to him is dismissed
due to insufficient evidence.

56
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,848
I don't even know
what they want us to do anymore.

57
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,101
Still, you can't just sit by
when people are dying.

58
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,605
We may be detectives,
but we still live on salaries.

59
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,815
What if digging into this
ends up biting us in the ass?

60
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,821
Just hurry back
and investigate this yourself.

61
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,490
I wish I could do that too.

62
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,035
Baek's been strutting around like a king
since you were sent off to Mujin.

63
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,120
What about Seung-gil?
Have you located him?

64
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,122
No, he's completely off the radar.

65
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,500
Even an eraser leaves traces behind,

66
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,418
but there's no sign of him.

67
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,088
-Auntie.
-Yes?

68
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,465
Why aren't there any patients today?

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,592
You have to visit Gwang-sik's farm today.

70
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,219
Again? Why?

71
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,055
I said I'm not treating cows anymore
since we're making enough.

72
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,268
Gwang-sik has been our regular
even when things were hard for us.

73
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,271
We can't just turn our back on him
just because we're doing well.

74
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,397
We should help him out.

75
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,023
And the ride?

76
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,484
He's busy today, so he can't pick you up.

77
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,027
Then how am I supposed to get there?

78
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,279
Take the bus.

79
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,198
I'll have to walk for so long.

80
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,039
Where are you going, Bong?

81
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,791
I'm going on a house call, why?

82
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,959
Where is it?

83
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,919
At Gwang-sik's farm.

84
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,089
Get in. I'm going in the same direction.

85
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,259
This isn't like you.
You're usually so cold-hearted.

86
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,761
Get in. I'm not going to offer twice.

87
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,596
I was about to get in.

88
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,233
Ok-hui.

89
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,528
Some rock offered me a ride
so I'm in his car, but only for a bit.

90
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,155
Please don't get me wrong.

91
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,455
Are you more of a left brain type?

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,417
You don't know, do you?

93
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,670
I think you definitely are
a left brain type.

94
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,255
You have no empathy.

95
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,716
You don't try to
understand people or their emotions.

96
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,884
And most importantly,

97
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,053
left brain types
tend to have psychopathic tendencies.

98
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,889
And since I'm a right brain type,
we don't get along.

99
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,308
I never wanted to get along with you.

100
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,855
I haven't been getting enough sleep
because of you.

101
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,399
I need a nap.

102
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,901
Wake me up when we get there.

103
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,368
What's that?

104
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,454
Is that the bank?

105
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,374
What the…

106
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,251
Isn't that the Lotte World Tower?

107
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,838
What's going on?

108
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,131
Are we in Seoul?

109
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,093
You were supposed to
drop me off on the way.

110
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:26,636
It was on the way.

111
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,180
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,684
You've pretty much abducted me.

113
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,228
How could you be so selfish?

114
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,146
I really have to go to Gwang-sik's farm!

115
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,524
He's been our regular
through thick and thin.

116
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,484
You and all your talking!

117
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,657
It's so pretty.

118
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,661
I guess stuff in Seoul
really is on a different level.

119
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,413
So pretty.

120
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,832
What are you doing?

121
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,293
I didn't bring my wallet with me.
Can you lend me some money?

122
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,303
What are we here for?

123
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,933
A guy who looks like a total asshole
is going to get out of that car.

124
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,018
You have to touch his butt

125
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,605
and find out what he's been up to
and what he's planning to do.

126
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,901
Is he getting out?

127
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,198
That's him. Let's go, Bong Bong.

128
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,828
Do you think I'm some kind of bongo
that you can play anytime?

129
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,206
You can't just drag me to Seoul
to work for you.

130
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,042
You want to see
how a left brain type works?

131
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,377
My psychopathic side?

132
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,046
We really don't get along.

133
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,342
Hey, Baek!

134
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,223
Touch me and you're dead.

135
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:58,769
How have you been?

136
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,563
Did you miss me?

137
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,732
I missed you so much too.

138
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,777
How have things been while I was away?

139
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,988
You're going inside?

140
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,451
Sir, you have some gum on your…

141
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,913
She says he has gum on him.

142
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,225
What did you see?

143
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:40,144
He's bought
a lot of fishing boats recently.

144
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:41,979
Really?

145
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,565
But…

146
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,275
what do I do now?

147
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,487
How much did you want to borrow?

148
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,447
128,000 won.

149
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,744
I'm leaving you here if you take too long.

150
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,710
Get out of her way.

151
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,628
Go.

152
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,424
Stay!

153
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,759
No, you can go.

154
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:15,471
Don't.

155
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,476
No.

156
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,155
New lights?

157
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,534
What are you doing?

158
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,743
Are you studying?

159
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,538
Or are you drawing up
some recruitment plans?

160
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,292
Well…

161
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,044
What brings you here, Detective Moon?

162
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,338
Weren't you sent to Mujin?

163
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,595
Isn't the air so nice there?

164
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,890
I've been breathing in
all that nice air thanks to you.

165
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,393
Come on, you shouldn't be thanking me.

166
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,229
It's all thanks to your hard work.

167
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,773
Like getting stabbed in the back
by a gangster.

168
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,360
You're humble as always.

169
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,614
Let's see.

170
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,742
I saw your latest masterpiece.

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,751
Why make the girls get butterfly tattoos
when you don't have one?

172
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,669
What are you, Papillon?

173
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,965
So you showed up here after all this time
just to spout nonsense to me?

174
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,553
Do you serve fish at your bar?

175
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,556
Why else would you buy
so many fishing boats?

176
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,603
But you're not actually catching any fish,

177
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,647
since there's no record of you
in the fish markets.

178
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,109
So what are you up to?

179
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,320
Smuggling drugs?

180
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,702
You also seem very well-connected.

181
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,997
I see you've been pulling some strings.

182
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,960
Stop being so clueless

183
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,420
and just, you know.

184
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,005
I'll be back in no time, all right?

185
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,410
Moon Jang-yeol…

186
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,955
was here.

187
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,208
Did you see him?

188
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,001
Yes.

189
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:53,921
I think…

190
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,550
we better kill him.

191
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,698
Did you see anything else
other than the fishing boats?

192
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,658
Like what?

193
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,869
Like the guy you saw

194
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,205
when you touched my butt a while back.

195
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,082
That guy?

196
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,419
I only touched him for a second,
so the boats were all I saw.

197
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:40,384
But what happened
between you and that guy?

198
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,928
That's none of your business.

199
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,982
I could drop you off at your place.

200
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,110
I can't have rumors spreading
about how I was riding your car.

201
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,071
It'd be terrible if someone saw us
in this tiny town.

202
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,073
Like who? The convenience store guy?

203
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,535
I didn't mean anyone specifically.

204
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,789
I'm kind of a celebrity in Mujin.

205
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,125
Right, Ms. Celebrity.

206
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,961
You better pay me back
my 128,000 won by tomorrow.

207
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,090
That ungrateful little…

208
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,570
Are you just getting back?

209
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322
Ok-hui.

210
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,034
Some rock that I'd never seen before

211
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,912
dragged me to Seoul
because he had to investigate something.

212
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,455
What a crazy little…

213
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,710
So that's what happened.

214
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,381
I haven't seen this outfit before.

215
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,383
Right.

216
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,635
You haven't.

217
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,805
So what happened is…

218
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,849
I spotted this beautiful dress in Seoul.

219
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,437
So I borrowed 128,000 won from that rock,

220
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,857
promising to pay him back tomorrow.

221
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,778
128,000 won?

222
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,574
-So he basically bought it for you.
-Why are you…

223
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,158
Are you going to rip my new dress?

224
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,160
I can't rip you instead, can I?

225
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,750
Ye-bun.

226
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,088
No more exchanges of any sort.

227
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,633
You're smart,
so I trust you get what I mean.

228
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,219
Get home.

229
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,223
Try to avoid your aunt if you can.

230
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,766
Why?

231
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,560
You little brat!

232
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,022
Where have you been all day
instead of making the house call?

233
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,607
Hurry over to Gwang-sik's farm!

234
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,905
The calf is really weak,
which is why it's been having diarrhea.

235
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,823
I gave it some shots,

236
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,284
so it'll get better soon
if it stays with its mother.

237
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,953
Thank you so much, Dr. Bong.

238
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,669
Being here with you like this
reminds me of that night.

239
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,255
Me too.

240
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,051
It's been so exhausting.

241
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,969
Why did I have to get a power like this?

242
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,887
What?

243
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,847
Why would you say it's exhausting?

244
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,890
It's a blessing.

245
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,808
How is this a blessing?

246
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,686
You just haven't been using it properly.

247
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,481
This power is amazingly useful
when it comes to dating.

248
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,233
Touching a person shows us everything.

249
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,361
Since we can learn anything about anyone,

250
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,655
there's no heart we can't win.

251
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,743
Don't you have anyone
you'd like to ask out?

252
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,373
Not really.

253
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,000
If you think about it,

254
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,503
we might not have this power forever.

255
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:06,006
It can be gone
just as suddenly as it came to us.

256
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,762
So don't hesitate
to make the most of it while you can.

257
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,723
Sir.

258
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,392
If you don't mind,

259
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,436
may I have a look?

260
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,479
All right.

261
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,455
How do you understand me so well?

262
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,541
-Go out with me.
-I like you so much.

263
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,126
-Let's go on a date.
-I adore you.

264
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,169
-I feel like we're soulmates.
-Are you okay?

265
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,671
-Go out with me.
-Are you hurt?

266
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,717
Thank you.

267
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,553
Dr. Bong,

268
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,139
don't let your power go to waste.

269
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,348
Make the most of it.

270
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,521
Here's some raw milk.

271
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,440
Make sure to heat it up

272
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,941
-before you drink it.
-Okay.

273
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,735
Or else you might get a stomachache.

274
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,487
I'll do that. Thank you.

275
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,864
Wait.

276
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,365
Come with me to the car.

277
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
I'll drive you into town.

278
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
You really don't have to.

279
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,995
-I insist.
-Thank you.

280
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,503
What are you doing?

281
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,299
Shamans need to be fit.

282
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,761
I ran here backward from my house.

283
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,982
You're exercising?

284
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:47,941
You know,

285
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,319
this is the age of MeTube.

286
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,530
Different shamans
have different themes for their channels.

287
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,617
Some do mukbangs,
some sing, some play video games,

288
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,826
and some assemble furniture.

289
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,496
I'm thinking of branding myself
as the buff shaman.

290
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,957
What a nice idea.

291
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,880
Dr. Bong.

292
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,591
What brings you here?

293
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,051
Did you come to buy something?

294
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,553
Someone gave me some raw milk.

295
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,555
So I came to give some to you.

296
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,642
-Thank you.
-Sure.

297
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,483
This power is amazingly useful
when it comes to dating.

298
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
I've done a lot of good things
for the world.

299
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,114
Why not use my power for myself for once?

300
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,915
Thank you, God.

301
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,431
I'm beat.

302
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,605
Can I drink this?

303
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,606
What?

304
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,024
But that's…

305
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,235
Yes, sure.

306
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,236
Go ahead.

307
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,823
I'll bring you some more another time.

308
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,621
What a shame.

309
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,127
My stomach!

310
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,005
Oh, right.

311
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,007
You're supposed to heat it up
before you drink it.

312
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,135
Where's the bathroom?

313
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,052
It's this way.

314
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,055
No!

315
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,891
Not yet!

316
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,727
Serves you right,
you clueless fake shaman.

317
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,036
All right.

318
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,003
My Friday panties…

319
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,340
There.

320
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,383
Saturday.

321
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,426
Sunday.

322
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,387
Where did Friday go?

323
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,894
We have a case!

324
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
-Let's go!
-What kind of case is it?

325
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,856
There's been a series of disappearances.

326
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,899
-Hurry!
-What?

327
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,116
Is this what you meant
by a series of disappearances?

328
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,745
People's underwear have disappeared
for two days in a row.

329
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,999
That would make this
a series of disappearances.

330
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,377
This is the scene of the crime, okay?

331
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,463
I hung up my Friday panties here,

332
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,091
and they vanished into thin air!

333
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,843
Hang on.

334
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,637
My Saturday and Sunday panties
are also gone.

335
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,681
Someone must have stolen them too!

336
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,307
I've already lost three!

337
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,225
What in the world?

338
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,978
What kind of pervert is doing this?

339
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,064
So for the rest of the week,

340
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,148
I'll be going comman…

341
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,945
Everyone, calm down.

342
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,656
Just trust me.

343
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:26,201
I'll make sure to put
this sick bastard behind bars.

344
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,911
My goodness!

345
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,497
-Of course, Captain.
-What a relief.

346
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,750
-Thank you.
-We're good now.

347
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,628
Any security cameras or dash cams?

348
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,671
None, sir.

349
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,631
-Any witnesses?
-None, sir.

350
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,591
This investigation is going to be tricky.

351
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,718
I know.

352
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,137
We're pulling all-nighters from today.

353
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,431
Sorry?

354
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,808
A stakeout is the only way
to catch such a bastard.

355
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,520
We're not going home until we catch him.

356
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,315
A stakeout for some underwear thief
is too much.

357
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,774
Listen, punk.

358
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,110
Have you ever been without your underwear?

359
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,987
It makes you feel

360
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,282
empty, irritated, ashamed,
and uncomfortable all day.

361
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,284
We'd be neglecting our duties

362
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,745
if we turned away
from citizens in discomfort.

363
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,331
And do you only care about cases
that will send you back to Seoul?

364
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,042
Do the other cases mean nothing to you?

365
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,640
The thief is bound to show up here.

366
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,976
Captain,

367
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,353
investigations shouldn't be
based on hunches.

368
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,688
Have you not heard of forensics?

369
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,483
You need scientific evidence.

370
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,902
The culprit's not going to show up

371
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,737
just because you stake out
in random places.

372
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,822
No cops rely on their hunches anymore.

373
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,741
I chose this place based on evidence.

374
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,534
What evidence?

375
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,286
That family only has daughters.

376
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,956
Their grandmother even collapsed
from frustration when they were born.

377
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,375
You still think it's a hunch?

378
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,003
Yes, that's exactly what a hunch is.

379
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,838
Get down.

380
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,886
That bastard is at it again.

381
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,804
Stop!

382
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,764
Don't mess this up
when we've almost got it.

383
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,723
Stay where you are.

384
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,266
He's here!

385
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,601
He's here.

386
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,026
Let's go!

387
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,319
Open the door!

388
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,740
Catch him!

389
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,494
Are you okay, Captain?

390
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,787
Go get him.

391
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,543
Stop, you bastard!

392
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,890
What the hell?

393
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,101
Where did that bastard go?

394
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,773
What the…

395
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,497
What kind of detective
gets whacked in the head by a thief?

396
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,623
Can you believe it?

397
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,334
You're one to talk.
You were the first one to go down.

398
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,254
Hey, that was because he was so fast.

399
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,716
I bet he was faster than Usain Bolt.

400
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,177
But if he's that fast,
he could've just run away.

401
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,345
Why did he have to hit Detective Moon?

402
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,390
It's because he looks down on us.

403
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,059
"No matter what you guys do,
you can't catch me."

404
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,477
"Catch me if you can."

405
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,687
That's it.

406
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,813
Don't you think?

407
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,233
Anyway, let's call it a day

408
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,569
-and strategize again tomorrow--
-Says who?

409
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,447
No one's going home until we catch him.

410
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,616
We're doing another stakeout right away.

411
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,533
Got it?

412
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,287
Answer me! Got it?

413
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,872
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

414
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,796
Why did I say, "Yes, sir"?

415
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,905
Let's split up
and cover different areas this time.

416
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,783
We'll never catch him
if we chase him all at once like before.

417
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,411
Detective Bae,
position yourself under the wall.

418
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,080
Detective Na, you follow on a scooter.

419
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,414
And you…

420
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,876
I'm the captain here.

421
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,796
My mistake. Please understand.

422
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,633
I want to understand,
but it didn't seem like a mistake.

423
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
It was a mistake.

424
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,929
Captain, you block the exit
from the end of the alley.

425
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,848
But why do you keep giving orders?

426
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,768
Why is that important?
Catching the thief is what matters now.

427
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,436
It's important to me.

428
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,982
Come on, let's get moving. Go!

429
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,696
I'll get into position for now,

430
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,656
but this is wrong.

431
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,550
Thief!

432
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,046
What the hell?

433
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,299
Damn it.

434
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,110
COMPETENT AND CONFIDENT POLICE
SAFE AND RELIABLE COMMUNITY

435
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,824
So you got hit with a bowl this time?

436
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,119
It was a dog bowl. Get your facts right.

437
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,831
What did I tell you?

438
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,042
You shouldn't underestimate the guy.

439
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,338
Where are you going?

440
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,256
I'm going home to change my underwear.

441
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,926
You can't. We have to catch the culprit.

442
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,596
You two send me a list of ex-cons
with the same MO.

443
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,557
You get the car ready
for tonight's stakeout.

444
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,767
Then go to the community office

445
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,853
and compile a list of families
who have women in their houses.

446
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,399
We're not going home until we catch him.

447
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,525
Wait.

448
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,984
What?

449
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,779
That's a bit too much for me.

450
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,447
Don't you want to catch him?

451
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,324
I do.

452
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,493
Are you going to make
the citizens go without underwear?

453
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,120
No.

454
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,290
But still, I'm the captain here.

455
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,543
Getting the car ready isn't my job.

456
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,171
Then Detective Bae can take care of that.

457
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,006
You come with me to question people.

458
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,301
You tenacious bastard.

459
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,472
Hey.

460
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,434
I'll ask the higher-ups
to install security cameras

461
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,852
all over the place here.

462
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,228
So let's use those.

463
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,479
That's going to take forever.

464
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,940
Do you know what my nickname is?

465
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,567
Mad Dog.

466
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,152
Once I bite, I never let go.

467
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm getting him no matter what.

468
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,156
I think I'm the one who got bitten here.

469
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,574
Just my luck.

470
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,664
For crying out loud.

471
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,793
What do I do with this?

472
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,172
Damn it.

473
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,551
Who are you?

474
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,845
What do you think?

475
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,139
We're detectives going after
the underwear thief.

476
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,557
Who are you calling an underwear thief?

477
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,769
You should know since you're the one
wearing women's panties.

478
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,895
What are you talking about?

479
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,106
I never stole any underwear.

480
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:36,941
Really?

481
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,985
Then run away.

482
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,737
What?

483
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,363
Run.

484
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,698
What do you…

485
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,783
Run!

486
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,368
Come on. What if we lose him?

487
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,212
All right. Stop.

488
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,881
I'm telling you it's not me.

489
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,219
He can't run as fast as him.

490
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,723
Then why are you wearing women's panties?

491
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,684
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

492
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,230
That never stops people from talking.

493
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,525
Someone gave them to me.

494
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,526
Who?

495
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,619
Was this from you?

496
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,205
Yes.

497
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,458
Why would you hand out women's underwear?

498
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,337
His yang energy was so strong

499
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,048
that it had to be brought down
by the yin energy.

500
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,259
Where did you get the underwear?

501
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,510
He said they weren't new.

502
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,266
Why aren't you answering?

503
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,600
Did you steal them or something?

504
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,231
They were…

505
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,025
worn by me.

506
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,281
Where in the world would I get
used women's underwear?

507
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,908
I guess I was blinded by money.

508
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,661
My living depends on my shaman work.

509
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,665
Of course.

510
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,877
My living depends on my detective work.

511
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,671
So I understand where you're coming from
better than anyone.

512
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,594
May I take a look around
to verify your statement?

513
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,988
Look.

514
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,907
What did I tell you?

515
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,409
He's not that kind of guy.

516
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,785
You shouldn't suspect him

517
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,538
just because he's alone here
with a family to support abroad.

518
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,542
He's still our prime suspect,
so let's keep an eye on him.

519
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,881
-What's that sound?
-Attention, please.

520
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,052
I have an urgent announcement.

521
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:13,389
Recently, a perverted thief

522
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,101
has been going around the neighborhood,
stealing women's underwear.

523
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,020
So I ask all residents

524
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,856
to take all their underwear from outside

525
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,693
and dry them indoors.

526
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,364
Then was my underwear stolen as well?

527
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,950
A police investigation is underway,

528
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,328
but they haven't made much progress.

529
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,207
They say the thief can run extremely fast.

530
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,003
Detective Moon Jang-yeol from Seoul
chased the thief with everything he had

531
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,131
but didn't even manage
to catch up to his shadow.

532
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,926
He even got hit not once but twice

533
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,222
in the noggin… I mean, head.

534
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,100
The thief's weapon of choice
was a dog bowl.

535
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,019
So don't leave any dog bowls outside.

536
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,898
If any of you run into
Detective Moon Jang-yeol,

537
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,234
make sure to give him your heartfelt words

538
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,613
of comfort and encouragement.

539
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,283
Detective Moon.

540
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,493
Is your head okay?

541
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,288
I bet it hurts.

542
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,499
It's not like his head is a bowling ball.

543
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,044
Where are you going?

544
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,421
Why are you running away?

545
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,422
Off to go bowling?

546
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,215
Don't tease him like that.

547
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,050
He did what he could.

548
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,846
Hey, Jang-yeol!

549
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,476
That nutjob must be really embarrassed.

550
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,436
Ye-bun,

551
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,147
my undies must've been stolen.
What do I do?

552
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,441
Let the police handle it.

553
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,692
That's the issue here!

554
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,486
I'll be so embarrassed if they find them!

555
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,822
What about yours?

556
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:53,740
Mine are fine.

557
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,954
What is it? Are your undies missing too?

558
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,414
Hey!

559
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,292
You heard the announcement?

560
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,418
Yes.

561
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,842
What kind of style are you looking for?

562
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,844
-Something not embarrassing when stolen.
-Sorry?

563
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,472
Something that won't be humiliating
even when found by the police.

564
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,807
Something that stands out.

565
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,732
I feel so relieved now.

566
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,985
I know. Imagine if ours got stolen.
It would've been so humiliating.

567
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,112
Let's burn all our
current worn-out underwear.

568
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,489
Sounds good.

569
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,957
Have you eaten?

570
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,376
Do you think I have an appetite right now?

571
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,755
He must be too busy to even eat.

572
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,507
His face looks so gaunt.

573
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,884
The poor thing.

574
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,054
This won't do.

575
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,555
I should catch the thief.

576
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,307
So he's fast?

577
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,318
Where's Da-eun's brother?

578
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,862
He said he had to grade
midterm exam papers today.

579
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:17,949
Okay, girls.

580
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,700
Here's what this is about.

581
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,161
I'm sure you've heard about
the perv in our town.

582
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,163
I need you to catch him with me today.

583
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,373
-Yes, sis!
-Yes, sis!

584
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,501
They say the bastard is too fast to catch.

585
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,045
That's why I need some fast runners today.

586
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,964
-Are any of you fast runners?
-Yes, sis.

587
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,591
I had to run fast
to skip self-study sessions.

588
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,553
I had to run fast
so my dyed hair wouldn't get cut!

589
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,889
I had to run fast
so that I wouldn't get caught smoking!

590
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,558
I'll just run as fast as I can!

591
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,601
Then show me what you've got.

592
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,811
Ready.

593
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,821
Don't you have midterms to grade?

594
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,364
You come before midterms, sis.

595
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,283
Too bad. The race has already started.

596
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,952
May I still participate, sis?

597
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:03,870
-Sure.
-Okay.

598
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,262
You're really fast.

599
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,930
I'm the head of discipline.

600
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,849
I run after students who skip classes,

601
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,142
smoke cigarettes,

602
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,685
and dye their hair.

603
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,936
So I had to get faster.

604
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,731
The future of education
looks bright thanks to you.

605
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,149
Thank you, sis.

606
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,484
Education is the cornerstone
of the future, sis.

607
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,498
Have you seen anyone suspicious lately?

608
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
Suspicious?

609
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,044
What do you mean?

610
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,921
Anyone who seems off

611
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,881
or people you haven't seen around before.

612
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,217
Outsiders like you.

613
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,182
There is an outsider
who recently came to town.

614
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,516
Who?

615
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,268
You.

616
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,569
What are you doing?

617
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,156
What do you think?
I came to buy something.

618
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,036
Hello.

619
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,141
You have something on you.

620
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,063
Were you going to brush it off him?

621
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,024
-Yes.
-I see.

622
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,567
But what's with the gum?

623
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,115
-You son of a…
-That's how you chew gum?

624
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,951
You spit it out, pop it back in,
then chew it again…

625
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,327
Bye.

626
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,416
MEETING IN SESSION

627
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,084
What is this all about?

628
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,962
I need your help with an investigation.

629
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,422
What is it this time?

630
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,007
The underwear thief.

631
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,591
What about him?

632
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,968
You didn't catch him yet.

633
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,095
Unless you bring him in, I can't do--

634
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,221
Touch me.

635
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,140
What?

636
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,725
Your power has improved a lot.

637
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,602
Maybe you'll see something I missed.

638
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,438
So…

639
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
touch me.

640
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,444
Are you being serious?

641
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,280
That's how desperate I am.

642
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,574
Here. Touch me.

643
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,036
Are you sure about this?

644
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,830
Yes, go ahead and touch me.

645
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,333
Wait, but…

646
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,292
But what?

647
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,295
Only look at things relevant to the thief.

648
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,380
I'll try.

649
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,106
Jang-yeol, it's been so long.

650
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,649
Hello, Sister.

651
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,068
You look even better.

652
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,819
What? The police station?

653
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,697
Tell me what happened, you punks.

654
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,615
Seung-gil!

655
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,411
He's here for underage drinking,
assault, and illegal gambling.

656
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,040
I'm a minor! Hurry up and let me go!

657
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,501
Answer me. Do you have money or not?

658
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,752
Hey, Seung-gil.

659
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,172
Damn it.

660
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,799
Let's just go.

661
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,137
What is this?

662
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,305
It's your birthday.

663
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,516
It's still two years
before you come of age.

664
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,851
I won't get many points
by arresting you now.

665
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,896
So I'm going to arrest you
once you come of age.

666
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,315
I'd like to celebrate
that day drawing nearer.

667
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,946
One more year to go.

668
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,240
But why aren't you
getting in trouble lately?

669
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,575
I want to be rewarded
for waiting all these years.

670
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,536
Blow out the candles. They're melting.

671
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,251
Come on.

672
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,086
A cake with handcuffs?

673
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,671
You're no longer a minor.

674
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,132
The next time you meet me,
you'll be in cuffs.

675
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,091
You can't catch me.

676
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,801
I can catch anyone.

677
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,177
Blow out the candles.

678
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,220
Where's my song?

679
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,139
I'm not here to celebrate.

680
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,849
-Come on, sing.
-No, you punk.

681
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,059
Then I'm going to
let someone else arrest me.

682
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,144
Then sing with me.

683
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,438
-Happy birthday to you…
-Happy birthday to you…

684
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,400
Behave.

685
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,902
That punk.

686
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,428
What are you doing here?

687
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,429
Jang-yeol…

688
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,148
What did you see?

689
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,442
I didn't see enough. Let me look again.

690
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,402
You…

691
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,238
I told you not to look at anything else.

692
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,254
It's too small for me to see.

693
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,299
What are you doing?

694
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,510
Just wait. I'm trying to zoom in.

695
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,097
It's working.

696
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,437
I know this person.

697
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,606
-What?
-He came to my hospital before.

698
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,567
Right!

699
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,985
That dog bowl!

700
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,612
I'm the one who sold it to him.

701
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,907
Merry!

702
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,287
-Is this where he lives?
-Yes.

703
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,544
What are you doing?

704
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,172
I'm going to catch this bastard.

705
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,082
-Good evening, Detective.
-Why are you here?

706
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,792
No one's faster
than the head of discipline!

707
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,751
Stop right there!

708
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,213
I'll go this way and cut him off!

709
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,149
You're hurting me.

710
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,405
I caught him, sis.

711
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,718
Seung-gil, what are you doing here?

712
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,143
I'm a minor!

713
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,519
Hurry up and let me go!

714
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,898
Jang-yeol…

715
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,542
Detective Moon!

716
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,252
Detective Moon!

717
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,922
Detective! Are you okay?

718
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:35,881
What do I do?

719
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,758
Let me see. What do I do?

720
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,595
That Seung-gil or whoever it is
stabbed you, didn't he?

721
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,472
Hang on. Let me call the police.

722
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,308
Don't.

723
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,102
Why not?

724
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:52,815
Detective Moon.

725
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,858
Detective Moon!

726
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,070
Help!

727
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,905
Stay with me, Detective Moon.

728
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,032
Help!

729
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,628
Dr. Bong!

730
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,050
Captain Won.

731
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,344
What in the world happened?

732
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,513
He just went into emergency surgery.

733
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:25,639
Who on earth did this?

734
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,932
Did you see anything?

735
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,114
MUJIN MEDICAL CENTER

736
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,661
Fortunately, he'll be fine.

737
00:45:47,744 --> 00:45:51,498
You two check all the security cameras
and dash cam footage

738
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,791
from where he got stabbed.

739
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,709
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

740
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,878
What about the underwear thief?

741
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
I'll interrogate him.

742
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,507
You two go after the bastard
who stabbed Detective Moon.

743
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,550
Understood, sir.

744
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,844
You didn't tell anyone, right?

745
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,387
For now.

746
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,973
But why shouldn't I tell anyone?

747
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,934
Mind your own business.

748
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,729
How could he stab you

749
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,731
when you were so good to him?

750
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,232
You broke your promise.

751
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,068
Everything else was off-limits.

752
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,820
I couldn't help it.

753
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,035
What are you doing? You need more rest.

754
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,579
I can take care of myself.

755
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,414
So go. I want to rest.

756
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,041
You're unbelievable.

757
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,511
Run

758
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,722
Run, Hany

759
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,182
Hany

760
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,017
To the end of the world

761
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,894
The world

762
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,063
-Run, Hany
-Run, Hany

763
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,398
Hany

764
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:00,901
You should feel honored.

765
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,321
She hasn't sung this
since she tore her knee ligament way back.

766
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,406
Hey.

767
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,826
Take her with you when you leave.

768
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,294
Hello. Hi, Seon-woo.

769
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,379
Hello.

770
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,633
What are you…

771
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,890
Are you okay?

772
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,850
Yes, well…

773
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,691
It looks like you were stabbed
near your spleen.

774
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,111
I guess the knife missed it, thankfully.

775
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,072
You seem to know
a lot about human anatomy.

776
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,910
Just things I've picked up
from here and there.

777
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,290
I didn't want to come empty-handed.

778
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,374
There's no need.

779
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,468
That one's for a speedy recovery.

780
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,764
And that one's good for men.

781
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:14,933
I see.

782
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,602
You didn't have to visit me.

783
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,022
Your neighbors are here.

784
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:20,981
Come in.

785
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,066
How are you doing?

786
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,527
-Are you hurt badly?
-Are you okay?

787
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,987
What is going on here?

788
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,617
Hospital visits are just as important
as attending weddings and funerals here.

789
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,328
-Why?
-Since no one knows what may happen.

790
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,121
They want to see you before you die.

791
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,582
Listen up, everyone.

792
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,168
His injuries are not
life-threatening at all.

793
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,961
He's fine.

794
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,339
That's good news.

795
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,049
I burned the roof of my mouth

796
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,134
so I wouldn't have been
able to eat the funeral food.

797
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,595
He's so happy that you survived

798
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,014
-that he wants to cry.
-Thank you.

799
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,932
I saved my kids' tuition.

800
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,768
He says he'll pay
a lot of condolence money

801
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,852
when you actually die.

802
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,606
Didn't Yeong-beom's old man
also say he was fine,

803
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,232
then just suddenly drop dead?

804
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,028
He says you should stay vigilant
and take care of yourself.

805
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,656
I was so worried on my way here

806
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,575
that my mouth is all parched.

807
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,869
He's asking
if he can have one of these drinks.

808
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,037
Sure.

809
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,247
Give them here.

810
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,918
Everyone take one. Drink.

811
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,378
Gwang-sik,

812
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,506
you don't even know
Detective Moon personally.

813
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,549
I've seen him around a couple of times.

814
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,718
Is that right?

815
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,179
Then it's good you came.

816
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,642
This hospital is so nice.

817
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,726
He'll be back tomorrow.

818
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,395
What…

819
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,023
-Those polka dots are mine.
-Those over there.

820
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,566
-Saturday, Sunday…
-They're mine!

821
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,195
-That perverted bastard.
-I can't believe this.

822
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,155
My goodness.

823
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,575
Where did you steal
those leopard-print panties from?

824
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,829
The house with the persimmon tree.
Eun-sil's house.

825
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,831
And these polka-dot ones?

826
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,917
The family that runs the rice cake store.
Ji-yeong's place.

827
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,005
You sick bastard.

828
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,216
You stole panties from the elders too?

829
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,427
You really don't discriminate, do you?

830
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,554
Where did you steal those from?

831
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,055
That's from Bong's--

832
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,890
Die!

833
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,475
Die, you bastard!

834
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,727
-You deserve to die!
-What…

835
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,979
-Die!
-Calm down.

836
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,231
-All right.
-Don't get worked up.

837
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,274
What were you saying?

838
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,401
-Bong's--
-Die!

839
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:30,944
Die!

840
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,571
-Die, you piece of crap!
-You…

841
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,240
How dare you steal panties from an elder?

842
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,742
You sick bastard!

843
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,663
I almost got caught.

844
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,900
Hyeon-ok!

845
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,855
Take this with you.

846
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,359
What is it?

847
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,117
I didn't mean to look at them.

848
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,245
But when you were 21,

849
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,372
you only liked pretty things.

850
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,897
Whenever I see you,

851
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,526
I want to be 21 again, Jong-muk.

852
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,342
Look at me, bringing comic books
for that thankless jerk.

853
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,231
Ye-bun.

854
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,733
Mr. Cha.

855
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,984
What are you doing here?

856
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:19,696
I heard Detective Moon was hospitalized
and thought I should stop by.

857
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,116
I'm here to see him too.
Let's go together.

858
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:25,368
How have you been?

859
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,245
-Who do we have here?
-Look who's here.

860
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,247
-Hello.
-Hello.

861
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,498
Hello, everyone.

862
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:31,583
Hello.

863
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,630
I don't think we've met.

864
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,090
No, we haven't.

865
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:42,302
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Hello.

866
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:45,972
The whole neighborhood has gathered today.

867
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,976
May I take this opportunity
to ask for your vote?

868
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,478
-Of course.
-Yes.

869
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,063
Thank you.

870
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,649
This way, sir. I can take you there.

871
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,317
Thank you. Well then.

872
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,944
-See you.
-Goodbye.

873
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,155
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

874
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,492
Second floor.

875
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,619
Going up.

876
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,625
The doors are closing.

877
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,424
Detective Moon is this way.

878
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,699
NUTJOB

879
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,579
CAPTAIN WON JONG-MUK

880
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,292
Dr. Bong?

881
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,587
Captain, the guy who stabbed
Detective Moon is here.

882
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,755
What?

883
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,173
You said you didn't see who did it.

884
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,218
I'll explain everything later,
so please come to the hospital.

885
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,012
I'm right out front.

886
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,806
Stay away. It's dangerous.

887
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,571
He's going down the stairs right now.

888
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,448
Please hurry. He's running away.

889
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,409
Yes, I'm following him.

890
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,415
But I think…

891
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,793
I've just been caught.

892
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,299
Who are you?

893
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,717
Why are you following me?

894
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,137
You're the one…

895
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,556
who stabbed Detective Moon, right?

896
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,892
How do you know that?

897
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,519
Is he alive?

898
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,149
Why did you come here?

899
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,734
I asked if he was alive!

900
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:04,944
How hurt is he?

901
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,323
You want to know how hurt he is

902
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,784
instead of whether he's dead or not?

903
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,452
Why?

904
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,873
Don't tell me you're worried about him
after stabbing him yourself.

905
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,714
Why did you do it?

906
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,133
You two were close.

907
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,178
He trusted you.

908
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,818
Who are you?

909
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,530
We're Detective Moon's friends.

910
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,117
I know you need money
with the surgery and everything.

911
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,243
I have a job for you.

912
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,244
I don't need one.

913
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,955
Is that the nun?

914
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,957
I heard the surgery went well.

915
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,669
But she might not make it past tonight.

916
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,549
I'll pay you handsomely.

917
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,385
We even provide comprehensive
employee insurance too.

918
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,389
Hey, Byeong-ho.

919
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,351
I have a hundred mouths to feed.

920
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:21,729
If we don't get rid of him,
all 100 of them would starve to death.

921
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,233
So what should we do?

922
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,527
I'll get rid of him.

923
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:29,446
You will?

924
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:32,157
Moon Jang-yeol ended up here
because of me.

925
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,867
Shouldn't I wrap things up?

926
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,953
You have a point.

927
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,917
Jang-yeol, what's that scar
on your stomach?

928
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:43,960
This?

929
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,045
A bastard named Baek stabbed me.

930
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,673
I got my spleen removed back then,

931
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,550
so I won't die
if I get stabbed here again.

932
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,759
Isn't that cool?

933
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,476
Seung-gil, what are you doing here?

934
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,774
You didn't stab him to kill him,

935
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,318
but to save him?

936
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,320
Who are you?

937
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,323
You knew he wouldn't die
if you stabbed him there.

938
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:17,452
Detective Moon knew it was you,
but he told me not to report it.

939
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,165
Let's go.

940
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,334
He'll understand all of this…

941
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,464
Shut it. What do you know?

942
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,509
Dr. Bong!

943
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,261
Dr. Bong!

944
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,016
Dr. Bong, there you are.

945
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,895
Are you okay?

946
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,647
-Yes.
-Where's the culprit?

947
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,652
Who was it? Why won't you say anything?

948
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,654
I…

949
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,113
I'm sorry.

950
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,823
I was mistaken.

951
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,992
What?

952
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,619
I mean,

953
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,746
how could you mistake something like that?

954
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,373
I'm out of breath.

955
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:05,917
Okay.

956
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,129
I guess I have to go
buy some more porridge.

957
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,725
MISSED CALL
BONG YE-BUN

958
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,397
What the…

959
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,609
Why did you call?

960
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,778
I saw that guy.

961
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,407
The guy who stabbed you. Park Seung-gil.

962
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:38,908
What?

963
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,870
He stabbed you to save you.

964
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,540
What are you talking about?

965
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,584
Do you think you're alive
because you were lucky?

966
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:52,505
Think about why he stabbed you
in that very spot.

967
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,020
Jang-yeol,

968
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,814
what's that scar on your stomach?

969
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,358
This?

970
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,110
A bastard named Baek stabbed me.

971
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,487
I got my spleen removed back then,

972
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,531
so I won't die
if I get stabbed here again.

973
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,283
Isn't that cool?

974
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:26,914
He never wanted to betray you.

975
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,583
Baek was threatening him,

976
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,502
and he did it to save the nun.

977
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,505
So?

978
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,007
I'm sorry?

979
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,885
He still betrayed and stabbed me.

980
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,054
Nothing has changed.

981
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,347
He's still a criminal.

982
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,070
He came here

983
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,988
because he was worried about you.

984
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,574
If you don't believe me, ask him.

985
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,992
He'd still be here somewhere.

986
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,285
Forget it!

987
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,871
What is there to talk about
with the bastard who stabbed me?

988
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,298
Seung-gil.

989
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,508
Oh, my gosh.

990
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,802
Seung-gil!

991
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,179
Hang on. I'll call a doctor.

992
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,305
Jang-yeol.

993
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,849
Don't go.

994
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,309
Seung-gil.

995
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,436
I'm sorry.

996
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,105
I…

997
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,649
No, don't talk.
I know what you want to say.

998
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,733
I know everything.

999
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,361
Seung-gil!

1000
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,251
-Happy birthday to you…
-Happy birthday to you…

1001
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,336
Just blow them out.

1002
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,679
What are you doing here?

1003
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,526
Seung-gil!

1004
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,407
Seung-gil!

1005
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:25,867
Stay with me!

1006
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,494
No, Seung-gil!

1007
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,497
Seung-gil!

1008
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:32,999
Seung-gil!

1009
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,751
Seung-gil!

1010
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,678
Seung-gil!

1011
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,839
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

1012
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,257
This bastard killed Seung-gil.

1013
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,134
It wasn't him.
He's not the one who killed him.

1014
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,427
Help me.

1015
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,471
You're all I have right now.

1016
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,181
Would you like a talisman?

1017
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,768
Can it make sure
things don't work out between them?

1018
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:36,062
It'll bring bad luck to whatever they do.

1019
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,397
I need to know
what happened to him here that night.

1020
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,150
Where is a snake's butt located?

1021
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,944
You're the vet. How would I know?

1022
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:46,113
The culprit is definitely
a Mujin resident.

1023
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,240
Looking at it now,
he was wearing a raincoat.

1024
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,616
A raincoat that looks like a cape.

1025
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,617
A rain poncho.

1026
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,744
Don't walk around alone at night.

1027
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,579
Make sure to call me.

1028
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,998
Do you remember anyone
who recently bought a rain poncho?

1029
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:58,918
Seon-woo?

1030
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:08,678
