1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,054
-The person
-The person

3
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,350
-who killed me…
-who killed me…

4
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,145
-is here.
-is here.

5
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,165
-Oh, no!
-Mr. Park!

6
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,417
-Mr. Park.
-Detective Bae,

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,127
-call an ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

8
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,837
-I'll carry him.
-Okay.

9
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,005
Get him on his back.

10
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,217
-Be careful.
-There you go.

11
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,719
Let's go.

12
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,222
Are you okay?

13
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,598
I twisted my ankle.

14
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,849
Hurry up and go!

15
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:41,768
Jong-muk, are you okay?

16
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,186
I'm fine.

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,771
-Let me see.
-What just happened?

18
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,814
I just twisted it.

19
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,315
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

20
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,901
Be careful.

21
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,069
Why did this…

22
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,153
For goodness' sake.

23
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,961
Welcome.

24
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,003
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,297
Give us something cold to drink.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,342
Girls, bring out some iced coffee.

27
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,888
Why are you all so worked up?

28
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,057
Wasn't the village rite today?

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,559
Don't get me started.

30
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,354
The rite was over the minute it started.

31
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,605
Why?

32
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,026
The soul of a dead person
went into the shaman's body.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,487
His eyes were fluttering like this,

34
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,866
and he was saying things like,
"The person who killed me is here."

35
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,701
It was totally, you know…

36
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,536
How scary.

37
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,288
Oh, my goodness!

38
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,915
Pick up the phone!

39
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,921
Mujin Coffee Shop.

40
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,173
-Two cups of coffee to Mujin Realtors?
-I was thinking.

41
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,091
Okay.

42
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,218
How can we believe
everything that shaman says?

43
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,220
But when it was all happening,

44
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,932
I actually got goosebumps
all over my body.

45
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,350
It seemed real.

46
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,519
Come now.

47
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,687
So what if it's real?

48
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,733
Are you saying
that there really is a killer among us?

49
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,156
Enjoy.

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,074
Thank you.

51
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,620
In any case,

52
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,918
I think I'll be too scared
to go around the neighborhood now.

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,129
But we can't just
lock ourselves up at home.

54
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,465
This is bad.

55
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,301
This might completely ruin our village.

56
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,683
MUJIN POLICE STATION

57
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,937
Have you found anything yet?

58
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,189
Not yet.

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,734
How can this be?
There's absolutely no trace left behind.

60
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,363
Maybe the shaman is right
and the killer is a resident here.

61
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,824
Otherwise, how could the killer know
how to avoid all the CCTVs?

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,409
According to my father,

63
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,914
that shaman has occasionally
been right about things in the past.

64
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:13,086
Then should we seriously consider
asking the shaman who the killer is?

65
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,839
I told you countless times
that the killer is from around here

66
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,508
even before the shaman said it.

67
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,970
Detectives should rely on
scientific methods, not superstitions.

68
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:26,891
Listen. We're grasping at straws here
because there's nothing else to go on.

69
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,311
I'm not going to grasp at straws.
I'm going to grasp the killer.

70
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:35,066
Jeez, you really have a knack
for making things awkward as hell.

71
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,484
I'm heading out to investigate.

72
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,279
You can't just leave like this.
What does that make me?

73
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,657
Shall I go ask the shaman?

74
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,909
Sure. And while you're there,

75
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:49,414
ask him whether your husband
is cheating again, why don't you?

76
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,465
Mr. Park, are you okay?

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,678
Why am I here?

78
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,514
You fainted during the rite.

79
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,975
You were running a fever all night.

80
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,570
I fainted?

81
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,864
Do you not remember?

82
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,285
I remember performing the rite,

83
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,414
but I don't remember
a single thing after that.

84
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,127
You said that the killer
was among the people who came to watch.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,964
You don't remember that either?

86
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,507
No.

87
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,176
I don't remember a thing.

88
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,932
I'll come back after work.

89
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,975
Get some rest.

90
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,476
Are you okay,

91
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,393
sis?

92
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,605
What the hell am I doing?

93
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,161
Is here okay?

94
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,871
Yes.

95
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,957
But what are you doing here this early?

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,583
I was on my way to work,

97
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,460
but it was a little hot today, so…

98
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,655
That'll be 3,000 won.

99
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,661
What's wrong?

100
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,539
No, it's just…

101
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,467
Ye-bun!

102
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,469
-There's a problem!
-What happened?

103
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,720
I think I'm sick.

104
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,054
What do you mean?

105
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,141
Fireworks are going off like crazy,
and I hear bells ringing.

106
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,476
What are you talking about?

107
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,394
Everyone looks like a squid
except for one guy.

108
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,937
Who? Detective Moon?

109
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,314
No!

110
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,316
That's why I think I'm sick!

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,860
The person who looks most like a squid
doesn't look like one!

112
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,361
So you have another crush.

113
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,696
This is natural.

114
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,616
When you like someone,
everyone else looks like a squid to you.

115
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,994
Some hear bells ringing,
and others see fireworks.

116
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,037
Come with me.

117
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,209
It's that guy over there.

118
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,676
Ok-hui.

119
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,721
You are sick.

120
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,931
You're really sick.

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,474
Come here.

122
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,436
It's 37.1 degrees Celsius.

123
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,189
It's hard to tell
whether you're running a fever.

124
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,649
I'm definitely sick.

125
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,984
I should head home and rest.

126
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,528
What about the store?

127
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,279
There's no one around anyway.

128
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,241
The streets have been empty
since what happened to Mr. Park.

129
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,035
That shaman is a fraud.
Do people really believe him?

130
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,788
He apparently used to get things right.

131
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,457
And what he said
isn't something you can easily brush off.

132
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,711
I guess the killer could've been curious
and come to see the rite.

133
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,798
Right? He must be curious
about the investigation too.

134
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,591
There's no doubt about it.

135
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,804
They say that criminals
always return to the scene of the crime.

136
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,765
He's probably hiding
and watching what the police are doing.

137
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,852
Then he's probably seen you
and Detective Moon looking for evidence.

138
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,354
Of course.

139
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,606
Who found the first body?

140
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,191
It was me, right?

141
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,443
And I was there
when the second victim died.

142
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,153
Unless he's stupid,

143
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,281
he must know that I'm trying to find him.

144
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,827
Then you must be such a nuisance
to that serial killer.

145
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,744
Of course.

146
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,705
I bet he can't wait to get rid of me.

147
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,670
Ok-hui,

148
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,463
what do I do?

149
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,757
I shouldn't have been
poking around like that.

150
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,967
I must have been out of my mind.

151
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:54,969
What do I do?

152
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,139
This is all because of that nutjob.

153
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,226
NUTJOB

154
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,312
Speak of the devil.

155
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,896
Hello?

156
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,315
Let's finish what we started.

157
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,066
A thousand people a day, remember?

158
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,070
Sorry, but my power was gone
when I woke up this morning.

159
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,281
So I don't think I can help you again.

160
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,450
I'll call you if my power ever comes back.

161
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,118
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,453
I dropped my phone in the toilet!

163
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,039
What? Hey!

164
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,582
Whatever.

165
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,375
This is better than getting murdered.

166
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,129
What the…

167
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
What do I do now?

168
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm in front of the hospital.
I'm going in.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,473
Tell him you didn't see me, okay?

170
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,807
Where are you…

171
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,774
All criminals are the same.

172
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,193
Their patterns never change.

173
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,783
You've been doing so well until now.
What's gotten into you?

174
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,787
The serial killer's next target
could be me.

175
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,746
What?

176
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,705
Think about it.

177
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,208
The serial killer knows
that the police are after him.

178
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,335
So he's watching from afar.

179
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,089
But then he sees this cute girl
who's not even a police officer

180
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,548
visiting the crime scenes.

181
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,384
So the serial killer will wonder,

182
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,885
"Who's that girl?"

183
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,011
He'll get curious.

184
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,889
That's when he starts
watching my every move.

185
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,767
And he'll eventually see me
touching people's butts and think,

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,479
"She doesn't look like a pervert,
so why is she touching people's butts?"

187
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,065
With that question in his head,
he'll end up finding out

188
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,900
the real reason I touch butts.

189
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,986
"So she's psychic."

190
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,447
"Then she'll eventually find out
that I'm the killer

191
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,867
because she is not only psychic
but also smart."

192
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,911
-Smart?
-That's when he thinks,

193
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,997
"It's such a shame
to kill someone as good as her,

194
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,834
but I have no choice
since I have to live."

195
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,128
Then he'll put on that rain poncho,

196
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,213
pick up the rose knife, and make a call.

197
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,631
"Hello, is this Bong's Animal Hospital?"

198
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,801
"I have a sick puppy here.
Could you come take a look?"

199
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,928
Then I'll feel too bad to say no.

200
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,055
So I decide to go,
but something doesn't feel right.

201
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,058
There are no CCTVs or people around.

202
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,477
A perfect place to kill a person.
Just then--

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,813
-Are you done yet?
-Hold on. I'm about to die.

204
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,730
Just then!

205
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,024
That bastard comes charging at me

206
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,651
and attacks…

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,654
I think your mouth will get you killed.

208
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,740
Of course, you don't have to worry.

209
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,160
You have a gun and you can fight.
But what about me?

210
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,953
I have no weapon on me. I'm helpless.

211
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,329
What do you mean, you have no weapon?

212
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,332
I'm your weapon.

213
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,002
Do you think
I'm going to let anyone kill you?

214
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,099
Is this really necessary?

215
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,017
Why don't you just…

216
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,560
Keep your distance.

217
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,604
What if the killer figures things out?

218
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,357
Fine.

219
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,867
A better Mujin.
Mujin, the center of tourism.

220
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,328
I'll make our beautiful Mujin
a city bustling with tourists.

221
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,372
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man!

222
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,834
When I say that I will develop Mujin
and turn it into a tourist spot…

223
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,127
Father.

224
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,256
-What are you doing here?
-"Tourism destroys the environment."

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,758
No way.

226
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,969
You're not working
with Cha Ju-man, are you?

227
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,805
Times have changed.

228
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,183
-There are many ways…
-Come with me.

229
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,269
to develop the city
and turn it into a tourist spot.

230
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,188
I'm so hungry.

231
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:40,069
I just regained consciousness,
and I have no one to cook for me.

232
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,157
I guess this is my life
without my family here.

233
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,369
RAMYEON

234
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,088
Go on.

235
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,800
You can tell me.

236
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,844
Who's the killer?

237
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,721
Excuse me?

238
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,727
Since when were you all here?
I didn't see you when I went in.

239
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,272
Come.

240
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,773
Have a seat.

241
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,026
Here, eat.

242
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,070
Are you feeling any better?

243
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,491
Was it all true?

244
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,577
Was what true?

245
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,412
You know.

246
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,039
You said so during the rite,

247
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,876
"The person who killed me is here."

248
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,836
Was it true?

249
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,841
The thing is…

250
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,261
You can't ask him about those things.

251
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,973
If he divulges such heavenly secrets,

252
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,518
he'll be struck with misfortune.
Isn't that right?

253
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,896
-Yes.
-Right.

254
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,356
It's Man-sik, isn't it?

255
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,486
Nod if it's a yes,
and shake your head if it's a no.

256
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,531
It's not Man-sik.

257
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:11,702
He may be a little rough around the edges,
but he's actually nice.

258
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,246
It's Dong-sik, right?

259
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,457
Watch what you say.

260
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,710
Dong-sik fixed my bathroom the other day.

261
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
It's not him.

262
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,879
Then who is it?

263
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,883
Then is it Sang-min?

264
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,888
Sang-min was Ok-hui's classmate.

265
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,348
It can't be him.

266
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,974
-I guess not.
-It's not him.

267
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,268
If we exclude former classmates,
relatives, neighbors,

268
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,062
and anyone who fixed our bathrooms,

269
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,980
who are we left with?

270
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,783
Hey, don't we come
from the same family clan?

271
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,285
The Miryang Park clan.

272
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,746
That's right. Then it's not her either.

273
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,539
It's not me.

274
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,749
Then who could it be?

275
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,460
Just wait.

276
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:05,089
Our shaman here
must have it all figured out.

277
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,006
Isn't that right?

278
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,345
I guess you can say that.
Yes, you're right.

279
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,390
Then tell us.

280
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,018
What happens now?

281
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,146
You can see everything, right?

282
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,611
The truth is…

283
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,863
-Yes?
-He's a shaman for a reason.

284
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,449
He's seen everything.

285
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,201
Haven't you?

286
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,834
The thing is,

287
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:47,256
I think there's going to be
another big incident soon.

288
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,632
Oh, my.

289
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,759
-My goodness.
-What do we do?

290
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,011
This is bad.

291
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,638
What are we supposed to do?

292
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,311
We were once family,

293
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,563
so how about a glass of--

294
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,148
Why on earth are you back in Mujin?

295
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,609
Aren't you ashamed to see Hyeon-ok?

296
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,195
Father.

297
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,240
Everyone makes mistakes.

298
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,868
I made a lot of mistakes in the past,

299
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,079
but I'm here to start over with Hyeon-ok.

300
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,915
People don't change.

301
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,085
What do you mean? People can change.

302
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,047
You changed too.

303
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,258
How can you be supporting
Cha Ju-man's election campaign?

304
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,218
Weren't you basically enemies with him?

305
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,095
I still can't stand the sight of him.

306
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,847
I guess you've changed.

307
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,934
You don't have dementia
or something, do you?

308
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,270
-I'm home.
-You…

309
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,318
What are you doing here?

310
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,487
Father, why did you let him in?

311
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,113
Don't say another word and leave.

312
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,408
Don't ever set foot in Mujin again.

313
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,705
Have you lost your mind?

314
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,623
Get out.

315
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,458
Get out!

316
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,085
-You must be out of your mind.
-Let go.

317
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,048
Back then, I was drinking because
my business wasn't doing well, and…

318
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,926
I was a jerk back then.

319
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,638
But I've quit drinking.
I won't make the same mistake again.

320
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,599
So please just give me one more chance.

321
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,602
Just give me one more chance, please.

322
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,817
I've already given you countless chances.

323
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,985
I don't want to hear your excuses anymore.

324
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,742
I like someone else now.

325
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,662
So don't ever show up in front of me.

326
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,163
And don't get in my way.

327
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,668
I liked that person before I even met you.

328
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,877
It's someone

329
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,339
I never ever want to lose.

330
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,348
I'm not letting him go again.

331
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,862
What's going on?

332
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,952
A power outage?

333
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Oh, my gosh!

334
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,966
It's your dad.

335
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,552
You scared the heck out of me!

336
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,846
Why do you have the lights off?

337
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,514
They went out on their own.

338
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:43,932
They did?

339
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,518
They were flickering for days.

340
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,145
I guess it's time to replace them.

341
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,148
Right, Ok-hui.

342
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,152
You should stay put at home
for the time being.

343
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,069
Why?

344
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,447
The shaman said

345
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,451
there's going to be another incident.

346
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,938
Is that brat Ae-ran not back yet?

347
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,481
No.

348
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,108
Did she run away again?

349
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,903
Do you know anything?

350
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,404
No.

351
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,203
Kim, it looks like Ae-ran has run off.

352
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,081
Have some men on the lookout
at the terminal and by the docks.

353
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,291
That brat.

354
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,835
MUJIN POLICE STATION

355
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,928
I'm here, but I'm not going in.

356
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,681
Seriously?

357
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,606
Excuse me.

358
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,025
Yes?

359
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,701
You can tell me what's going on.

360
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,245
The thing is…

361
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,550
It's okay.

362
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,051
She's got a few screws loose.

363
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,762
You know, there's someone like her
in every neighborhood.

364
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,848
So you don't need to mind her.

365
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,686
Ae-ran went out last night
and hasn't come back.

366
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,104
Ae-ran?

367
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,149
She works with me at Mujin Coffee Shop.

368
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,359
I can't reach her.

369
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,445
Our boss said she must have run off,

370
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,822
but I don't think that's it.

371
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,199
You're saying she didn't just run away?

372
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,202
Something definitely happened to her.

373
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,414
Things have been so unsettling these days.

374
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,250
What if someone did
something terrible to her?

375
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,505
Please find Ae-ran.

376
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,217
The poor girl's had such a hard life.

377
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,683
MUJIN CHILDREN'S HOME 30,000
LOVE CHILDREN'S HOME 50,000

378
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,602
What's this?

379
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,729
Why are you sending money
to children's homes?

380
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,066
Because my little brother could be there.

381
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,985
"Could be there?"

382
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,737
So you don't even know for sure?

383
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,406
When I was young,

384
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,201
I lost

385
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,787
my baby brother.

386
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,749
I wanted to play with my friend alone

387
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,628
and he kept following me.

388
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,547
So I lied and said I was going to school.

389
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,717
By the time I got back home,

390
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,386
he wasn't there.

391
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,519
He must have gone to school to find me.

392
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,938
And…

393
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,024
we never found him again.

394
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,860
It must've been so hard for you.

395
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:30,325
My parents passed away
after spending years trying to find him.

396
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,287
All because of me.

397
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:45,048
She would send all the money she could
to any children's home she could find

398
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,967
on the off chance her brother was there.

399
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,636
Even though she lived hand to mouth.

400
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,472
That's who she is.

401
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,433
Detective.

402
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,855
Something must've happened to her.
I just know it.

403
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,732
Please find her.

404
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,862
Please save her.

405
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,618
We'll help you.

406
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,704
We promise we'll find your friend.

407
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,544
Yes, we will.

READINGS THROUGH SPIRITS
FORTUNE TELLING

409
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,352
He's here!

410
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,270
There he is.

411
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,774
My goodness, you really are incredible.

412
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,943
-I'm sorry?
-Another incident happened,

413
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,320
just like you predicted.

414
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,697
Ae-ran from Mujin Coffee Shop
has disappeared!

415
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,157
Listen.

416
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,327
My eldest is applying for college soon.
Will my kid get into college?

417
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,453
Sorry?

418
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:01,291
My husband seems to be cheating on me.
Can you see who that other woman is?

419
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,002
My grandfather
keeps appearing in my dreams.

420
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,087
Can you read my fortune
and find out what's going on?

421
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,964
That's right, tell me!

422
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,300
I have the most urgent problem here!

423
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,010
I got here first!

424
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,261
Get out of the way!

425
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,806
What brings you here today?

426
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,643
All of my businesses fail.

427
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,770
You were born around midnight?

428
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,022
Now, what do you see? Let's see.

429
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,317
Let's proceed to land.

430
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
Oh, my.

431
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,738
Then I'll give you a talisman.

432
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,543
Aren't you going to eat?

433
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,463
I don't feel hungry.

434
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,758
You've made a lot of money today.

435
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,095
Mr. Kim, I think I got my powers back.

436
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,639
That's great.

437
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,891
Are you going somewhere?

438
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,226
Wait a second.

439
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,022
You're not going to the convenience store

440
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,024
but somewhere else today, aren't you?

441
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,694
Yes, that's right.

442
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,279
I'm going somewhere else today.

443
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
Oh, yeah. Did you hear the news?

444
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,291
What news?

445
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,418
Ae-ran from Mujin Coffee Shop
has disappeared.

446
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,837
Could it be the killer
that the shaman talked about?

447
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,844
About Ae-ran…

448
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,430
Don't you think people are blowing it up
when she just ran away?

449
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,931
That's what I'm saying.

450
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:45,186
People in her line of work
tend to disappear and come back

451
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,604
-from time to time.
-Right.

452
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,733
It might not be that simple.

453
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,486
She hasn't been using
her credit card, phone,

454
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,613
or even her public transportation card.

455
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,908
There are no signs that she's still alive.

456
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,869
What are you trying to say?

457
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,121
Given the situation right now,

458
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,458
we shouldn't investigate this
as a simple runaway case

459
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,460
but as the work of a serial killer.

460
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,045
That way, we won't make any mistakes.

461
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,632
You're so gross.

462
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,633
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,593
I mean…

464
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:21,514
My husband spends days out
without any signs of being alive

465
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,099
only to come back home just fine.

466
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,187
He leaves signs of cheating though.

467
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,272
And this guy here is like dirty underwear.

468
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,399
Excuse me?

469
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,443
"You iffy bastard."

470
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,779
That's what he means.

471
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,865
I'm sorry. What's wrong with me?

472
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,494
SUNDAE GUKBAP, BEAN SPROUT GUKBAP

473
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,914
But this doesn't seem like
the serial killer's work.

474
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,540
Detective Na,

475
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,459
have you not watched any crime TV shows?

476
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,797
It always turns out to be a serial murder
when you least expect it.

477
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,632
She could have gotten into an accident,

478
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,176
so let's check
all the hospitals around Mujin.

479
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,970
We should also search for the bike
that Ms. Cho Ae-ran was riding.

480
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:01,888
Sure.

481
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,599
Detective Na, you check all the hospitals.

482
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,351
And Detective Bae, you come with me.

483
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,268
Why?

484
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,188
Haven't you seen any crime movies?

485
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,274
It's always the captains that die first

486
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,068
because they insist on acting alone.

487
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,986
That's ridiculous.

488
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,530
You be careful too.

489
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,116
Those who say that tend to die first.

490
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,159
The captain and the youngest one
are in the most danger.

491
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,077
Let's go.

492
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,915
Hey!

493
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,500
Where are you going?

494
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,335
I'm going to investigate on my own.

495
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,047
I'm heading to the hospital.
Meet me outside.

496
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,676
I guess he'll be the first one to die.

497
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,720
People who go off alone like that
always die first.

498
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,307
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

499
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,934
Seon-woo.

500
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,021
Are you going to work?

501
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,607
No, I'm going somewhere else today.

502
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,569
I guess you're going someplace nice.

503
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,529
Where are you going?

504
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,365
Just somewhere.

505
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,201
Just somewhere?

506
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:06,995
Where exactly?

507
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,125
I got myself a workshop.

508
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,043
A workshop?

509
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,629
It's for something
I've been doing as a hobby.

510
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,298
I'm still setting it up though.

511
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,550
That's so cool.

512
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,886
So what's your hobby?

513
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,264
It's kind of embarrassing to talk about.

514
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,770
I'll get going then.

515
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,773
Why, that little…

516
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,153
I told her to wait outside the hospital.

517
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,363
Where is she going?

518
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,505
So this is your workshop.

519
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,674
It's just a cheap, shabby place.

520
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,606
My hobby is woodworking.

521
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,025
I want to start making things.

522
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,403
I see.

523
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,448
Did you make this yourself too?

524
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,576
Yes.

525
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,453
You're really good with your hands.

526
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,754
I'm sorry, but I need to take this.

527
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,264
Hello?

528
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:34,225
Why aren't you coming out?
I told you to meet me outside.

529
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:35,977
I just…

530
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,062
I wanted to wash up before heading out.

531
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,191
What was that sound?

532
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,860
Sounded like the wind.

533
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,570
It's my hairdryer.

534
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,614
Let me dry my hair real quick.

535
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,948
Is that right?

536
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,867
Your shoelace is untied by the way.

537
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,463
So this is your house?

538
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,382
Let's go.

539
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,926
What?

540
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,719
Let me just say bye to Seon-woo.

541
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,304
No, there's no time for that.

542
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,805
-It won't take long.
-Come on.

543
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,726
Forget it.

544
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,660
I said, let go!

545
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:37,163
Let's go somewhere quiet to talk!
Stop making me the bad guy.

546
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,291
-I don't want anything to do with you!
-Just get in.

547
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,418
What are you so afraid of?

548
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,531
What are you doing?

549
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,953
Hey.

550
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,163
What the hell are you…

551
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,670
Jong-muk.

552
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,066
Why are we at the hospital?

553
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,151
Excuse me, Doctor.

554
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:49,944
Can I ask you a question?

555
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,196
I ran for the first time in a while,

556
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,073
and I think my knees are swollen now.

557
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,408
What should I do?

558
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,909
Sorry, I'm not that kind of doctor.

559
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,165
-It's okay.
-Okay.

560
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,085
Do you like that guy that much?

561
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,671
I won't deny that I like him.

562
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,423
Do you even know him?

563
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,632
He's a good guy.

564
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,259
You only just met him.

565
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,595
People who look like him can't be bad.

566
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:20,308
People who look like him
usually turn out to be psychopaths.

567
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,768
Don't you talk smack about my Seon-woo.

568
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,520
"My Seon-woo"?

569
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,189
More like "Guy I'd like to soon woo."

570
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,857
What, are you trying to be funny?

571
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,150
So corny.

572
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,443
You're making me cringe.

573
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,279
Mark my words.

574
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,199
You'll get hurt if you like him.

575
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,828
MUJIN COFFEE SHOP

576
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,544
I don't know how that rumor started,

577
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,630
but Ae-ran just went back to her hometown.

578
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,382
Ji-suk didn't know the full story
when she made the report.

579
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:54,801
Didn't you?

580
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,931
Her hometown must be close

581
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,516
if she went there by motorcycle.

582
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,562
Anyway, I have nothing else to tell you.

583
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,356
So please leave.

584
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,566
Get ready to make deliveries, Ji-suk.

585
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,526
Yes, ma'am.

586
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,279
Touch her when you can.

587
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,119
Look at you.

588
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,912
You can't serve customers
looking like that.

589
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,623
I'll buy you some clothes
and makeup for now.

590
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,125
What's with your look?

591
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,085
That's how much I spent
on your clothes and makeup.

592
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,211
Twenty million won?

593
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,672
Yes, so you should work hard
to pay me back.

594
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
I'm going to kill you.

595
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,448
You told me to touch her.

596
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,117
When the timing's right!

597
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,243
You can't just…

598
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,078
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

599
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,747
Come on, I'm risking my life to help you.

600
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,335
Whatever. Did you see anything?

601
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,921
She's lying.

602
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,465
I didn't see Ae-ran saying
she was going to her hometown.

603
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,550
Really?

604
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,220
You know,

605
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,222
you shouldn't believe what my boss says.

606
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,975
She didn't want the police
getting involved, so she--

607
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,934
You!

608
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,770
Why are you still here?

609
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,564
Go. And make sure to bring back the cups.

610
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,024
Yes, ma'am.

611
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,491
That keychain…

612
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,829
Sorry?

613
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,039
What about it?

614
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,249
Did you buy that somewhere?

615
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,668
No. Ae-ran made it for me.

616
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,380
She made two of these
for our motorcycle keys

617
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,299
and gave one to me.

618
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,480
What is it? Is something bothering you?

619
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,606
What?

620
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,941
No.

621
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,654
You better be honest with me.

622
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,866
I just think
I've seen that keychain somewhere.

623
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,327
Go touch him.

624
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,578
I don't want to.

625
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,913
He must've bought it somewhere.

626
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,581
She said Ae-ran made it!

627
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,250
So go touch him!

628
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:33,668
I said no!

629
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,461
You wanted to touch his butt before.

630
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,172
But this is different!

631
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,090
What's wrong?

632
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,675
People who look like him are always good.

633
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,386
And he is good.
So I don't need to touch him.

634
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,764
What are you going to do
if he turns out to be the serial killer?

635
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,392
We need to catch him quick
or else you'll be in more danger.

636
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,122
Seon-woo.

637
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,041
You have gum on your butt.

638
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,209
What?

639
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,086
I'll get it off of you.

640
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:35,479
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man!

641
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,897
Thank you.

642
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,649
I'm candidate number one, Cha Ju-man.

643
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,573
Are you the seller?

644
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,491
Yes, where's the money?

645
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,535
Here.

646
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,619
And the laptop?

647
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,498
It looks good.

648
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
Can I get a discount?

649
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,793
I wrote, "No discounts" on my post.

650
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,338
Mr. Handsome. Here's a flash drive.

651
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,089
Just take this instead, okay?

652
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,299
Sure.

653
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,134
What about the keychain?

654
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,510
That one's a freebie.

655
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,309
-Did you touch him?
-Goodness.

656
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,977
Look here.

657
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,772
You shouldn't suspect people
for no reason.

658
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,400
My Seon-woo would never do such a thing.

659
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,611
You saw what happened?

660
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,196
What's up with the keychain?

661
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,366
He bought a secondhand laptop,

662
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,910
and the seller threw it in for free.

663
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,119
Secondhand?

664
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,622
So you saw the keychain
but not the motorcycle?

665
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,417
Kids who looked like high schoolers
were riding the motorcycle.

666
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,752
High schoolers?

667
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,891
Ok-hui.

668
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,187
Just keep your eyes closed.

669
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,148
I'll do anything you say, sis.

670
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,664
Good morning, sir.

671
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,873
Hello, sir.

672
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,001
Do Hyeon-u!

673
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,045
Put on your tie properly!

674
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,924
I found him! Do Hyeon-u.

675
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,219
Do Hyeon-u?

676
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,930
You know him, right?
Where is he right now?

677
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,515
Why do you ask?

678
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,435
He stole a motorcycle
that's related to a case.

679
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,187
And that motorcycle
is a key piece of evidence.

680
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,984
Well…

681
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,488
I'm sorry, Detective.

682
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,576
But can you leave it to me
to find that motorcycle?

683
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,716
If he's riding a motorcycle at his age,
he must be a delinquent.

684
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,676
Kids these days are nothing to mess with.

685
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,428
Aren't you scared?

686
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,346
We're all doomed

687
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,348
when teachers
start fearing their students.

688
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,320
Do Hyeon-u!

689
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,781
Hey!

690
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,424
How dare that bastard
hit the gas in front of me?

691
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,550
Hold on tight.

692
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,532
Hyeon-u, did you steal this motorcycle?

693
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,742
I didn't steal it. I found it.

694
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:20,287
Finding something and not returning it
to the owner is called stealing.

695
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,876
You know what to do
when you've done something wrong, right?

696
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,604
It hurts, right?

697
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,148
It hurts for me too.

698
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,609
But when a student does something wrong,

699
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,404
the teacher needs to take responsibility.

700
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,543
Hello, Detective Moon.

701
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:11,839
I texted you the address
where the motorcycle was found.

702
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,799
Yes, and I apologize again.

703
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,051
I'll make sure
this never repeats in the future.

704
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,303
Okay, sir.

705
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,017
I'm jealous.

706
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,977
Of what?

707
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,063
I don't think
I would've ended up like this

708
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,482
if I had a teacher like you.

709
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,862
Excuse me for a second, sis.

710
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:44,288
You're already dazzling enough.

711
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,294
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm sorry, sis.

712
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,588
-Let's go.
-Okay, sis.

713
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,550
-Walk back on your own.
-Yes, sis.

714
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,360
-This is where the motorcycle was, right?
-Yes.

715
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,079
Oh, my gosh. Isn't this blood?

716
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,003
Look at this.

717
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,339
Based on the bloodstains,

718
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,175
it seems that the victim
was stabbed at random.

719
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,594
Just like the streamer and Seung-gil.

720
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,313
And these bloodstains

721
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:55,234
are evidence that the victim
was dragged while they were unconscious.

722
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,320
The victim is likely to be dead.

723
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,284
Detective! Over here!

724
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,836
This is our third victim, isn't it?

725
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,759
Where are you going?

726
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,897
MUJIN POLICE STATION

727
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,443
Okay.

728
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,782
But was Ae-ran really killed
by the rain poncho guy as well?

729
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,579
Captain.

730
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,997
The DNA results came back.

731
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,998
What does it say?

732
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,543
The DNA found on the knife matches the DNA
pulled from Ae-ran's toothbrush.

733
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:01,383
Who the hell is committing
such terrible crimes in Mujin?

734
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,510
And why would he kill
a poor girl like her?

735
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,637
There's still a possibility
that she's alive.

736
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,473
What are you going on about now?

737
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,475
We haven't found her body.

738
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,103
It's too early to assume
that she was murdered.

739
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,646
Right?

740
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,815
You could be right.

741
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,108
Not the way I see it.

742
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,945
The victim is definitely dead
based on the killer's pattern.

743
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,947
What are you talking about?

744
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:29,745
The police must always assume
the victim is alive until a body is found.

745
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,039
That'd make us more desperate.

746
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,750
But where's Detective Bae?

747
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,628
I sent him to get the security footage.

748
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,756
Come on, we're dealing with
a pretty thorough bastard.

749
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,883
He seems to know
the ins and outs of Mujin.

750
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,968
I doubt he was caught on any CCTV.

751
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:46,845
I'm sure

752
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,972
that he was caught this time.

753
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,937
The killer was caught
on the security camera!

754
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,396
Really?

755
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,648
But why?

756
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,990
I guess they're not
as thorough as I thought.

757
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,328
After this, they went into a blind spot.

758
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,915
I guess this proves
that this is the serial killer's work.

759
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,416
Right.

760
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,170
Okay, we'll start investigating this
as the work of a serial killer.

761
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,299
Where was the victim's
last known destination again?

762
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,718
I'll go there and check.

763
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,057
JAMYEON EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

764
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,060
Ae-ran came here
to deliver coffee that day.

765
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,020
Did she leave right away?

766
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,774
Yes, she said she'd get in trouble
with her boss if she were late.

767
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,193
Is there anything else that you remember?

768
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,529
I'm not sure.

769
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,409
I had a drink that afternoon,
so my memory is kind of fuzzy.

770
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,537
You don't remember well?

771
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,096
Sir, you have a sticky note stuck on you.

772
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,309
It's stuck to him over there.

773
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:23,025
Sir, there's a sticky note
stuck on your butt.

774
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,360
-What?
-I'll get it off for you.

775
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,570
Thank you.

776
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,075
Stay a little longer.

777
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,827
I'll get in trouble with my boss.

778
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,083
You should have been here on time.

779
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:43,420
I just came from delivering
Ppoppi's four puppies.

780
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,840
Animals' lives matter to me
just as much as people's lives.

781
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,550
Tell me what you saw.

782
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,303
After she made the delivery,

783
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,013
she went that way.

784
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,640
That way?

785
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,434
The coffee shop is the other way though.

786
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,687
But she always went this way
when she came here.

787
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,733
Can you get to the coffee shop this way?

788
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,485
I don't think so.

789
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,987
It's not in the direction
of the crime scene either.

790
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,199
Which means that she went somewhere else
every time she came here.

791
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,995
-Was she delivering the yogurt drinks?
-What?

792
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,457
There were two unopened bottles of yogurt
inside the bundle.

793
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,753
Yes, Captain.

794
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,798
Cho Ae-ran's final destination
seems to have been someplace else.

795
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,841
Understood.

796
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,679
Let's go in the direction
where the victim went.

797
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,687
There's nowhere to make a delivery here.

798
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,149
I know where this path leads.

799
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,859
Where does it lead?

800
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,241
Hi, Gwang-sik.

801
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:56,743
Hey.

802
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,497
What brings you here, Dr. Bong?

803
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,500
Detective Moon, you're here too.

804
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,835
Yes, hello.

805
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:09,798
He wanted some freshly squeezed milk
delivered to his home,

806
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:10,882
so I brought him here.

807
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,843
If you had just told me,

808
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,178
I would've brought some to you
when I was in town.

809
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,806
There's no reason
for you to go through all this trouble.

810
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,642
You must be very busy
with your investigation.

811
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,019
Well, it's my job.

812
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,772
Detective Moon.

813
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,318
I heard about what happened to Ae-ran.

814
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,696
That poor girl.

815
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,699
Did you know her well?

816
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,661
I doubt there's anyone in Mujin
who hasn't been to her coffee shop.

817
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,789
Then she must have made
deliveries here too.

818
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,417
Not really.

819
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,210
That never happened.

820
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,254
I just saw her a few times
at the coffee shop.

821
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,423
I didn't know her well.

822
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,469
Gwang-sik!

823
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,428
I'm hungry.

824
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,221
Play with me. Stop working.

825
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,432
I adore you. What do I do?

826
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,519
Detective Moon,

827
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,105
you must work out a lot.

828
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,106
Your thighs…

829
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,277
are like the thighs of a horse!

830
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,403
They're not that…

831
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,947
Flex your muscles for me, Detective.

832
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,532
What? I mean…

833
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,700
Oh, they're all fat.

834
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,952
Don't you see
he has the legs of a newborn calf?

835
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,331
-I'm busy, let's go.
-What…

836
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,373
-Bye, Gwang-sik.
-Wait.

837
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,625
-Hurry up.
-Hey.

838
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,044
Bye, Dr. Bong.

839
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,504
Get home safely.

840
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,008
-What did you say?
-Come on, quickly!

841
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,135
The legs of a newborn calf?

842
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,887
Touch them again!

843
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,680
That's not what's important right now!

844
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,682
Gwang-sik lied.

845
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,892
What do you mean?

846
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,852
I saw his memories the other day,

847
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,023
and Ae-ran liked him
and used to visit him a lot.

848
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:50,982
What?

849
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,151
He tried to touch your legs
just now, didn't he?

850
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:54,861
Yes, what about it?

851
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,199
Gwang-sik's actually psychic too.

852
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,784
What?

853
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,162
So you can see memories by touching butts

854
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,832
while Gwang-sik can see them
by touching legs?

855
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,710
-Yes.
-And he tried to touch my legs.

856
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,047
What do you think
he wanted to find out from you?

857
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,717
Do you think he was curious about
how the investigation was going?

858
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,511
Probably.

859
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:23,014
After all, he's definitely related
to this case.

860
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,434
But if he is the culprit in this case,

861
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,937
that means he's the serial killer.

862
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,690
But among his memories, I didn't…

863
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,526
You didn't see him killing
the streamer or Seung-gil.

864
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,902
How did you know?

865
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,243
Let's follow him.

866
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,828
What? Why?

867
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:45,787
If we lose him now,

868
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,206
we may never see Cho Ae-ran
or Jeon Gwang-sik again.

869
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,073
What happened? Where did he go?

870
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,789
Let's split up.
I'll go this way, you go that way.

871
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,333
-Call me if you find him.
-Okay.

872
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,110
Taxi!

873
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,740
Hello. Please follow that truck for me.

874
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,951
Thank you.

875
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:12,582
Sir, I can't lose that truck.
Could you drive a bit faster?

876
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,833
-Okay.
-Thank you.

877
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,007
Could I please use this charger?

878
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,926
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

879
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,934
Detective! I found Gwang-sik,
and I'm following him right now.

880
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,185
I'm in a cab.

881
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,603
Where are you?

882
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,614
MUJIN INDUSTRIAL PLANT

883
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,158
I think he's headed
to Mujin Industrial Plant.

884
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,327
Yes.

885
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,082
But the road here is a little scary.

886
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,588
Sir, please stop the car here.

887
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,090
-Here is fine.
-Okay.

888
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,508
Thank you.

889
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,389
I'm at some kind of warehouse right now.

890
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,141
Yes.

891
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,780
Oh, my.

892
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:31,202
Looks like the next victim
will appear soon.

893
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,164
-What?
-What does that mean?

894
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,427
If you buy this talisman,

895
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:52,015
you'll be able to avoid any misfortune.

896
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,016
How much is it?

897
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,198
I've been following him,
but I don't see him anymore.

898
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,619
I found him.

899
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,413
I'll keep following him.

900
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,688
Dr. Bong.

901
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,606
Yes?

902
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,943
Did you follow me here?

903
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,695
Gwang-sik,

904
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:50,240
why did you lie?

905
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,741
About what?

906
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,160
About Ae-ran.

907
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,373
She used to visit you on the farm a lot.

908
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,667
And she liked you.

909
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:05,130
So why did you pretend
you didn't know her well?

910
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:10,051
Dr. Bong, don't you know
the situation this neighborhood is in?

911
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,471
Everyone is suspicious of one another.

912
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,223
If I had told the truth,

913
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:18,309
everyone would have suspected me,
just as you did.

914
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,314
All right.

915
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,318
Then let me touch your butt just once.

916
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,362
Once it's clear
that you're not the killer,

917
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,990
I'll do everything in my power

918
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,826
to prove your innocence.

919
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,457
What's wrong?

920
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,252
Is there a reason I can't touch you?

921
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:45,962
Dr. Bong,

922
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,174
exactly how much do you know?

923
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,434
Come out already.

924
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,520
Ms. Cho Ae-ran.

925
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,981
I already know everything, so come out.

926
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,078
You'll never touch my legs.

927
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:02,247
And why is that?

928
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,456
Then give it a shot.

929
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,054
Dr. Bong,

930
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,306
then you try to touch me.

931
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,010
Detective Moon.

932
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,887
How did you know?

933
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,391
You were captured on the CCTV
intentionally,

934
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:07,270
and the weapon was just lying there
like it was meant to be found.

935
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,399
The bloodstains were strange too.

936
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,236
When you stab someone,
it leaves a spray of blood.

937
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,197
And blood splatters differently
at different heights.

938
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,200
Our current serial killer stabs at random,

939
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,120
but the blood splatter was uniform
at the scene you staged.

940
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:26,039
And most importantly,

941
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:30,293
the amount of blood found was too little
to say that someone had been killed.

942
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,505
You were probably only able to
slash her hand to stage the scene.

943
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,260
What's the reason you did all of this?

944
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,348
Ae-ran…

945
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:45,892
has debts.

946
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,271
I offered to pay them back,

947
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,399
but her boss wouldn't accept it.

948
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,655
Those debts are just an excuse
to stop me from running away.

949
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,950
The only way for her to live…

950
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,704
was to die.

951
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,000
I understand that you care about Ms. Cho.

952
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,419
But this is still wrong.

953
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,881
I'm sorry.

954
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:22,095
Then what happens to Ae-ran now?

955
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:26,099
I'm not sure.
This is a pretty serious case.

956
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,812
For now, the two of you would have to
follow me to the station.

957
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,355
What?

958
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:42,865
Look.

959
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,412
I ended up telling Detective Moon

960
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,331
that you're psychic too.

961
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,626
That's okay. He seems like a good man.

962
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:58,381
And seeing how you two are an item,

963
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,466
I'm sure he's trustworthy.

964
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,009
What?

965
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:05,388
I saw it when I touched your leg earlier.

966
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,015
You two seem to get along very well.

967
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,726
You're devoted to each other, and--

968
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,144
What are you talking about?

969
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,646
I'm just helping him
with his investigation.

970
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,690
To catch the serial killer.

971
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,238
Right, Dr. Bong.

972
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,200
The night we were hit
by the meteor shower.

973
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:30,496
Did you know there was another person
who was there with us?

974
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,082
Another person?

975
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,542
Yes, I'm sure of it.

976
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,419
I didn't know before,

977
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,922
but I saw it when I touched your leg.

978
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,008
No, that's my name.

979
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,051
She's Geumsil.

980
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:50,808
There was definitely someone else.

981
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:54,562
So there's someone else

982
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:57,023
who is psychic like us?

983
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,658
Bye. Have a good night.

984
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,130
Just toss it. We don't have time for that.

985
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,590
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

986
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:28,364
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

987
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,491
There's someone else who's also psychic.

988
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,450
What?

989
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,412
Gwang-sik saw that person
when he touched my leg.

990
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,998
So that other psychic person

991
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,958
-is the serial killer?
-Yes.

992
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,461
All you need to do is find out
which Mujin resident is psychic.

993
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,213
They're all potentially the killer.

994
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,464
Don't trust me either.

995
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,884
I heard another murder
took place yesterday.

996
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:48,926
This is the third victim.

997
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,095
The murder weapon is indisputable.
There's no doubt about it.

998
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,763
What is the killer most afraid of?

999
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,723
It's you.

1000
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,974
He probably saw your memories.

1001
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,434
-Ye-bun.
-Dr. Bong.

1002
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,477
Dr. Bong, you were fooled.

1003
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,479
Detective Moon,
you're the only person I can trust.

1004
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:04,108
-The rain poncho killer has been spotted.
-What? The rain poncho killer?

1005
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:05,318
Please, help me.

1006
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:11,115
