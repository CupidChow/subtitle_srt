1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,761
You dirty pervert!

3
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,977
You pervert.
This is just a habit for you, isn't it?

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,854
Is your back okay?

5
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
You better watch it.

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,071
I can see memories of people too?

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157
Oh, my back.

8
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,122
What was that?

9
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,999
What did I just see?

10
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,383
Honey,

11
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,761
come get Ok-hui tomorrow too, okey dokey?

12
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,267
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,686
Hey, wait.

14
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,522
-What the hell?
-Why can't I see anything?

15
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,565
What's the deal? Why can't I see anything?

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,650
Oh, wait.

17
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,901
Excuse me for a second.

18
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,695
Have you lost your mind?

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,531
Maybe I did lose my mind.

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,116
What do I do?

21
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,283
What's wrong?

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,289
I got entangled with some nutjob.

23
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,629
It's not like I'll be here for long.

24
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,964
It's just a monthly rental.

25
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,424
Why that little…

26
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,351
Jeez, I should just…

27
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,310
It's nothing.

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,646
There's a neighborhood pervert
running around.

29
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,481
How's the air in Mujin?

30
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,402
It's the same as in Seoul.
Loud traffic and bad air pollution.

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,445
How different could a city be?

32
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,156
But seriously, why did you do that?

33
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,159
A year-long narcotics investigation
went to waste because of you.

34
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,871
And we lost Baek when we totally had him.
All the evidence was destroyed too.

35
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,707
The minute you were
demoted and transferred,

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,168
the bastard started acting
like he's untouchable.

37
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,627
Just wait.

38
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,172
I'll go back to Seoul
and make up for everything.

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,799
How are you going to get back?

40
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,385
That's why I called
to ask you to help me out.

41
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,762
Seriously, there are zero cases here.

42
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,056
Come on, you're putting me
in a tight spot.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,100
Just give me something big I can work on.

44
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,852
-Well, there is something.
-Okay.

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,479
You remember Ted Chang,
who used to deal drugs with Baek?

46
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,858
-You mean Chang-sik?
-He was last headed toward where you are.

47
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,860
So his supply route
must be nearby as well.

48
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,777
Here?

49
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,447
This is strictly confidential.
I'm done for if this gets out.

50
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,532
Got it. Hey, thanks.

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,450
Talk to you later.

52
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,621
Let's do this!

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,415
Chang-sik, Ted Chang, you bastard.

54
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,333
THINGS I CAN SEE

55
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,918
ANIMALS: BIRDS, FISH, MAMMALS (O)
OBJECTS: LOTTERY MACHINE (X)

56
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,544
PEOPLE: OK-HUI, PICKPOCKET (X) NUTJOB (O)

57
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,047
Could I see the nutjob's memories
since he's more of an animal?

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,467
I guess he's definitely less than human.

59
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,891
I wish I at least had
the ability to shoot webs.

60
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,940
I came here
because I heard from Deokgu's owner

61
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,985
that you're great at treating dogs.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,987
Jjonggu isn't eating his kibble.

63
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,533
He used to drool at just the smell of it,

64
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,285
but now he won't even touch it.

65
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,329
He hasn't eaten any in a week.

66
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,830
What could be wrong?

67
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,250
Is that so? I'll take a look.

68
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,835
Jjonggu, let me take a look at you.

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,295
All right.

70
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,473
Do you want a sweet potato? Here you go.

71
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,517
Oh, you're here.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,395
Here, have some of this. It's meat.

73
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,021
Hi, Jjonggu.

74
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,774
-He just keeps coming back.
-Yes, he does.

75
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,654
Your fence must have a hole
that leads out.

76
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,571
What?

77
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,242
I don't think so.

78
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,410
You should look for it.

79
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,204
Block off that hole,
and he'll eat kibble again.

80
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,373
This is just…

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,083
That'll be 13,000 won.

82
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,671
This hospital must be making a fortune.

83
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,674
Our doctor is so skilled, isn't she?

84
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,717
She sure is.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,928
She tells me to find a hole in my fence
without giving any medicine or shots.

86
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,098
And you charge me 13,000 won for that?

87
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,225
I sure hope you people get super rich.

88
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,938
Jjonggu, let's go.

89
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,736
Jjonggu, time for food.

90
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,987
Where did that dog go?

91
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,739
Jjonggu.

92
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,660
Why are you coming from there?

93
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,746
Jjonggu.

94
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,421
Well, I'll be damned.

95
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,798
How did she know?

96
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,473
I'll be handing out numbers.

97
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,308
-Okay.
-Okay.

98
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,484
My dog refuses
to put a collar on for walks.

99
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,443
Why is that?

100
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,403
Is that so? Let me take a look.

101
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,573
Come here, sweetie.

102
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,035
Come here. I need to put on your collar.

103
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,995
I said, come here. Damn it.

104
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:11,954
Come here!

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,167
Did you adopt your dog
from an animal shelter?

106
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,919
Yes, I did.

107
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,964
It seems that the former owner
abused the poor thing with a collar.

108
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,885
Your dog was traumatized,
so try using a harness instead.

109
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,429
You'll need to make extra effort.

110
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,473
Remember to be patient.

111
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,606
Excuse me for a second.

112
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,818
Let's see.

113
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,198
Come here, Baekgu.
Have a good life, all right?

114
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,200
Here.

115
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,201
Don't worry about him.

116
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,674
Who is it?

117
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,681
Baekgu, how did you get here
from so far away?

118
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,558
Oh, my goodness.

119
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,017
Why is Baekgu doing this?

120
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,395
He was really hurt.

121
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,315
I keep calling his name,
but he never comes to me.

122
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,569
I think there must be
something wrong with his ears.

123
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,663
Did you know dogs can look down on people?

124
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,747
What?

125
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,834
Your dog seems to think
that you're lower in rank.

126
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,004
My cat keeps hissing
at corners in my house.

127
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,392
We hit the jackpot. How did you do this?

128
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,269
We're fully booked until lunch.

129
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,523
Maybe the heavens are rewarding me
for being so good.

130
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,066
That must be it.

131
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,652
But what if today's our only lucky day?

132
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,695
Don't worry.

133
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,989
I'll bring in all the money
there is in Mujin.

134
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,284
SHOPPING CART

135
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,786
Ok-hui!

136
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,623
I'm on an absolute roll right now.

137
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,751
I want to strike while the iron is hot,
but I need your help.

138
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,669
Gather some people for me.

139
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,712
For free?

140
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,130
What can I do for you then?

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,549
Done.

142
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,596
All right, I see all of you
are still alive and doing well.

143
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,847
-Yes, sis!
-Yes, sis!

144
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,683
Yeong-hui.

145
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,145
I heard you married well
by hiding your past.

146
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,104
I did, sis.

147
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,651
Mi-yeong? Did you get a nose job?

148
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,778
-It looks good.
-Thank you, sis.

149
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,405
Eun-hye, I heard you set up a salon
with the alimony you got.

150
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,950
-I did, sis.
-So you're still good at sucking men dry.

151
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,369
My goodness.

152
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,455
-Who are you?
-I'm Da-eun's older brother.

153
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,833
-Where's Da-eun?
-She was about to give birth,

154
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,211
but when she saw your message,
she said the baby could wait

155
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,796
and insisted on coming here.

156
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,132
But she had already gone into labor,
so I came here on her behalf.

157
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,634
Where's her husband?

158
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,719
She said he's on
a long-term business trip,

159
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,389
but I'm suspecting they're separated.

160
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,475
You can go and tell Da-eun not to worry.

161
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,271
Okay, but what do I do
about this parking slip?

162
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,106
My car's in the parking tower.

163
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,568
It's free for the first 30 minutes,
but it's already 10 minutes over.

164
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,695
Can I get a validation stamp or something?

165
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,029
I can't help you with that.

166
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,824
Okay then.

167
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,160
I'm going to ask for a show of hands.
Who has a dog or a cat at home?

168
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,421
Ok-hui, that brilliant girl.

169
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,091
Ms. Jung,
you can send in the next patient.

170
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,092
You can head inside.

171
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,471
Welcome.

172
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,035
Doctor?

173
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,455
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

174
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,133
Doctor, I'm not the patient.

175
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,010
This kitten is.

176
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,387
Goodness. Yes, of course.

177
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,892
So what seems to be the problem?

178
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:46,062
It seems abandoned,
so I wanted to get a general checkup.

179
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,191
Would you mind placing it
on the examination table?

180
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,113
It won't take long, sweetie.

181
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,491
Let me take a look.

182
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,996
What are you doing here by yourself?

183
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,547
How beautiful.

184
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,632
Excuse me?

185
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,761
The cat is so beautiful.

186
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,432
Thankfully, there's nothing major to note.

187
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,559
But it's probably not vaccinated.

188
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,353
Because it's still a kitten,

189
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,107
it needs to receive its core vaccines
and a rabies vaccine.

190
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,485
The first round is given
between eight and twelve weeks old.

191
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,571
And the next three rounds
will be in three-week intervals.

192
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,074
Would that be okay?

193
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,370
Or you can get it vaccinated
near where you live instead.

194
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,580
I live around here.

195
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,416
Do you?

196
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,334
And where would that be?

197
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,962
I work at the convenience store
across the street.

198
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,256
Oh, the convenience store.

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,050
I think I've seen you there
a couple of times.

200
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,811
This is complimentary cat food for you.

201
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,855
Here you go.

202
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:12,940
Thank you.

203
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,026
Oh, wait!

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,361
It needs more than just kibble.

205
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,533
These are the best cat treats out there.

206
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,035
I'll throw these in as well.

207
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,663
-Thank you.
-Sure.

208
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,373
Wait!

209
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,377
After eating its kibble and treats,
it should exercise as well.

210
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,381
-Thank you.
-Have a great day.

211
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,096
His skin is like porcelain.

212
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
-He must be from Seoul, right?
-Yes.

213
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,726
His face has "Seoul" written all over it.

214
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,979
I heard the guy in the rooftop room
is from Seoul too.

215
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,398
That guy just has "jerk"
written all over his face.

216
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,195

220
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,118
What are you looking for?

221
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,995
If it were you,

222
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,581
where would you produce drugs around here?

223
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,041
Drugs?

224
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,084
Come on, there's no place for that here.

225
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,045
That's exactly why this place is perfect.

226
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,005
What's the local specialty here?

227
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,757
Any product that's distributed
across the country.

228
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,717
Ark clams and prawns are famous.

229
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,386
And our fish
is distributed nationwide too.

230
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,473
Then let's investigate
the places close by.

231
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,641
Investigate what?

232
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,395
FISHING

233
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,313
Bye.

234
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,565
Hi, Deok-hee.

235
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,483
Hello, sir.

236
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,612
Do a lot of people from other areas
come here to fish?

237
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,448
Yes, the majority
are people from other areas.

238
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,450
And they must come
from across the country.

239
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,368
That's right.

240
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,912
Allow me to take a quick look around.

241
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,832
What's going on?

242
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,921
He's a detective from Seoul.

243
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,491
Why the hell is he eating
fishing paste powder?

244
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,794
Hold on.

245
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,263
Why is he doing that?

246
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,766
I think I know why he was transferred.

247
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,018
Can I grill the shrimp now?

248
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,561
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

249
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:04,194
All right. Before we start on the shrimps,
let me say something first.

250
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,032
My dream is to send my family
abroad one day.

251
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,409
Then they'll leave me alone

252
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,536
as long as I send over money to them.

253
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,872
You could still send them abroad now.

254
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,541
I want to, but I have no kids.

255
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,835
Then you could have one now.

256
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,295
I want to, but I have no wife.

257
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,006
Are you divorced?

258
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,633
He's never been married.

259
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,093
What? How come?

260
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,304
He had a tough first love.

261
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,305
What I mean is,

262
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,808
don't cause any trouble
until I get married.

263
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,519
Please.

264
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,439
Okay, cheers.

265
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,201
Stop it. I have to go to an interview.

266
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,162
This is the least we can do
for our friend getting married.

267
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,373
I already recorded everyone else.

268
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
So just say something, will you?

269
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,043
Okay, let's go.

270
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,753
This is such nonsense.

271
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,049
Gyeong-taek.

272
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,636
Wherever you may be,

273
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,973
I'll always…

274
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,142
cheer you on.

275
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,231
And this may be too late,
but I want to say this to the bride.

276
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,068
Congratulations on your wedding.

277
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,906
I'm sorry, Jong-muk!

278
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,163
My arm is killing me.

279
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,250
My darling niece,
you've worked so hard today.

280
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,043
Is there something I can do for you?

281
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,670
Can we have cold raw fish soup?

282
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,339
I've never tried making that.

283
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,342
Hello.

284
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,511
Hello.

285
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,430
Are you already closed for the day?

286
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
No, we're still open.

287
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,433
What can we help you with?

288
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,686
I think there's a problem with my cow.

289
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,314
Could you come and take a look?

290
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,528
Of course. She can go right now.

291
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,323
What about the soup?

292
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,077
Just a moment.
She'll get ready and come right out.

293
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,830
I don't need to treat cows anymore.

294
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,373
We have enough patients now.

295
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,250
This business is all about people.

296
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,711
There's a reason why
businesses go bust overnight.

297
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,671
But I'm hungry.

298
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,593
Dr. Bong.

299
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,970
Hello.

300
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,474
Are you going on a trip?

301
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,186
Thanks to you,
I'm visiting my family in Australia.

302
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,605
Why is that thanks to me?

303
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,940
It's all thanks to General MacArthur.

304
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,282
If you're going past the terminal,
do you mind dropping me off there?

305
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,244
Sure, get in.

306
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,544
You must be excited
to see your child after such a long time.

307
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,088
That's right.

308
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,800
My kid is excited
about being able to learn K-pop dance.

309
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,844
Thanks to Dr. Bong here,
I was able to be a good father for once.

310
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,888
Can't you just give up being a shaman?

311
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,973
I don't think you're cut out to be one.

312
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,018
I was a pretty competent shaman
back in my days.

313
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,813
I predicted that Ok-hui
wouldn't get into college.

314
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
The whole school knew that.

315
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:30,609
And I was right
about Chun-sik having a son.

316
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,693
He had a daughter.

317
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,112
What?

318
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,031
That's not good at all.

319
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,412
By the way, where's Geumsil?

320
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,041
She must have run off
on the night of the meteor shower.

321
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,835
She just disappeared.

322
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,378
Is that so?

323
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,259
How long has she been like this?

324
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,427
I did something I shouldn't have done.

325
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,640
I gave her calf to another farm
as soon as it was born.

326
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,810
She must have been
so hurt and sad about it

327
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,062
that she's been crying ever since.

328
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,483
Animals have affection
for their young too,

329
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,152
but I took her calf away by force.

330
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,197
I'll take a look.

331
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,707
She was crying due to mastitis.

332
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,835
It can be very painful
for both people and animals.

333
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,255
She'll get better once she gets a shot
that releases the milk.

334
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,344
I had no idea.

335
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,971
My guilt kept me up all night…

336
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,808
-Are you all right?
-What?

337
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,442
So what happened to your hair?

338
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,028
You used to have such thick hair.

339
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,947
It all fell out.

340
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,616
Why?

341
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,995
Did you experience anything weird
after being hit by the meteor shower?

342
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:05,913
What?

343
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,291
-Then it's happening to you too?
-Yes.

344
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,753
I didn't know there was someone like me.

345
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:17,007
I've been seeing things
whenever I touch a leg.

346
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,383
It's the butt for me.

347
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,349
If I touch the leg
of a human or an animal,

348
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,434
I see everything.

349
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,187
-You get visions from people?
-What? You don't?

350
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,649
Sometimes I can see
and other times I can't.

351
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,983
That's strange.

352
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,401
You should be able to.

353
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,278
So what happened to your hair?

354
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,823
The thing is…

355
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,661
I got so excited about
knowing what people were feeling

356
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,955
that I went around
touching everything I could.

357
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,666
But then one day,
I saw that all my hair fell out.

358
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,833
What?

359
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,169
Are you sure
that's what made your hair fall out?

360
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,755
Come on, you know my father.

361
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,383
This isn't genetic.

362
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,966
Dr. Bong.

363
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,846
With great power

364
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,639
comes great hair loss.

365
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,226
…comes great hair loss.

366
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,023
CLOSED INDEFINITELY

367
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
Are you crazy?

368
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,193
Why close down when we're on a roll?

369
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,863
You don't know anything.

370
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,782
No.

371
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,160
-Come on.
-Hey!

372
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,705
I'm doing this for a reason.

373
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,873
What reason?

374
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,876
We haven't earned enough
to cover all the bills yet.

375
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,129
We're still way behind
on our electricity bills.

376
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,214
And you need to earn as much as you can

377
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,883
so that you can get married!

378
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,218
I might not be able to get married at all!

379
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,429
What on earth are you saying?

380
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,890
Do I look like money to you?

381
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,144
Some things are more important than money.

382
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,314
That's true.

383
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,114
CLOSED INDEFINITELY

384
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,209
You should've slept in.
The hospital's closed anyway.

385
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,586
Why are you up so early?

386
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,672
Are you being sarcastic or thoughtful?

387
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:08,470
I went a little too crazy
about money with you, didn't I?

388
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,847
Take your time to rest up
for as much as you want.

389
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,474
Auntie.

390
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,352
Are you okay?

391
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,478
Yes.

392
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,190
And you said you wanted
cold raw fish soup, right?

393
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:23,235
-Let's go eat that today.
-Really?

394
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,320
-Yes, hurry up and get dressed.
-Okay.

395
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:28,198
-Of course.
-It's going to be so good.

396
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,659
-But don't we need a reservation?
-I already made one.

397
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,120
-They're picking us up too.
-Are you serious?

398
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,121
That's amazing.

399
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,539
Here they are.

400
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,623
-Is that them?
-Yes.

401
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,502
I'm going to pig out.
It's going to be so good.

402
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,213
-Hello.
-Hello.

403
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,090
-Hi.
-Thank you.

404
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,260
Hey, my aunt isn't in yet.

405
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,345
What's going on? What are you doing?

406
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,722
-Auntie, what's happening?
-Hello.

407
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,641
Auntie! What the…

408
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,351
-I gave you a good deal.
-Let me go.

409
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,854
What's going on?

410
00:23:58,937 --> 00:23:59,855
Wait a second.

411
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,149
-Dr. Bong, have a good trip.
-Auntie, wait!

412
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,944
Auntie, no!

413
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,156
Auntie!

414
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,624
MUJIN FLATFISH FARM

415
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,086
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

416
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,298
It's lunchtime. Follow me.

417
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,384
Lunch?

418
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,139
I have digestive issues,
so my stomach is in a really bad state.

419
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,475
My kidneys are a mess too,
and my vision is blurry from age.

420
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,228
None of my organs would be of any use.

421
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,315
Oh, no.

422
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,539
Please enjoy.

423
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,418
Well…

424
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,922
I should at least have a taste

425
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,716
to be polite.

426
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,575
Yeom Jong-hyeok?

427
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,495
You're Jong-hyeok, aren't you?

428
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,412
Ye-bun.

429
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,706
You're Jong-hyeok from vet school!

430
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,625
Yes, I am.

431
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,679
You haven't changed at all since college.

432
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,222
You looked like a baby then too.

433
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,641
So you remember.

434
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:03,353
Of course I do. We were only a year apart.

435
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,731
I'm grateful that you remember me.

436
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,151
But didn't you say
that you'd set up a hospital in Seoul?

437
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,738
I'm just working at a friend's hospital.

438
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,449
What about you?

439
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,327
Weren't you going to take over
your grandfather's hospital?

440
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,165
Well, I did.

441
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,209
But it's been tough.

442
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,045
I see.

443
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,468
By the way, what do you do here?

444
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,514
And why are they eating so little?

445
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,018
Ye-bun,

446
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,478
did you come here
without knowing what this place is?

447
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,441
The thing is…

448
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,736
How's the food? Delicious, isn't it?

449
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,323
These flatfish right here aren't imported.

450
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,826
They're all domestically grown.

451
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,495
These flatfish eat better things
than some people.

452
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,833
Immunity boosters, vitamin C,
multivitamins, and the list goes on.

453
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,295
Enjoy your meal.

454
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,256
And I'll see you over there
once you're finished eating.

455
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,466
Okay.

456
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,230
Are all of these flatfish?

457
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:33,193
All you have to do
is inject vaccines into the fish.

458
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:38,156
You just have to inject those
that weigh between 400 to 500 grams.

459
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,366
There's nothing to it.

460
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,298
Vaccine?

461
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,468
Flatfish get shots too?

462
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,303
There are diseases
that flatfish are prone to.

463
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,181
Streptococcal infections,
edwardsiellosis, or vibriosis.

464
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,266
You know, bacterial diseases.

465
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,104
A bacterial disease vaccine.

466
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,146
Oh, gosh!

467
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,817
I guess it's been too long.

468
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,320
But how many fish are even here?

469
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,781
About…

470
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,325
10,000 of them?

471
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,119
10,000?

472
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,039
I'm going to lose all my hair
touching all these fish.

473
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,791
Jong-hyeok.

474
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,709
Where is the butt located on a flatfish?

475
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:33,670
The butt? Why do you ask?

476
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,089
I can't touch any butts right now.

477
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,971
Look here.

478
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,683
Since the abdomen is here,
this would be the back.

479
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,852
Then its butt would be about here.

480
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,396
Oh, come on.

481
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,378
It's flatfish again.

482
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,100
Flatfish again.

483
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,563
Do you have any rockfish?

484
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,828
Hello.

485
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:50,955
What?

486
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,459
I see. Bye.

487
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,047
-It's you, isn't it?
-What do you mean?

488
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,635
Some weirdo is running around
eating all kinds of white powder.

489
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,470
It wasn't me.

490
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,433
I heard you ate some white powder
from the Hana Mart storage room.

491
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,352
That was rat poison, man.

492
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,359
Jang-yeol.

493
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,610
Can I ask you something?

494
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,613
Why are you running around
pulling this stunt?

495
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,451
Korea's most notorious drug dealer
was last seen in this area.

496
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,911
What do you think that means?

497
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,998
It means he's hiding around here
producing drugs.

498
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,416
Where?

499
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,293
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have eaten rat poison.

500
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,550
Given his scale, we're talking about
nationwide distribution.

501
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,093
But what is his supply route?

502
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,929
How about the delivery service?
They travel all over the country.

503
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,348
It's too risky given such a big amount.

504
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,851
There must be another method.

505
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,108
Why are there so many
water tank trucks around here

506
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,360
when there aren't a lot of
raw fish restaurants?

507
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,946
They're for the flatfish farm
on the island nearby.

508
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,364
A flatfish farm?

509
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,325
Yes, they're delivered across the country,

510
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,870
so there are always
a lot of delivery trucks here.

511
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,497
Follow me.

512
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,583
Follow you where?

513
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,252
Why doesn't he ever tell me anything?

514
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,357
Are you sure about this?

515
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,526
It seems pretty ordinary here.

516
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,112
Do you know
what a drug lab can't do without?

517
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,740
-Beats me.
-A delivery system and ventilation fans.

518
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:53,369
-Ventilation fans?
-Cooking up drugs gives off a foul smell.

519
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,537
Like rotten vinegar.

520
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,290
They need ventilation fans
to get rid of that smell.

521
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,961
Look at all those ventilation fans.
And the fish smell masks any other stench.

522
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,713
You're right.

523
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,340
It's perfect.

524
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,472
Auntie, I'm so done with this place.

525
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,683
Did you have enough raw fish soup?

526
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,143
Just looking at a flatfish makes me sick.

527
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,979
Even the air smells fishy.
I can't do this.

528
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,773
Auntie, get me out of here.

529
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,526
I got your pay in advance,
and I already spent it all.

530
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,446
I'm getting out of here no matter what.

531
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,281
You better watch out once I do.

532
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,824
Sure, give it your best shot.

533
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,869
Why don't you swim out with the tides?

534
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,663
Auntie, wait.

535
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,122
Hello?

536
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,057
OXYGEN

537
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,768
I'd rather die out there than in here.

538
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,860
Where are you going?

539
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,365
I'm going for a walk.

540
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,242
Dressed like that?

541
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,370
I was going to go for a walk

542
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,039
and then go catch a couple of flatfish.

543
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,126
I wanted to see the difference
between wild and farmed ones.

544
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,713
My curiosity is on another level, you see.

545
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,798
Is that so?

546
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,675
But you're going to die
going out like that.

547
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,594
-What?
-That's the oxygen tank for welding.

548
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,138
Hold on.

549
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,807
Maybe it's okay since it's still oxygen.

550
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,601
Let's go. I'll see you out front.

551
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,644
No.

552
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,398
I'll just try to control my curiosity.

553
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,201
Yes.

554
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,787
They'll be on the way.

555
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:15,887
Bingo.

556
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,680
Should we raid them?

557
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,932
No, the two of us can't handle this.

558
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,392
Okay.

559
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,771
MUJIN POLICE STATION

560
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,865
How could you call your captain
to come out so early in the morning?

561
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,742
You be the captain then, why don't you?

562
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,328
-What if you're wrong?
-And what if I'm right?

563
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,997
Well I'm here, aren't I?

564
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,290
You're just driving me…

565
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,751
Why am I so dizzy?

566
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,587
Anyone would be dizzy
with that many motion sickness patches.

567
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,864
Use live ammunition.
Shoot if you're threatened.

568
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,325
No, live ammunition is a no.

569
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,910
Things will get out of hand.

570
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,161
Shall we wait for backup?

571
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,413
It's now or never.

572
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,835
Hey, wait.

573
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,716
Freeze!

574
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,009
Don't do anything stupid.

575
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,678
-Get against the wall!
-Come here.

576
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,595
Get a move on!

577
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,139
What's going on?

578
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,127
What the…

579
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,257
You dirty junkie!

580
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,592
What?

581
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,557
Hey, perv.

582
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,517
You again?

583
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,475
Hey.

584
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,268
Who ordered her soup?

585
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,773
Well, I did because she said
she was sick of eating flatfish.

586
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,066
Hey, perv.

587
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,401
Do you come here to hang out?

588
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,946
Are you starting to feel at home here?

589
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,042
You haven't wrapped this up yet?

590
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:34,961
Jong-muk,

591
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,004
what's this about?

592
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,382
You of all people can't do this to us.

593
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,425
I know, I feel bad about this.

594
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,970
But Detective Moon here says he saw it.

595
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,681
So what in the world did he see?

596
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,976
He saw someone from your farm
meet some dude at night,

597
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,228
open up a suitcase,
and taste what was in there.

598
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,897
He really savored it and everything.
I think it's pretty clear at this point.

599
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,733
So I'm asking you what that is!

600
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,948
Are you still going to deny everything?

601
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,204
This is fish food!

602
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,206
Food for the flatfish!

603
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,249
Fish food?

604
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,044
Who are you trying to fool? Sit down.

605
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,632
This is driving me crazy.

606
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:24,427
I'm telling you,
this really is food for the flatfish!

607
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,513
Flatfish also have
their preferences, you know?

608
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,516
I have to feed them something
that they'll enjoy.

609
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,101
Come on.

610
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,813
Since you seem to be an expert on this,

611
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,899
try it and see for yourself
if they're drugs or fish food.

612
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,571
Okay, sure.

613
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,242
All right, let's see.

614
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,563
You're wearing down your gums.

615
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,689
Hey.

616
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,983
Just so you know, I believe you.

617
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,152
Whatever! The train's left the station.

618
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:26,030
Oh, come on. Trains always come back.

619
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,575
-Release him already.
-No can do.

620
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,037
No one is being released
before everyone here is investigated.

621
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,664
Detective Bae, Detective Na,
collect their hair.

622
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,957
-Okay.
-Okay.

623
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,793
Let me collect some of your hair.

624
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,794
Dr. Bong.

625
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,254
I just need a couple strands.

626
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,382
You can't. Don't!

627
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,092
Why? Do you think you'll test positive?

628
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,844
Stay back. Don't come near me.

629
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,847
Don't you dare.

630
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,808
Pluck them!

631
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,561
-No, just…
-Get away from me!

632
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,233
What is our station coming to?

633
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,527
Auntie!

634
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,986
Ye-bun's at the police station again.

635
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,238
-Again?
-Yes.

636
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,157
Do you have any lipstick?

637
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,909
-Lipstick?
-Yes.

638
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,502
This shade won't work on me.

639
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,962
Do you have anything in coral?

640
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,176
Let me go since you're done.

641
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,387
Not until the results come out.

642
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,268
What did we get ourselves into?

643
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,270
I'm sure everything will be all right.

644
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:42,815
Ye-bun.

645
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,443
I'm going to sleep for a bit.

646
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,698
Hey, Deok-hee.

647
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,783
Could you get us a blanket?

648
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,577
Okay.

649
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,373
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

650
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,766
I'm sorry!

651
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,144
You said I was your only man.

652
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,062
You said that you'd only be with me!

653
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,485
What's wrong?

654
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,322
The blanket fell,
so I was putting it back on you.

655
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,073
Thank you.

656
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,074
I got it.

657
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,075
Okay.

658
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,531
I'll kill you.

659
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,002
Jeez, I'm exhausted.

660
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,546
When will the results come out?

661
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,673
I don't think they'll come out today.

662
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,263
What is that?

663
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,015
It looks like salted pollack roe.

664
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,684
What? Pollack roe?

665
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,646
Or is it a kielbasa sausage?

666
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,486
Jong-muk.

667
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,698
What are you here for now?

668
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,617
I'm here for Ye-bun.

669
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,910
Hello.

670
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,370
Could you give us some privacy?

671
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,913
-Sure.
-Stay.

672
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,668
Are you his captain?
Why are you ordering him around?

673
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,169
Say what you have to say.

674
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,671
Fine.

675
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,673
Then let me ask you one thing.

676
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,758
I heard something about you.

677
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,968
What did you hear?

678
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,429
I heard that I'm the reason…

679
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,765
you never got married.

680
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,269
Stay very still.

681
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:29,315
I'm going to taser
that salted pollack roe into oblivion!

682
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,150
Auntie, just go!

683
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,234
Go!

684
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,152
-Get back here!
-Come on, sir!

685
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,945
-Hey, I said get back here!
-Go!

686
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,574
Ye-bun!

687
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:39,658
Auntie.

688
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,659
Ye-bun!

689
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,371
Who was it that dragged her here?

690
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,914
Who's this?

691
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,041
She's my aunt.

692
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,168
Why don't you just call
your whole extended family

693
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,712
and all the assemblymen in this region
while you're at it?

694
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,297
Hello!

695
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,715
-I'm Assemblyman Cha Ju-man.
-Mr. Cha.

696
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,134
Hello.

697
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,721
Good evening, sir!

698
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,310
I'm Lieutenant Moon Jang-yeol,

699
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,854
an honor graduate from the police academy,
formerly with the RIU

700
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,606
and now at the Mujin Violent Crimes Unit.

701
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,232
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

702
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,111
There must be a misunderstanding here.
Ms. Bong is--

703
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,113
Of course! She wouldn't do such a thing!

704
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,699
Detective Bae, release her right now!

705
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,451
He's not here!

706
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,119
I'll uncuff her.

707
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,714
All right.

708
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,925
-Keep up the good work.
-Thank you, sir.

709
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:38,967
Have a good night.

710
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,607
Hey, get out of their way.

711
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,042
What's with him?

712
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,336
He's definitely going places.

713
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,963
-Detective Na.
-Yes?

714
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,132
Tell him to submit one by tomorrow.

715
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,049
Submit what?

716
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,176
Your specialty, a written apology.

717
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,513
A written apology…

718
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,521
Thank you for the ride.

719
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,607
Ye-bun, I'll see you again.

720
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,984
See you around.

721
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,610
-Get home safely.
-Thanks.

722
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,035
You said I was your only man.

723
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,787
You said that you'd only be with me!

724
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,962
Father, Ju-man is here!

725
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,090
My goodness.

726
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,217
How are you doing, sir?

727
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,303
I arranged everything for you,

728
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,263
so why won't you go to the hospital?

729
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,015
I'm perfectly fine.

730
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,434
You must be busy. You shouldn't have come.

731
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,936
You got injured while helping me.

732
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,021
Of course I had to.

733
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,356
Sorry for the state of the house.

734
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,524
Oh, don't be.

735
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,028
I've always felt at home here
since when Mi-ok was still with us.

736
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,446
I still do.

737
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,294
I didn't know Grandpa could laugh.

738
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:41,381
He's always been fond of Ju-man.

739
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,134
I know. I'm the only person he dislikes.

740
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,930
Why would you put it that way?

741
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,599
Hyeon-ok, bring us some drinks.

742
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,683
Okay!

743
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,562
MISSING WOMAN

744
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,942
OLD MAN WITH ALZHEIMER'S MISSING
FALSE REPORT ON MISSING PERSON

745
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,654
WOMAN ABDUCTED

746
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,989
BOX OFFICE NUMBER 1,
SAVE HIS ABDUCTED DAUGHTER!

747
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,368
WOMAN ABDUCTED IN MUJIN

748
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,410
NO RESULTS

749
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,954
Was what I saw even real?

750
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,872
People are much more confusing.

751
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,341
WRITTEN APOLOGY

752
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:25,759
I'm sorr…

753
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,720
He couldn't even write
two full words all night?

754
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,638
Hey, punk.

755
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,473
Detective Moon!

756
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,059
-Yes, sir?
-Listen.

757
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,937
Can't we just live a quiet life?

758
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,981
All right.

759
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,942
I'll go back to Seoul
as soon as I can for your sake.

760
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,486
I want to send you back to Seoul too.

761
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,113
Then please help me out.

762
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,364
How do I do that?

763
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,450
Help me solve big cases,
improve my performance, and be reinstated.

764
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,499
Then do you think you can solve
this big case I have?

765
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,751
I'll do it no matter what.
What kind of case is it?

766
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,836
Don't freak out.

767
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,505
It's a murder case.

768
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,464
What?

769
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,974
This is the spot.

770
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,521
But the chalk outline of the body
looks a little weird.

771
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,026
How long have you been in Violent Crimes?

772
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,193
It's been two years.

773
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,195
You have a lot to learn.

774
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,531
What's the first thing
a cop should look at in a scene?

775
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,410
Evidence like weapons, prints, or tracks.

776
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,745
Am I wrong?

777
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,039
The first thing you should look at

778
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,248
is the body.

779
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,125
Nothing holds more evidence than the body.

780
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,712
The weapon was definitely a knife.

781
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,880
How do you know?

782
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,299
They probably stabbed the stomach.

783
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,467
And twisted the knife.

784
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,762
Come on,
this outline still seems too small.

785
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,890
This is the work of a professional.

786
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,851
The knife would have damaged the organs.

787
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,103
-Right.
-Then the pain would have been immense.

788
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,940
Your natural instinct when you're in pain
is to curl up from the agony.

789
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:04,858
Right.

790
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,991
Even if there's no body or evidence,
the smell is left behind.

791
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,369
-Get a whiff.
-Okay.

792
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,792
You've probably never smelled this before.

793
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,169
What you just smelled
is the smell of a rotting--

794
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,754
It's the smell of rotting onions.

795
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:33,679
I got lime powder all over the place.

796
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,640
All my onions died.

797
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,183
Just look,

798
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,520
some bastard sprayed pesticides
and killed them all.

799
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,439
So it wasn't a person that died?

800
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,732
Why would a person die?

801
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,109
My onions are the ones that died.

802
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,568
Look here.

803
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,198
I'm spreading lime powder
after pulling out all the dead onions.

804
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,035
Captain.

805
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,995
How is this a murder case?

806
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,250
All those onions were murdered.
Don't come back until you solve that case.

807
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,422
And you said the weapon was a knife?

808
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,971
The story I have for you today

809
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,807
is the Mujin Onion Murder Case

810
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:22,477
that occurred on September 14, 2022.

811
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,023
Why are you putting on that voice?

812
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,191
Your tone is a bit…

813
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,901
This is how they talk on TV.

814
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,028
Should I stop?

815
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,947
No, continue.

816
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,993
In order to talk about the onion incident,

817
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,328
we have to go back a year.

818
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,497
What happened a year ago?

819
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,082
A year ago,

820
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:48,837
I planted something
other than onions in this field.

821
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,797
What did you plant?

822
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,715
I planted…

823
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,259
chili peppers.

824
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,434
All the chili peppers
happened to die then too.

825
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,228
Were they killed by pesticides then too?

826
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,521
No.

827
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:10,233
They died from blight.

828
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,655
After losing my chili peppers to blight,

829
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,450
I ended up planting

830
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,076
chives.

831
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,829
Sir,

832
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,916
when did you actually plant the onions?

833
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,795
This is a story with a narrative arc.

834
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,339
I can’t just skip ahead to the onions.

835
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,884
Then let’s make this short and simple.

836
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,220
Give me the who, what,
when, where, why, and how.

837
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,223
Why would I call you here
if I knew all that?

838
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,349
I could catch him myself.

839
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,811
Fine,

840
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,146
then continue your story from the chives.

841
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,484
When the chives got ruined too,

842
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,486
I finally planted the onions.

843
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,696
Onions. There we go!

844
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,031
And just then!

845
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,992
Lunch is ready.

846
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:07,666
This is all you prepared?
We have guests over!

847
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,418
What's the matter?
I just prepared what we always eat.

848
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,629
This is mortifying.

849
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:15,173
Go butcher the chicken or something!

850
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,468
But our grandson Yeong-cheol
loves that chicken.

851
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,096
You eat chicken, right?

852
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,473
Well, yes…

853
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,434
-I do.
-See?

854
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,603
He says he wants to eat chicken.

855
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,146
No, that's not what I…

856
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,566
No, ma'am…

857
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,410
-I'm so sorry for this.
-It's fine.

858
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,329
What are you doing at 6 a.m. tomorrow?

859
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,372
Why do you ask?

860
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,375
Someone needs to wake us up
since we don't have a rooster anymore.

861
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,794
What's gotten into you, woman?

862
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,839
What are you doing?
Why are you taking that?

863
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,340
Give me back my drumstick!

864
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,137
Why are you just sitting there?
Pick them up.

865
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,849
Pick what up?

866
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,143
He's telling us
to pick up our spoons and dig in.

867
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,396
-Thank you for the meal, sir.
-Sure.

868
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,527
Please, you have the drumstick.

869
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,447
Oh, I eat it all the time.

870
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,241
Is that so? In that case, thank you.

871
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,454
Look how big this is.

872
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,793
How could you just take it for yourself?

873
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,128
He eats it all the time.

874
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,797
That's how much he likes them.

875
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,475
Do you want some chicken porridge too?

876
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,769
There's chicken porridge too?

877
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,145
I'll have a bowl, thank you.

878
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,402
Come on.

879
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:04,074
Learn how to read a room, will you?

880
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,660
What do you mean?
He says there's porridge.

881
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,870
He means we should finish up
and get going now.

882
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,205
Don't be ridiculous.

883
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,082
You just…

884
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,166
You just don't get it.

885
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,753
Thank you.

886
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,422
Detective Moon,
where exactly are you from?

887
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,216
I'm from Seoul…

888
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:23,843
My goodness.

889
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,639
He's asking
who the hell you think you are.

890
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,892
Take your time and enjoy.

891
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,935
Okay, thank you.

892
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,019
Yes, sir.

893
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,813
What now?

894
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,189
He's telling us to get lost.

895
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,194
Why do the folks here
speak in such a roundabout way?

896
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,323
Those are the good ones.

897
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,449
Thank you.

898
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,202
But sir,

899
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,204
do you have anyone you suspect?

900
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,956
Someone who might
hold a grudge against you?

901
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,626
Well, there is one person.

902
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,544
Who is it?

903
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,170
Sang-gu, the pear farmer.

904
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,672
What about him?

905
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:06,261
I mean, he says Boksil
keeps pooping on his pear field.

906
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,347
I just told him that it's good fertilizer.

907
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:14,769
But he got angry
and kept screaming at me to take the poop.

908
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,943
What were you doing three nights ago?

909
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,071
What do you think?
I was packing up my pears.

910
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,491
Is there someone
who can back up your story?

911
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,995
I work alone here,
so who would be able to do that?

912
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,671
Unrelated, but your pears look very fresh.

913
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,839
Of course.

914
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,674
My pears are organic.

915
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,509
You don't even need to wash them.

916
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,012
-Do you want to try one?
-I don't really…

917
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,431
I will. Thank you.

918
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,644
If these are organic,
I guess you don't use pesticides here.

919
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,854
No, of course not.

920
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,774
I take meticulous care growing these.

921
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,193
Then why is your hand like that?

922
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,403
It's as if you've been using pesticides.

923
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,573
What?

924
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,371
Do you just drag people in for no reason?

925
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,706
It's not like that.

926
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,042
You're here because you have reason to be.

927
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,002
You were mad about the dog poop,

928
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,421
so you killed his onions
with pesticides, didn't you?

929
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,341
Did you see me do that?

930
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,594
Your hands are like that
because of the pesticides.

931
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:30,804
Then just…

932
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,680
Just search my home.

933
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,058
If I did it, I would have some pesticides.

934
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,894
I'll comply without a fuss
if you find any.

935
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,895
All right.

936
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,231
Then I'll go bring the pesticides.

937
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,498
There's nothing here.

938
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,125
He sounded really confident.

939
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,543
What if he's not the culprit?

940
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,610
Oh, my.

941
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,987
Hello.

942
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,658
Hello.

943
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,955
Oh, right.

944
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,624
You told me that you worked here.

945
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,835
How is your cat doing?

946
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,379
I was actually meaning
to go see you again.

947
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:47,922
Me?

948
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:49,632
Why?

949
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,719
I came across another cat
while I was on a walk.

950
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,263
It seemed abandoned too.

951
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,098
It went in between
some discarded materials

952
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,516
and refused to come back out.

953
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,060
There's no way to even feed it.

954
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,645
Really?

955
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,023
Should I go check it out?

956
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,775
My shift is actually about to end.

957
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,818
I'll go with you.

958
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,778
With me?

959
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,615
Together?

960
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,838
Hey, perv.

961
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,674
Where are you taking this guy?

962
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,594
I think you have the wrong person.

963
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,805
Your name is Bong Ye-bun,
and you're a 35-year-old vet.

964
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,224
Your previous convictions…

965
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,392
Oh my, Detective Moon?

966
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,769
Hello.

967
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,813
Long time no see, Deok-hee.
Detective Na, nice to see you as well.

968
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,856
We saw you yesterday.

969
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,027
So good to see you all!

970
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,196
You must all be busy,
so please go on your way.

971
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,864
Bye. We can go this way.

972
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,407
Excuse me.

973
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,244
Make sure to keep your butt safe.

974
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,328
I'm sorry?

975
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,211
What did he mean by that?

976
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,797
Toxic grass.

977
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,175
He was telling you to watch out
for toxic grass when you sit down.

978
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,804
Kitty.

979
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,389
Kitty?

980
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,850
You see the cat in there, right?

981
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,894
Yes, I see it.

982
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,854
I can't get it to come out.

983
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,450
Here, kitty.

984
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,704
Come here, sweetie.

985
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,705
It's coming out.

986
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:47,834
You're amazing.

987
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,711
This is nothing.

988
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,138
Dr. Bong saved you.

989
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:02,932
Say thank you.

990
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,893
Oh, no need to…

991
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:24,287
I'll give it a bath
and bring it tomorrow for a checkup.

992
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,623
Will you be open tomorrow?

993
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,832
Yes, of course.

994
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,210
Our hospital is open
every day of the year.

995
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,796
I'll see you tomorrow.

996
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,471
Explain yourself.

997
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,807
Well, he's just one of our clients.

998
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:45,767
Not that.

999
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,477
Explain those noodles.

1000
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,690
You got blinded by some guy

1001
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,318
that you forgot your bestie's parents
run a supermarket?

1002
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,196
Should I help you remember?

1003
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:01,282
No, Ok-hui. This will never happen again.

1004
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,661
Ye-bun.

1005
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,415
Loyalty…

1006
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,793
maketh…

1007
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,544
man.

1008
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,340
Since you already bought it, enjoy it.

1009
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,717
No, I'm not going to enjoy it.

1010
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,990
So when are you going to let me go?

1011
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,033
Well…

1012
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:44,951
Hey,

1013
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,663
don't we have to legally let him go?

1014
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,498
How much do you trust me, sir?

1015
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:52,166
Not a bit.

1016
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,502
Then just keep him there
for one more hour.

1017
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,004
-I'll come back with evidence.
-I said I don't trust…

1018
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,674
Why, that little…

1019
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,647
You little…

1020
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,818
Why are you digging like a dog
in the middle of the night?

1021
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,779
I had my reasons!

1022
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,655
And why are you here?

1023
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,950
What was it?

1024
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,452
What the hell were you digging…

1025
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:12,997
PESTICIDES

1026
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,254
What is this?

1027
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,137
Tell me.

1028
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,229
How did you know
those pesticides were buried there?

1029
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,607
Like you'll believe me
if I tell you the truth.

1030
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,527
I will, so just tell me.

1031
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,532
I told you. I'm psychic.

1032
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,325
I can see everything
when I touch someone's butt.

1033
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,245
That's why I touched
that pickpocket's butt last time.

1034
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,121
Why, you little…

1035
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,039
See?

1036
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,209
You don't believe me.

1037
01:03:58,292 --> 01:03:59,961
Why'd you even ask?

1038
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:03,548
I've experienced
too many weird things in this town.

1039
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,466
And you trump them all.

1040
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,136
I'm telling you the truth.
How should I prove it to you?

1041
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,596
Enough with the crap.

1042
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,933
Leave by the time I count to three,
or I'll arrest you as an accomplice.

1043
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,520
One, two, three.

1044
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,193
I'm not sure who's the crazy one,
me or her.

1045
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,286
Hey, that cop that lives on your roof
is a total lunatic.

1046
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,205
Did you just realize that?
I knew the minute I saw him.

1047
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,253
Hey,

1048
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:43,462
what is this?

1049
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,714
What? My butt padding?

1050
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,052
-What the hell?
-Why can't I see anything?

1051
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,929
Ok-hui, excuse me for a second.

1052
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,515
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

1053
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,271
Did you smash a streetlight?

1054
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,356
How did you know that?

1055
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,443
-And you kissed someone?
-What the hell? How?

1056
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,945
So this is all for real?

1057
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,367
You said I was your only man.

1058
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,119
You said that you'd only be with me!

1059
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:20,041
So that was real too?

1060
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:39,161
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

1061
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,496
Excuse me!

1062
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,622
It’s a kidnapping case.

1063
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,540
You saw this yourself?

1064
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,750
I told you. I'm psychic.

1065
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:47,545
I said, get lost!

1066
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,590
Check if there is a streamer
among the people reported missing.

1067
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,509
It's nice and close.

1068
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,428
There’s someone at the hospital.
Go downstairs.

1069
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,887
I envy Seon-woo's cat.

1070
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,723
I bet it gets to see everything.

1071
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,474
Are you introducing me
to another boyfriend?

1072
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,851
Why isn’t he here?

1073
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,644
You're going to regret it
if you don't believe me.

1074
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,188
For the sake of our 20-year friendship.

1075
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,025
Forget it. Just stay out of my sight.

1076
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,360
Call me when that girl is at his house.

1077
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,611
I’ll believe you then.

1078
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,280
Hurry up, let's go.

1079
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:16,699
I'm counting on you to come,
so I'm going in first.

1080
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,952
I want to trust you, Detective.

1081
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:27,960
