1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,132
You're Jong-hyeok from vet school!

3
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,384
Ye-bun, did you come here
without knowing what this place is?

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,636
You said that you'd only be with me!

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,098
So that was real too?

6
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,144
Ye-bun, I'll see you again.

7
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,359
Excuse me!

8
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,820
Detective Moon!

9
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,407
What? What's wrong?

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,577
What's going on?

11
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,218
Jeez, I got scared for nothing.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,136
This isn't what's important right now.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,805
It is to me.

14
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:41,810
Get it out of here, will you?

15
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,229
No.

16
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,772
No.

17
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,066
No!

18
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,901
No!

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,201
Gosh.

20
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,871
This is killing me.

21
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,917
You're allergic to cats?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,003
I'm allergic to any animal with fur.

23
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,547
But most of all,

24
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,134
I'm allergic to perverts.

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,512
-So leave.
-I'm not here because I want to be.

26
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,348
-I have something to tell you.
-I'm not interested, so leave.

27
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,309
I'll keep it short.
It's a kidnapping case.

28
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,312
When I got arrested
for drugs the other day…

29
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,564
I mean…

30
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,357
When you mistakenly arrested me
the other day,

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,609
you also arrested my college friend.

32
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,863
I think he kidnapped someone.

33
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,905
What?

34
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,325
I saw a woman tied up,
begging for her life.

35
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,411
-You saw this yourself?
-Yes.

36
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,537
Where is she?

37
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,582
I don't know.

38
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,876
-You said you saw it yourself.
-I told you.

39
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,295
I'm psychic.

40
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,797
Get out of here.

41
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,716
A woman really got kidnapped!

42
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,010
If you don't believe me,
look into it yourself.

43
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,262
I'm sure she's been reported missing.

44
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,347
She's in her twenties
with long permed hair…

45
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,641
What else?

46
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,060
You said that you'd only be with me!

47
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,396
Dance like when you get donations.

48
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,440
100,000 won should be enough
for a "Heart Two."

49
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,320
She seems to be an online streamer.

50
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,237
So what?

51
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,991
Do you expect me to start an investigation
based on your psychic nonsense?

52
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,784
A person might die.

53
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,245
I'm on the verge of death myself.

54
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,080
Leave.

55
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,290
I'm telling the truth.

56
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,083
You have to believe me.

57
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,377
I don't believe people easily.

58
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,588
Especially a perv like you.

59
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,715
-Get out.
-But it's true!

60
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,593
-Please believe me, Detective!
-Just go.

61
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,069
A person might die.

62
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,327
He's a total nutjob.

63
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,371
Why won't he believe me?

64
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,128
You're already back from Australia?

65
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,132
I had a great time with my kid
thanks to you.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,343
But why are you back so soon?

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,220
Things are expensive there.

68
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,138
And I was jet-lagged and bored.

69
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,016
This is for you.

70
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,226
A little souvenir.

71
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,561
They sell this at Ok-hui's too.

72
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,356
I bought it in Australia.

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
Look what it says here.

74
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,276
"Austria Dirty Hoodie."

75
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,611
By the way,

76
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,446
I can now see people's memories too.

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,447
Really?

78
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,242
Then you'd make a great shaman.

79
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,077
But nobody believes me.

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,912
In our line of work,

81
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,206
you don't just hope
someone will believe you.

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,499
You make them believe.

83
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,251
How do I do that?

84
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,837
Look at me.

85
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
"I'm not sure,

86
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,175
but I think you need to become a shaman."

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,929
-Did that sound believable?
-No.

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,264
Right? How about this?

89
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,182
"You…

90
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,935
should definitely become a shaman."

91
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,687
Then most will answer,

92
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,106
"Me? That's not right."

93
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,524
That's when you say,

94
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,944
"Something's going on
that you're not aware of."

95
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,408
What about now?

96
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm a bit scared,

97
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,202
but I believe you.

98
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,912
Right?

99
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,083
You have to sound so confident
that it's almost scary.

100
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,461
That's how you get others to believe you.

101
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,640
What is it now?

102
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,102
I'm psychic.

103
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,896
You've finally lost it.

104
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,523
Something's going on
that you're not aware of!

105
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,780
I said, get lost!

106
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,286
FEMALE STREAMERS

107
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,672
How are you, Mi-jeong?

108
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,384
I'm calling to ask about Yeom Jong-hyeok.

109
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,053
He was in your year.

110
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,806
-Are you close with him?
-No.

111
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,973
He was a loner.

112
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,851
So he didn't fit in at school
and wasn't close with any of us.

113
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,522
Then I guess you don't know
where he lives?

114
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,439
I don't.

115
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,691
Is there anyone who might know?

116
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,860
But didn't you say
that you'd set up a hospital in Seoul?

117
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,987
I'm just working at a friend's hospital.

118
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,910
Do you know anyone from our school
who opened an animal hospital near Mujin?

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,455
I was surprised to hear from you.

120
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,957
What is this about?

121
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,709
I heard you work near Mujin

122
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,294
but I never got to see you.

123
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,380
So I wanted to say hi and catch up.

124
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,466
Your hospital's also around here, right?

125
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,884
Yes.

126
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,844
How's it doing?

127
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,888
I mostly treat livestock
since it's the countryside.

128
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,849
Same here.

129
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,309
By the way,

130
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,813
I heard that Jong-hyeok works under you.

131
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,941
Yes, he actually mentioned
that he saw you.

132
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,900
Did he?

133
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,653
What is he doing now?

134
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,198
It's his day off, so he's probably home.

135
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,493
Does he live around here?

136
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,174
Hello?

137
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,675
Hey, Jong-hyeok.

138
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,926
It's me, Ye-bun.

139
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,220
Hi. What's up?

140
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:55,141
I just thought
we didn't get to talk much that day.

141
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,188
But what's with all the noise at your end?

142
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,731
I'm outside.

143
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,399
I had errands to run.

144
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,317
You did?

145
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,651
That's great.

146
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,070
Sorry? What do you mean?

147
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,617
Walking around outside
is good for your health.

148
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,118
So I'm glad.

149
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,454
So what exactly are you doing out?

150
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,414
Are you shopping?

151
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,000
Or are you on a date?

152
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,710
Do you have a girl--

153
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,961
Oh, my gosh!

154
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,546
Ye-bun.

155
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,507
You were here?

156
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,720
Surprise.

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,769
What brings you to my place?

158
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,230
I met with Eun-seok.

159
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,525
And when he said he works with you,
I wanted to surprise you.

160
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:46,943
I see.

161
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,320
You really surprised me.

162
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,530
Did I?

163
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,447
Yes.

164
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:56,536
By the way, your house
seemed very well-maintained.

165
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,746
Do you live with someone?

166
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,082
No, I live alone.

167
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,084
I see.

168
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,461
How long have you been living alone?

169
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,463
It's been quite a while.

170
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,675
Then you must not have had
a home-cooked meal in ages.

171
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,426
Not many men cook at home.

172
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,262
I guess.

173
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,138
Since I'm here,

174
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,682
should I cook for you?

175
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,225
No, thanks.

176
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,352
I don't even have
cooking utensils at home.

177
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,521
How about you buy me a meal instead?

178
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,524
Would that be better?

179
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,692
Yes.

180
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,949
Thank you for coming.

181
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,536
Thank you.

182
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,917
I'll know for sure
if I touch it one more time.

183
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,685
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,061
I tripped.

185
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,021
I'm so sorry.

186
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,115
With great power comes great hair loss.

187
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,160
This is driving me nuts.

188
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,179
What do you watch on MeTube these days?

189
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,097
Excuse me?

190
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,185
All the contents seem too generic.
Do you have any recommendations?

191
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,979
I don't really watch a lot of videos.

192
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,856
I see.

193
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,529
Aren't you going to eat?

194
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,948
I am.

195
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,039
Which streamer
is the most popular these days?

196
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,583
-Sea squirt…
-Is that the name of a streamer?

197
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,045
Hot!

198
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,300
I did it because…

199
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,469
You know…

200
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,678
I know.

201
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,639
I know what you mean.

202
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,642
Since I was a bit, you know…

203
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:30,272
I'll do the, you know,
and all the, you know, from now on.

204
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,357
What?

205
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,527
You don't have to do all that.

206
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,779
Just do the, you know.

207
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,448
No, I insist.

208
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,158
I said, there's no need.

209
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,661
Why do you say that when I was…

210
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,121
You know…

211
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,748
Do as I say, or you know what I'll do!

212
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,335
They don't seem to be coming
to an agreement.

213
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,174
What are you talking about?
They just made up.

214
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,676
What?

215
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,969
When?

216
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,179
They just said that they'd, you know.

217
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,434
Don't cry.

218
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,189
Welcome.

219
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,650
I need some allergy pills.

220
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,734
I'll take this.

221
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,695
That one?

222
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,113
I'd recommend…

223
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,408
this one instead.

224
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,619
No, that one works well on me.
So I'll take that.

225
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,579
Goodness.

226
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,248
Guess how many people with allergies
I've helped so far.

227
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,960
He means that one
gets him a bigger profit.

228
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,632
I'm fine with my usual.

229
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,637
I guess the kids
must be out of school by now.

230
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,890
He's struggling
to put his kid through school.

231
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,725
All right.

232
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,645
So this is what you want?

233
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,647
He's calling you heartless.

234
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,232
You're making this up, aren't you?

235
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,192
No, I'm not.

236
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,990
I'll have whatever you give me.

237
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,077
Where did you park?

238
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,829
He says thank you.

239
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,462
I don't think I belong in this town.

240
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,589
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

241
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,176
I'm fine, but I want you
to look into something for me.

242
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,135
What is it?

243
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,970
Check if there is a streamer

244
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,015
in her mid-twenties with long permed hair

245
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,434
among the people reported missing.

246
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,812
With the drug case too,
where are you getting all this intel?

247
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
Never mind. Don't look into it.

248
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,835
I seriously can't understand
people from Seoul.

249
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,131
Should I look into
the missing person case?

250
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,341
Forget about it.

251
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,553
-What's going on?
-Let's go!

252
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,929
What is this about?

253
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,056
Detectives should move faster
than they speak.

254
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,521
DAOM MOTEL

255
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,443
What is it? Prostitution? Drugs?

256
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,123
-You bastard!
-What the…

257
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,960
Spill it, you asshole!

258
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,795
Spill what?

259
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,589
What does he have to spill?

260
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,132
Help me, honey.

261
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,133
"Honey"?

262
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,093
What? Why did you stop?

263
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,262
-Honey.
-Move.

264
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,597
You cheating bastard.

265
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,433
How much longer
do I have to put up with this?

266
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,435
-Who is it this time?
-Please.

267
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,477
A waitress? A friend?

268
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,439
Did you meet her while golfing?
Or while selling insurance?

269
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,482
Maybe it was the hiking club this time.

270
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,860
-Or did you use a dating app?
-No.

271
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,238
Where is she?
Where did you hide her, you little…

272
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,489
Honey.

273
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,658
I'm really here by myself, all right?

274
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm here for a hotel staycation.

275
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,038
-More like a motel staycation.
-Exactly.

276
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,165
Look around.
There's nobody else here but me.

277
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,333
You expect me to believe that?

278
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,006
Honey.

279
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,053
Hi.

280
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,931
You keep dispatching the SWAT team,

281
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,433
running license and background checks,
and even ordering stakeouts.

282
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,480
You can't exercise police authority
to catch your husband having affairs.

283
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,065
That's illegal surveillance.

284
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,734
I DEEPLY APOLOGIZE, BUT I HAVE NO REGRETS…

285
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,699
Churning out written apologies
must be a piece of cake for you by now.

286
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,786
If you put all of them together,

287
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,372
it'd be at least a dozen books.

288
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,459
And they're always so fun to read.

289
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,841
I've never seen
such a moving written apology.

290
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,386
What's that? "I wanted to be worshipped."

291
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,639
"The ten seconds it takes me
to cuff my player of a husband…"

292
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,182
The way I see it…

293
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,726
You know Park Hae-young,
who wrote My Liberation Notes?

294
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,063
I think you're a better writer than her.

295
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,940
Jeez.

296
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,861
And what we have over here is a gangster.

297
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,031
We have a gangster and a great writer
in the same room.

298
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,827
What are you then?

299
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,330
Forget it.

300
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,708
-Hey, Ms. Park Hae-young.
-Yes?

301
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,293
Find him a fitting character, all right?

302
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,722
Are you going somewhere?

303
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,850
You should get some more rest.
You're unwell.

304
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,395
Where are you going?

305
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,357
He's probably going to Ju-man again.

306
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,445
-Where are the groceries?
-Oh, yeah.

307
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,073
There’s someone at the hospital.
Go downstairs.

308
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,617
I told you not to set up any appointments.

309
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,119
He said you told him to come.

310
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,162
Who is it?

311
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,955
Mr. Porcelain from the convenience store.

312
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,543
Have you been waiting long?

313
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,336
Not at all.

314
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,174
You've become even prettier
after meeting an amazing owner.

315
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,550
It won't eat.

316
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,053
Yesterday, it threw up
and cried all night.

317
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:39,141
You know how some people
can't sleep in unfamiliar environments?

318
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,601
The same goes for animals.

319
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,436
It must be a sensitive one.

320
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,066
I'll give it the first round of vaccines.

321
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,548
My hair.

322
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,554
I'm done taking a shower.

323
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,056
I'll feed you in a second.

324
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,000
My neck is cramping up.

325
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:49,920
See you next time.

326
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,421
Okay, bye.

327
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,422
Bye.

328
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:08,897
Meowie,

329
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,483
I envy Seon-woo's cat.

330
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,569
I bet it gets to see everything.

331
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,283
Why didn't I think of that?

332
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,995
Where are you off to now?

333
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,080
Don't forget to buy groceries this time!

334
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,499
MUJIN MEDICAL CENTER

335
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,253
Mr. Jung Ui-hwan.

336
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,092
NEUROSURGERY

337
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,178
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man.

338
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,597
I'll make our beautiful Mujin
a city bustling with tourists.

339
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,432
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man.

340
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,601
Hello, I'm Cha Ju-man.

341
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,603
I'm candidate number one, Cha Ju-man.

342
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,564
You're here, sir. I'll do that.

343
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,195
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm a bit late.

345
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,283
Are you all right? You look unwell.

346
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,326
I'm fine.

347
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,786
I'm perfectly fine.

348
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,747
Get him something cool to drink.

349
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,789
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,586
Hello, have a good day.

351
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,631
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man.

352
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm your number one, Cha Ju-man!

353
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,477
Hey, kitty.

354
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,103
Meow.

355
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,899
Come here, kitty.

356
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,138
I need you guys to help me out here.

357
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm putting my hair on the line for this.

358
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,185
I'm just going to touch you for a bit.

359
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,819
Show me a little more.

360
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,153
You got this.

361
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,867
What are you doing here again?

362
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,885
I remember that chair.

363
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,138
Please let me go!

364
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,723
I'm sorry!

365
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,474
You said that you'd only be with me!

366
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,353
What the heck?

367
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,780
I almost had it.

368
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,628
Come here, kitty.

369
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,213
Get inside this box.

370
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,716
That's it. Come here, kitty.

371
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,845
Come on. Get in here.

372
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,724
Meow.

373
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,112
Ye-bun! Why aren't you here yet?

374
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,703
That brat probably forgot
to buy groceries again.

375
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,789
God knows what she's up to.

376
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,715
Why is he drinking alone?

377
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,592
The poor thing.

378
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,851
Why are you drinking alone?

379
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,770
I'm not drinking yet.

380
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,077
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

381
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,414
Maybe it's been too long since I drank.

382
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,582
I feel dizzy.

383
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,254
Stop playing tricks and get up.

384
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,259
What on earth are you doing?

385
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,053
Why do you have to show up
and stir my heart

386
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,429
when I've moved on?

387
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,600
Go. I don't want to see you.

388
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,438
You really want me to go?

389
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,940
Go now.

390
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,611
You have no idea how I feel.

391
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,376
Goodness me.

392
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,628
I don't feel like drinking anymore.

393
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,097
Why does it have to rain right now?

394
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,447
Get in.

395
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,204
This doesn't mean anything.

396
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,039
It's because of the rain.

397
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,167
I would have done this for anyone.

398
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,461
I didn't say anything.

399
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,760
Do you want to listen to some music?

400
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,720
It's broken. Don't touch it.

401
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,014
We're not people who enjoy music together.

402
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,140
So just forget it.

403
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,816
It's hot.

404
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,904
Damn it!

405
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,323
This doesn't close because it's broken!

406
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,951
What's wrong with you?

407
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,661
This is good!

408
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,121
It's a chance for us to be happy together!

409
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,249
I love being in the rain!

410
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,252
Are you out of your mind?

411
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,715
Oh, come on.

412
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm happy!

413
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,806
Only lunatics would do this in the rain!

414
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,808
I'm happy!

415
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,026
Would you believe me if I told you
you're the reason I got divorced?

416
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,447
Everyone knows it was
because you got scammed out of money.

417
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,824
Get out.

418
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,417
Even so,

419
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,545
no one has loved me more than you did.

420
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,923
And you're someone I'll regret losing
for the rest of my life.

421
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,050
So Jong-muk…

422
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,890
Worship me.

423
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,478
My goodness.

424
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,897
I just can't with you.

425
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,233
You're so adorable when you laugh.

426
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,652
Laugh like that
to the people that come to you.

427
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,821
Welcome me like that.

428
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,241
Oh, for crying out loud.

429
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,993
Goodness, gracious.

430
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,296
What's going on?

431
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,342
Didn't I tell you to dress up like a vet?

432
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,010
Are you introducing me
to another boyfriend?

433
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,261
What do you mean, "another"?

434
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,473
He told me his house passcode yesterday
and now wants to meet my friends.

435
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,142
Which means he wants to marry me.

436
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,311
You wanted to marry a French man.

437
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,564
From now on,
only introduce French men to me.

438
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,524
I don't have time for this right now.

439
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,070
So you're leaving?

440
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,822
No.

441
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,325
I just wanted to meet him
in a more formal way.

442
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,743
You know what to do, right?

443
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,038
I am to make it clear
that I'm a vet with a college degree.

444
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,124
And carefully make up
meticulous stories about your past.

445
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,294
In moderation.
Don't take it too far, okay?

446
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,587
Okay.

447
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,175
Ye-bun.

448
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,387
Today, you'll be seeing a side of me
that you've never seen before.

449
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,722
But don't be startled or flustered.

450
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,392
And don't even think about
making fun of me. Got it?

451
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,520
So where's your boyfriend?

452
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,147
-Why isn’t he here?
-He's busy closing up.

453
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,357
Closing up?

454
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,983
He works here.

455
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,568
He owns this place.

456
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,529
What?

457
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,212
Honey.

458
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,257
This is Ok-hui's best friend, Ye-bun.

459
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,635
Hello.

460
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,304
Hello.

461
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,432
I'm Bong Ye-bun.

462
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,684
I studied veterinary medicine
at Hana University

463
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,102
and now run an animal hospital.

464
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,228
I see.

465
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,940
She's called Ye-bun
because she's pretty like a bunny.

466
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,819
But Ok-hui's the prettiest bunny
in your eyes, right?

467
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,363
Of course.

468
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,575
Ok-hui told me a lot about you.

469
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,578
But haven't we met before?

470
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,579
Sorry?

471
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,498
I'm not sure. I don't remember seeing you.

472
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,628
You think so because she's plain-looking.

473
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,298
Have you eaten yet?

474
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,425
If not, would you like a sandwich?

475
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,761
We're famous for our sandwiches.

476
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,803
Sure.

477
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,807
Yes, please.

478
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,518
Ye-bun wants a sandwich.

479
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,772
Okay, just a second.

480
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,064
I'll be right back.

481
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,529
I told you not to make fun of me.

482
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,740
I'm not making fun of you.

483
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,577
I just think that garter belts
and long wigs are a bit too much.

484
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,745
What garter belt?

485
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,831
You wore them to please him, didn't you?

486
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,500
Are you insane? That's gross.

487
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,502
Also, I've never had long hair in my life

488
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,796
whether it's mine or a wig.

489
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,631
It's a disadvantage when I fight.

490
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,257
This, I can just take off.

491
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,475
Ok-hui.

492
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,311
Please don't get hurt.

493
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,771
What is it?

494
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,107
Should I tell you?

495
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,318
What is it? Tell me.

496
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,823
Hurry up and say it.

497
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,912
Come on. Tell me.

498
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,374
I think your boyfriend
is seeing another woman.

499
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,291
How do you know?

500
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,545
I'm 100% sure of it. You should check.

501
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,463
Did you see or hear something?
How do you know?

502
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,299
Something's going on
that you're not aware of.

503
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,600
Oh, my back.

504
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:26,926
Meow.

505
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,011
Come here, kitty.

506
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,512
Meow.

507
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,321
This was expensive.

508
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:51,868
Come here, kitty.

509
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,579
Here, kitty.

510
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,874
There you go.

511
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,287
What's all this?

512
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
This chair…

513
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,510
So she really was a MeTuber.

514
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,472
But why are these in Jong-hyeok's house?

515
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,271
Where is she?

516
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,399
Did something happen to her already?

517
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,401
Hello?

518
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,946
Can you hear me?

519
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,576
Give me a signal if you can.

520
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,088
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

521
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,512
That little perv.

522
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,931
She's walking around
wearing a windowsill now?

523
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,851
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

524
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,394
Hey, you.

525
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,442
What is this?

526
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,487
I almost died today
because you didn't believe me!

527
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,865
How could I believe you
when you pull stunts like this?

528
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,202
Why, that little…

529
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,708
Can you get me out of this thing?

530
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,463
Right. No matter how perverted you are,

531
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,381
you probably can't go home like this.

532
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,678
Watch out.

533
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,305
You're such a wuss.

534
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,182
-I won't hurt you.
-Not me.

535
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,350
My bag.

536
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,977
I'm not done paying for it yet.

537
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,939
You're really something else.

538
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,907
I guess you'll get married twice
since you have a double crown.

539
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,824
Leave.

540
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,701
-Just go.
-I'll be quiet.

541
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,260
Why won't you believe me?

542
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,139
I told you the truth
risking being called insane.

543
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,811
I never told anyone else that I'm psychic.

544
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,145
I only told you.

545
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,898
Why did you only tell me?

546
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,277
I thought you'd believe me.

547
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,868
You let that man go
because you trust people.

548
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,418
You wavered because you trusted him.

549
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,087
Who told you that?

550
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,006
Nobody told me.

551
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,090
I saw it.

552
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,427
Say another word,

553
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,637
and I'll make you regret it.

554
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,809
If you trust me like you trusted him…

555
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,272
Get lost.

556
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,917
Here's 20,000 won.

557
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,548
I don't want to owe you anything.

558
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,430
You're dead if it costs
more than 20,000 won.

559
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,851
-Hello, sir.
-Hey, Deok-hee.

560
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,021
Find out how much it costs
to get a windowsill off a person's body.

561
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,356
Excuse me?

562
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,775
All right, sir.

563
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,151
Okay.

564
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,363
He's definitely not normal.

565
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,826
And neither is she.

566
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,083
All right.

567
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,543
Thank you for showing up today too.

568
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,170
-Yeong-hui.
-Yes, sis.

569
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,798
So you got into a huge fight
with your mother-in-law?

570
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,591
-That's right.
-How did it end?

571
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,302
We got hammered together
and became best friends.

572
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,261
What a family.

573
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,180
Were you at the plastic surgeon's?

574
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,473
Yes, sis.

575
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,475
Here.

576
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,519
Make it sharper.

577
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,479
-How's your salon doing?
-Good, sis.

578
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,647
Who's this?

579
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,774
She came with me
because I needed to finish her perm.

580
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,900
How professional.

581
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,069
My goodness.

582
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,737
Why are you here again?

583
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,825
Da-eun was changing the baby's diaper
when she saw your text.

584
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,994
And she insisted
that at least I should be here.

585
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,788
-Tell her it's fine.
-Wait.

586
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,082
It felt like

587
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,000
I might be the one

588
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,004
to need diapers if I didn't come here.

589
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,841
So I gladly showed up, sis.

590
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,634
She's taking this a little too far.

591
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,677
Just go.

592
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,346
I must tell her what this is about, sis.

593
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,764
Stop calling me that!

594
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,435
All right, girls.

595
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,812
The reason I called you here is…

596
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:41,730
Take a good look.

597
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
This is my boyfriend.

598
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:50,406
Report to me about every single woman
he meets aside from me. Got it?

599
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,532
-Yes, sis!
-Yes, sis!

600
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,825
You're dismissed.

601
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,121
Why are you still here?

602
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,081
My eyes are aging.

603
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,751
Can I take a closer look at your phone?

604
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,549
I got it, sis.

605
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,719
I said stop calling me that!

606
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:24,190
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY GRADUATE
ENGLISH TUTOR

607
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,873
-I'm…
-Quiet!

608
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,044
General MacArthur is landing in Mujin.

609
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,180
It's Kim Seon-woo.

610
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,850
November 28.

611
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,479
You're pretty good at English.

612
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,148
Okay then.

613
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,691
What brings you here?

614
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,402
I'm here to teach you English.

615
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,280
My goodness.

616
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,240
Hello, sir.

617
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,910
Is it all right if I sit here?

618
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,079
The teacher should take the seat of honor.

619
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,667
Why don't we test your English level
before we start?

620
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,210
Test my English level?

621
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,254
What's the seventh month in English?

622
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,423
The seventh month?

623
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,637
January, February, March

624
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,848
April, May, June

625
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,976
July…

626
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,353
July, right?

627
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,312
That'll do then.

628
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,647
The test is over.

629
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,899
Shouldn't you ask me more questions?

630
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,693
I think that's all I need.

631
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,362
You're better at reading people than I am.

632
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:54,989
By the way,

633
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,116
are you looking for a tenant?

634
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,867
Yes, I am.

635
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,494
That's good.

636
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,621
I was actually
looking for a place to rent.

637
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,456
This place is too shabby.

638
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,418
How about we don't
pay each other rent or tuition?

639
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,214
Then I'll be in your care.

640
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,592
That would be my line.

641
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,677
When will you be moving in?

642
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,012
Would tomorrow be okay?

643
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,180
Tomorrow? That soon?

644
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,349
Yes. The sooner the better.

645
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,024
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

646
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,192
It's nice…

647
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:34,820
and close.

648
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,576
METUBE TV

649
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,799
Oh, hello.

650
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,968
Hello, Dr. Bong.

651
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,682
What are you doing?

652
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,893
I'm going to live around here from today.

653
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,520
We'll be seeing each other more often.

654
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,357
Okay.

655
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,484
We'll see each other very often.

656
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,070
Bye.

657
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,747
I'll move in the rest. Head inside.

658
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,918
Did you pull another scam?

659
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,252
It's not a scam.

660
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,255
He's going to be my English tutor.

661
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,424
In return, he pays no rent.

662
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,426
English tutor?

663
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,389
He majored in English
at Hankook University.

664
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,350
That suits him.

665
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,729
But you said MacArthur returned to the US.
What kind of scam are you planning?

666
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,689
The thing is,

667
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,233
my son moved to Australia
at such a young age

668
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,943
that he doesn't speak Korean.

669
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,529
So I didn't get to talk to him
during my last visit.

670
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,907
I don't even know what he likes.

671
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,827
I see.

672
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,954
But I can't just give up.

673
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:10,124
I'm going to try every possible way

674
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,418
to communicate with him.

675
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,920
I'm sorry for doubting you.

676
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:15,838
No.

677
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,841
You have every right to do so.

678
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,051
Well then.

679
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,892
THE HOLY BIBLE, CHURCH HYMNAL

680
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,852
This is bad.

681
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,396
God and the general
don't mix well together.

682
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,738
-Come with me.
-Why?

683
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:49,121
You know how well-connected
and tenacious I am, right?

684
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,081
And that there's nothing I can't find out.

685
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,666
Yes.

686
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,627
I asked around everywhere,
and my boyfriend has no other woman.

687
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,172
I even asked him myself.

688
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,090
Why did you say that to me?

689
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,427
I can't…

690
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,679
tell you why.

691
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:09,183
But you're going to regret it
if you don't believe me.

692
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,517
So trust me.

693
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,438
I'll be very sad
if you don't trust me either.

694
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,231
I want to believe you!

695
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,108
But there's no other woman.

696
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,568
If you keep this up,

697
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:22,112
I'll just have to assume
that you're being jealous.

698
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,489
It's not like that.

699
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,491
I told you that
because I was worried about you.

700
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,701
If you're that sure, find the woman.

701
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,495
Then I'll believe you.

702
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,539
If you're right,
I'll even kneel at your feet.

703
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,041
But if you're not?

704
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,876
Then you and I are done.

705
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,635
This damn psychometry
or whatever it's called.

706
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,428
It's only making my life complicated.

707
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,686
Ye-bun.

708
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
Hello.

709
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,897
Hi.

710
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,483
I was in the area,
so I stopped by for some coffee.

711
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,735
I see. Do you need anything else?

712
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,448
I'm actually here because of Ok-hui.

713
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,244
Is Ok-hui all right? What is this about?

714
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,959
First, let me fill your glass.

715
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,089
How much can you drink?

716
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,633
I can drink about three glasses of soju.

717
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,686
Please tell me what this is about.
I'm dying to know.

718
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,813
-You are, aren't you?
-I am.

719
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,940
Here. Have another shot.

720
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,276
Why do you keep giving me shots?

721
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,821
You won't be able to handle
what I'm about to say if you're sober.

722
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,660
What on earth is going on?

723
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,953
Is there another man?

724
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,290
Have another shot.

725
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,876
There isn't necessarily
another man involved--

726
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,919
Then?

727
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,797
Does it have to do with her finances?

728
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,092
Have another shot.

729
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,690
Have you seen this person around?

730
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,150
I don't think so.

731
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,736
Please call
Mujin Police Station if you do.

732
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,030
Have you seen this person around?

733
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,948
I'm not sure.

734
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,450
I don't think so.

735
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,420
Honey, are you all right?

736
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,257
I knew you were drinking too fast.

737
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,426
Honey.

738
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,721
Why are your shoulders so stiff?

739
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,141
Hold still. I'll give you a massage.

740
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,060
Gosh, you're so stiff.

741
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,687
Your back is full of knots.

742
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,476
Where do you live?

743
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,688
Hey, where do you live?

744
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,109
How did I get myself into this?

745
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,532
-Excuse me.
-They left the restaurant

746
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,991
and are heading toward the motels.

747
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,619
I won't miss them, sis.

748
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,162
Have you seen this person around?

749
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,249
-I'm not sure.
-Please call the station if you see him.

750
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,583
-All right.
-Thank you.

751
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,501
Sure.

752
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,425
That little perv…

753
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
GARNET MOTEL

754
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,439
-What are you doing here?
-Chasing a pervert. You?

755
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,316
-Chasing my boyfriend.
-Let's go.

756
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,328
I can explain everything.

757
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,043
Hurry up and arrest me.
She's going to kill me.

758
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,004
Come on. Drag me out.

759
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,343
How could you steal my boyfriend?

760
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,678
It's not like that.

761
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,722
Then explain what I saw earlier.

762
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,016
Forget it.

763
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,185
Just stay out of my sight.

764
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,645
Or I'll make you regret it.

765
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,147
Ok-hui.

766
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,692
You were the only reason why
I was able to stand being here

767
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:12,110
after my parents passed away.

768
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,614
You were everything to me.
A friend, sister, and family.

769
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:18,658
So please trust me,
and check out your boyfriend's house.

770
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,285
You're insane.

771
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,627
Do you like hearing all that
from your friend?

772
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,378
Can't you control your instincts?

773
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,507
I told you. It's not like that.

774
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,716
I can't help what I see.

775
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,426
It's the truth!

776
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,011
Don't you try things with me.

777
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,846
Crying won't help.

778
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,725
You can cry all you want,
but you're still a pervert.

779
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,727
It's the truth.

780
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,356
It's the truth, you asshole!

781
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,690
Okay?

782
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,194
I was right about the pickpocket,
the pesticides, and Jong-hyeok as well!

783
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,662
So there's a girl locked up
in the house of your college friend?

784
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,039
Should I go look into his house?

785
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:07,707
No.

786
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,460
She's not at his house.

787
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,671
-You said she was there.
-She was,

788
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,256
but not anymore.

789
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,425
What kind of bullcrap is this?

790
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,927
Is she there or not?

791
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,762
I don't know either.

792
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,891
Call me when that girl is at his house.

793
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,017
I’ll believe you then.

794
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,110
You were everything to me.
A friend, sister, and family.

795
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,446
So please trust me,
and check out your boyfriend's house.

796
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,874
Who the hell are you?

797
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,005
Honey?

798
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,260
This is who I really am.

799
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,682
Why did you hide it?

800
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,185
I thought if I told you,

801
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,814
you'd leave me.

802
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,819
I was going to tell you later
when I was brave enough.

803
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,866
I'm sorry.

804
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,327
It's okay.

805
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,541
This doesn't mean
that I'm not attractive as a woman.

806
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,133
Also…

807
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,261
Your lip color.

808
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,182
You'd look better in peach than red.

809
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,025
That brat.

810
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,777
How did she know?

811
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,123
STREAMER MS. SI-A
#LET'S_CHAT #TIME_TO_DANCE

812
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:21,883
It's the same room.

813
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,429
Hi, everyone.

814
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,098
It's me, Streamer Ms. Si-a.

815
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,600
-Thank you for the donation!
-It's her.

816
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,269
Since you donated 100,000 won,
I'll dance to "Heart Two."

817
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,651
You said that you'd only be with me!

818
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,653
Dance like when you get donations.

819
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,363
100,000 won should be enough
for a "Heart Two."

820
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,075
It's the same room and the same girl.

821
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,160
But why wasn't she there?
Did something happen?

822
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,704
Did I miss something?

823
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,638
I danced so hard that I'm sweating.

824
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,974
I'll go drink some water real quick.

825
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,983
…some water real quick.

826
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,158
The doorknob…

827
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,746
It's a different room.

828
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,083
STREAMER MS. SI-A

829
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,261
Hi, everyone. It's me, Streamer Ms. Si-a.

830
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,931
Today's video is called
"Come To Me Quick, Quick, Quick."

831
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,017
Do you see my address here?

832
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,020
This is where you can send me your gifts.

833
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,945
Mujin Police Station.

834
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,822
I'd like to speak
to Detective Moon Jang-yeol.

835
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,699
This is he. Who's this?

836
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,284
I'm…

837
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,327
the pervert.

838
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,037
I have something to tell you.

839
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,996
What is it?

840
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,458
Can you please believe me this once?

841
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,877
Why are you so serious?
It's not like you, perv.

842
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,171
The kidnapped girl I told you about.

843
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,048
I found out her name and address.

844
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,384
Unit 912, Star Apartments, Heungji-dong.

845
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,137
I just got here, and I'm about to go up.

846
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,182
I'm counting on you to come,
so I'm going in first.

847
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,185
Who said you could count on me?

848
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,063
I just want to.

849
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,484
I wanted to trust you
when I first told you that I was psychic.

850
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,070
And I still want to now.

851
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,824
I want to trust you, Detective.

852
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,910
All right.

853
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,162
Guys, we got a lead on Ted Chang.

854
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,831
Hurry up, let's go.

855
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,458
Whatever. You do whatever you want.

856
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,502
Wait.

857
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:12,095
STAR APARTMENTS

858
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,806
Hurry up and get in!

859
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,099
Get a move on!

860
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,359
Jong-hyeok.

861
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,198
I wasn't sure,

862
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:16,117
but you actually managed
to find this place.

863
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,165
Jong-hyeok.

864
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,044
You were in my house too, weren't you?

865
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,341
I have security cameras for the cats,

866
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,468
and they caught you.

867
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,015
Where is she?

868
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,229
I tried really hard…

869
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,774
to get her to live in my house.

870
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,402
And you ruined everything.

871
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,696
What did you do to--

872
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,739
Fuck!

873
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:58,952
I ask the questions.

874
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,747
You didn't talk to me once during college.

875
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,375
So why do you have to do this now?

876
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:06,918
I'm sorry about that.

877
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,046
But this is wrong, Jong-hyeok.

878
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,089
How did you know?

879
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,008
I never told anyone,
and it hasn't been on the news.

880
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,929
Are you psychic or something?

881
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:20,848
She's still alive, right?

882
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,560
Jeez, you're a handful.

883
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,688
I just finished cleaning.

884
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,024
Now I have to do it again

885
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,318
because of you!

886
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:33,987
Jong-hyeok!

887
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,341
You okay, perv?

888
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,940
Detective Moon!

889
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,525
Hurry!

890
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,695
Detective Moon!

891
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,071
Quickly!

892
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,660
Careful.

893
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,281
If we had been just a second late,
she would've died.

894
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,744
You saved her, Bong Ye-bun.

895
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,005
Do you believe me now?

896
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:23,054
They say Ted Chang
will be getting on a boat at Mujin Port.

897
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,055
They're sure of it.

898
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,474
It's our first big case in forever.

899
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,936
A safe city like Mujin
rarely sees cases this big.

900
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,396
Lieutenant Moon,

901
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,564
you might be able to
return to Seoul after all.

902
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,024
You lucked out.

903
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:38,736
Hey, gangster. Solve this case quickly
and just go back to Seoul.

904
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,238
I can't stand the sight of you.

905
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,577
I want to trust you, Detective.

906
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,038
Stop the car!

907
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,002
What are you doing?

908
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,421
I'll be back in 30 minutes.

909
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,422
Where are you going?

910
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,799
Someone's waiting for me.

911
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,303
Why aren't you answering me?

912
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,431
Do you believe me now?

913
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,475
Why would I?

914
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,478
Then why did you come?

915
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,692
Because I was worried.

916
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,778
-About me?
-No, the victim.

917
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,449
How dare you glare at me?
I just saved your life.

918
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,118
Aren't you going to thank me?

919
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,454
Thank you.

920
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,165
So you can really see all these things

921
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,624
when you touch people's butts?

922
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,001
You heard me.

923
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,505
It does sound like psychometry,

924
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,965
but why the butt?

925
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,178
Maybe it's because you love
touching people's butts.

926
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,220
What was that?

927
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,100
SANG-JUN, MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION

928
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,727
Hey.

929
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,438
Things just turned out that way.

930
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:01,152
But I think I'll still be able to
return to Seoul soon.

931
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,613
Yes.

932
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,947
I think I found something.

933
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,365
All right.

934
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,992
What does he take me for?

935
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:09,744
Bong Ye-bun.

936
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,288
Do you want to grab something to eat?

937
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,206
What?

938
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,501
I should reward you
for helping me catch the criminal.

939
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,544
Let's go. What do you want to eat?

940
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,426
By the way, how old are you?

941
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,552
I was born in 1988.

942
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,892
Why aren't you answering me?

943
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,310
What year were you born in?

944
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,525
Are you younger than me?

945
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,153
Were you born in 1989, you punk?

946
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,404
Why you little…

947
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:47,865
Then…

948
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,451
in 1988?

949
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,371
Or 1987?

950
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,915
You weren't born in 1990, were you?

951
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,291
Be quiet!

952
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:03,005
You better bow down low
and thank me every time you see me.

953
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,632
You owe me your life.

954
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,468
You little…

955
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,681
You said you were going to treat me!

956
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,060
What are we going to eat?

957
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:48,009
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

958
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,510
Hey, perv.

959
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,928
You see everything
when you touch someone's butt.

960
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,179
Then you could see the culprits.

961
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,890
These are the cases you'll be solving.

962
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,766
I'd like to phone a friend.

963
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,728
You got no friends 'cause you get ratioed.
All your jokes are so…

964
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,063
Go touch everyone.

965
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,189
What are you two up to?

966
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:05,109
An incompetent detective
is taking advantage of a psychic.

967
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,444
Delicate! Hands!

968
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,486
Faster, deeper.

969
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,155
-One! Two!
-Delicate! Hands!

970
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,866
There is someone
I'm interested in these days.

971
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:12,992
Really?

972
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,827
I could be the one he's interested in.

973
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,704
He even treated my wound.

974
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,915
Should I just check real quick?

975
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,292
Seon-woo, you have gum stuck to your butt.

976
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,960
Why couldn't I see anything?

977
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,921
Did I really lose my power?

978
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,047
I can't see anything anymore.

979
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,214
What?

980
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:33,012
