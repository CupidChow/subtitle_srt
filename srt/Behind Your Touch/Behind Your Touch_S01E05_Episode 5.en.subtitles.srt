1
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,512
Please let me go.

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,057
Please let me go.

4
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,268
Please let me go.

5
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,854
Please let me go.

6
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,776
Please let me go.

7
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,569
Please.

8
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,988
Please…

9
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,009
You started it!

10
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,803
You punched me first!

11
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,970
Bullshit.

12
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,436
What are you, a bunch of gangsters?

13
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,696
Enough!

14
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
Everyone, be quiet!

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,161
This isn't a marketplace,
for crying out loud.

16
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:02,914
Goodness.

17
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,668
So just tell me how the fight started.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,463
I told you already.
They were the ones who provoked us.

19
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,799
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,176
I clearly heard
that number one hit number two.

21
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,469
That's not what happened!

22
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,471
I only jumped in

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,640
-because number two made the first move!
-All right.

24
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,267
I see.

25
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
So tell me.

26
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,646
Who started it?

27
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:34,821
Raise your hands if you think
number one hit number two first.

28
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,995
Raise your hands if you think
it was the other way around.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,873
What's going on?

30
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,916
Were you all seeing things or something?

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,627
Hey! Raise your hand.

32
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,045
Come on.

33
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,923
There you go again.

34
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,841
You hit me first!

35
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,259
No, you hit me first!

36
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,565
Assemblyman Cha's aide was at the office
on the day it happened.

37
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,525
You see the woman
with brown hair over there?

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,651
Go touch her.

39
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,819
Ok-hui!

40
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,285
Babe, you're…

41
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,698
DONOR LIST (AUGUST)

42
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,706
Why are you back already?

43
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,108
Did you really not see anything?

44
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,111
There was something fishy
about that woman.

45
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,447
I told you, I didn't.

46
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,324
Then what about the others?

47
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,493
Did you see anything suspicious?

48
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,289
Did you?

49
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,305
DELETE

50
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:31,974
No, I didn't.

51
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,353
I was in such a rush

52
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,064
that I couldn't actually tell
what I was seeing.

53
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,359
Listen, perv.

54
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,238
I need you to work harder, okay?

55
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,991
The Iron Palm Training
strengthened your hands, didn't it?

56
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,370
You have to keep improving your power.

57
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,123
I'm telling you,
there's something off about this town.

58
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,335
Then…

59
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,713
what happens now?

60
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,632
What do you mean?

61
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,385
I'm talking about the stolen document.

62
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,387
We'll have to catch the culprit
no matter what.

63
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,097
This is a very important case for me.

64
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,435
You develop a hunch
after being a detective for a while.

65
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,270
And my hunch tells me

66
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,397
something's up with the aide
and that woman.

67
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,774
I'll grill or tail them if I have to.

68
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,277
I don't think this is a simple theft.

69
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,339
A BETTER MUJIN! CENTER OF TOURISM!
NO.1 CHA JU-MAN

70
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,729
Give me what you took.

71
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,899
Why did you do it?

72
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,318
It's none of your business.
Just give it to me.

73
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,820
I already put it back.

74
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,913
Mr. Cha is like a son to you.

75
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,831
What are you going to do?

76
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,416
Make some money off of it?

77
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,505
You'll find out later.

78
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,634
There's a witness,
and the police are investigating.

79
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,053
You'll get caught when they dig deeper.

80
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,971
I don't know what you're up to,

81
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:34,889
but please stop.

82
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,891
Move aside.

83
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,936
Why don't you ever listen to me?

84
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,563
Why did you take me in in the first place?

85
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,648
You should've just said

86
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:48,152
that you can't stand the sight of me
and that you don't want to live with me.

87
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,240
Who's there?

88
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,701
It's me.

89
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,537
What brings you here, sir?

90
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,290
I had something to take care of.

91
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,125
All right, then.

92
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,186
Well done.

93
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,021
Thank you, sis.

94
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,315
-Good job.
-Thank you, sis.

95
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,109
-You did well.
-Thank you, sis.

96
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,277
-Great job.
-Thank you, sis.

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,695
-Well done.
-Thank you, sis.

98
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,154
-Good job.
-Thank you, sis.

99
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,116
-Thank you for your service.
-Yes.

100
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,951
Thank you, sis.

101
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,666
What's wrong?

102
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,460
The hair on the front of my head

103
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,047
had been transplanted
from the back of my head.

104
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,925
You should've told me beforehand.

105
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,345
I wanted you to pull my hair
without hesitation.

106
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,223
That's why.

107
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,226
You must be so thoughtful
because you're a teacher.

108
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,519
A round of applause.

109
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,190
It was nothing, sis.

110
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,119
General MacArthur.

111
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,538
You like these, don't you?

112
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,005
Please accept my offerings

113
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,884
and fill me up with your divine energy.

114
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:39,138
Please help yourself.

115
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,755
Nearer, my God, to Thee

116
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,507
Nearer to…

117
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,432
Everyone who calls upon

118
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,809
The name of the Lord

119
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,937
Shall be saved

120
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,523
Everyone who calls upon…

121
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,585
We're over the hump.

122
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,837
He'll be okay.

123
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,213
Here.

124
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,468
How did you find him?

125
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,596
I went up the mountain at dawn to pray,

126
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,057
and I heard strange noises
coming from the ground.

127
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,144
So I dug into the dirt and found the puppy

128
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,438
buried alive with his mouth bound up.

129
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,231
What kind of a lunatic does that?

130
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,734
Maybe there was a reason.

131
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,236
I doubt it.

132
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,780
They probably abandoned it
because they got tired of it.

133
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,533
Monsters like them

134
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,994
need to be brought to justice.

135
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,872
I agree. We must catch them.

136
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,758
Let me touch you for a bit, okay?

137
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,688
You little shit.

138
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,732
Hey, I told you not to crap.

139
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,151
How many times do I have to tell you?

140
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,236
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

141
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,052
You're okay now.

142
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:24,762
You're safe.

143
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,556
MUJIN POLICE STATION

144
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,974
All right.

145
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,309
Yes, I understand.

146
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,519
Okay, bye.

147
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,356
-Where are you going?
-To investigate Assemblyman Cha's case.

148
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,066
Right, they found the document.

149
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,360
What? Where?

150
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,488
It was deep inside the safe.
They apologized for making a fuss.

151
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,741
That doesn't make any sense.
We searched the safe so many times.

152
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:46,951
No, it doesn't.

153
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,786
But they said they found it.

154
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,331
This is an important period
for Assemblyman Cha.

155
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,626
I guess they don't want to
cause any trouble.

156
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,420
Still, we should catch the thief.

157
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,048
How? They haven't lost anything anymore.

158
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:08,097
-I'm going to catch the thief.
-Come on, don't be like that.

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,225
If this goes wrong, I'll lose my job too.

160
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,810
How about

161
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,480
I get you a huge case
that will get you back to Seoul instead?

162
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,065
What kind of case is it?

163
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,775
There will be one soon.

164
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,069
Forget it. I'm going after the thief.

165
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,904
You're driving me nuts here.

166
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,950
No one wants to send you back to Seoul
as much as I do.

167
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,828
I desperately want to send you back.

168
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,788
Just go back to your desk and stay put.

169
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,165
Come on, just sit down.

170
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,959
I'll take care of everything. Go.

171
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,673
Sweetie.

172
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,384
How come we're short of money?

173
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,511
I'm not sure.

174
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,762
Maybe we got robbed.

175
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,851
Who on earth would steal just 30,000 won?

176
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,936
It was 20,000 won, not 30,000 won.

177
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,937
You little brat.

178
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,939
Your brother is a cop,

179
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,108
and there's another cop living upstairs.

180
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,151
How dare you?

181
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,028
Captain.

182
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,488
What brings you here, Ali?

183
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,406
We have a problem.

184
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,866
You need to go check out the boat.

185
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,534
What?

186
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,663
Look. Did it sprout legs and run away?

187
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,375
Where on earth did my fish finder go?

188
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,753
Was it an expensive one?

189
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,754
You bet!

190
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,340
I bought the latest model!

191
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,593
If I had known,

192
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,845
I would have feasted on meat instead.

193
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,764
This is bad.

194
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,227
That punk is over the moon.

195
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,147
Are there no security cameras here?

196
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,108
Why would I have security cameras
on this tiny boat?

197
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,949
Who else knew
that there was a fish finder in your boat?

198
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,576
The whole neighborhood.

199
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,870
My dad bragged about it whenever he could.

200
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,166
Then is there anyone you're suspicious of?

201
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,835
No one in this neighborhood
would do such a thing.

202
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,213
Of course there is.

203
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,297
Sorry?

204
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,342
I told you from the beginning
that we shouldn't hire him.

205
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,178
I had a bad feeling about him
from the get-go.

206
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,473
He practically lives on the boat,
so how could he not have seen anything?

207
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,183
Who are you talking about?

208
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,643
Who else?

209
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,645
-Ali, of course.
-Come on now.

210
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,816
He said he went into town that day
to meet a friend.

211
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,567
He doesn't have any friends.

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,362
And how convenient is it

213
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,739
that he happened to go
meet a friend that day?

214
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,409
He would never do such a thing.

215
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,327
Is that so?

216
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,496
Listen, Detective.

217
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,667
There was also a theft
in the factory Ali used to work at.

218
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,962
He was the suspect back then too
and was about to be kicked out.

219
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:48,924
But this man took pity on him
and let him live on his boat.

220
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,427
Do you see now why I'm suspecting him?

221
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,345
There you go again.

222
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,764
Blab, blab, blab.

223
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,141
You're such a blabbermouth.

224
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,476
Stop it, all right?

225
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,103
Before I kick you out.

226
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,022
What? Kick me out?

227
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,819
If only I hadn't gone stargazing that day.

228
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,697
What is this about all of a sudden?

229
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,824
That's when Ok-hui was conceived.

230
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:19,246
Says the one who had so much fun
counting the stars.

231
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,791
I only counted up to ten.

232
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,085
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

233
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,837
What does that mean?

234
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,797
It's quite inappropriate,

235
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,008
so I'd rather not explain it myself.

236
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,801
I'm fed up with you now.

237
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,470
Is that so?

238
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
That leaves me no choice then.

239
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,850
Deok-hee, go up the mountain

240
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,186
and bring back a piece of wood this big.

241
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,896
What for?

242
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,815
He wants to carve a seal out of it.

243
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,484
To stamp on divorce papers.

244
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,277
Deok-hee.

245
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,864
Go and bring back some more wood.

246
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,408
To make her own seal?

247
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,453
She wants to make a casket for my dad.

248
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,122
Deok-hee,
will you be getting married soon?

249
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,500
She's asking who I want to live with.

250
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,709
Quiet!

251
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,127
Just pour me a drink.

252
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,804
"Drop dead, you pain in the butt!"

253
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,555
-Why, you…
-That's what she means.

254
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,266
I should just…

255
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,643
You should just what?

256
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,019
-What? You…
-Calm down.

257
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,146
Don't start a fight.

258
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,940
You're making a scene.

259
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,943
He doesn't want anyone to miss the show.

260
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,570
That's enough, for Pete's sake.

261
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,864
Let's all just have a drink.

262
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,700
Here. Let me pour you one.

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,086
In any case, he's our prime suspect.

264
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,464
He is, under the circumstances.

265
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,551
The case seems rather small.

266
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,219
It seems to be a simple theft.

267
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,388
This isn't a small case.

268
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,599
There have been
a series of fish finder thefts

269
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,436
in multiple places
including Museong and Jungsan.

270
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,983
It seems like they're working in cells.

271
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,776
Organized crime…

272
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,946
That would give me extra points, right?

273
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,075
You seem excited.

274
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,869
Goodness me.

275
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,245
Listen.

276
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,373
You should learn to approach crimes
with a pure heart.

277
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,750
How's that even possible?

278
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,420
I guess it isn't.

279
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,342
Anyway, what's with this
random background music?

280
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,693
What the hell is she doing?

281
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,655
I think she's just off her rocker.

282
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,383
You have a crush on someone again,
don't you?

283
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,553
-Does it show?
-It does.

284
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,056
Seeing you play that
for the first time in forever,

285
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,642
I'm guessing you must be pretty serious.

286
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,185
Kind of.

287
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,772
But what are you doing here?

288
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,484
There's…

289
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,111
something I have to get back.

290
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,863
What is it?

291
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,672
Here.

292
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,965
Thanks, Jong-muk.

293
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,940
For Pete's sake.

294
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,447
Why are you laughing?

295
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,574
You're a mess. Hold this.

296
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,586
There you go.

297
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,464
Done?

298
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,669
-Jong-muk.
-Come here.

299
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,839
Ok-hui, tell Ye-bun
not to eat dinner without me.

300
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,966
I won't be long at the station.

301
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,719
No, she'll be behind bars for a year.

302
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,471
Tell Ye-bun to eat without her.

303
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,098
Where are you going?

304
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,142
-I have to go somewhere.
-Where?

305
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,685
It's about the case.

306
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,771
I know how to solve it, so leave it to me.

307
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,199
I told you not to crap.

308
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,533
How many times do I have to tell you?

309
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,787
I'm going to get you, you punk.

310
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,626
But I don't think he's from around here.

311
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,419
Hey, perv.

312
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,131
Stop calling me that.

313
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,052
Bong, I need you to work with me.

314
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,762
What is it now?

315
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,931
Get ready. We need to go.

316
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,099
I don't know what it is,

317
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,976
but help me out first this time.

318
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,816
I told you I'm allergic to fur.

319
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,070
Some lunatic buried this cutie alive
in the mountains.

320
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,154
I touched his butt,

321
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,949
and it seemed like
he'd been neglected and abused.

322
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,202
He was buried in the mountain
with his mouth bound up.

323
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,703
We need to get this bastard.

324
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,957
I'm all for that,
but let's solve another case first.

325
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,168
No. I'm not going anywhere
until we solve this.

326
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,797
I just need you to touch
someone's butt real quick.

327
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,134
I'm not touching any butts
until we solve this.

328
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,677
Are you serious?

329
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,719
Yes, I am.

330
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,971
If you solve this,

331
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,307
I'll touch all the butts you want me to
without a single complaint.

332
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,561
Fine.

333
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,730
But you have to do as I say
once we catch this guy.

334
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,982
Of course.

335
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,942
First, we have to go meet someone.

336
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,777
-Who?
-The person who found the dog.

337
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,945
We need to question him.

338
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,840
Are you telling fortunes right now?

339
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,550
No.

340
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,343
I'm picking out weevils.

341
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,264
Is anyone normal in this neighborhood?

342
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,982
So your life's been
full of ups and downs, hasn't it?

343
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,236
You don't belong here.
Yet somehow you ended up here.

344
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,534
You'd better hurry back to Seoul.

345
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,914
Are you surprised?

346
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,625
"How does he know all that?"

347
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,793
I am surprised.

348
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,215
Why did Detective Na tell you all that?

349
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,927
How did you know?

350
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,179
If she uses police authority
to catch her cheating husband,

351
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,597
I'm sure she's been here too.

352
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,894
He's investigating
the live burial incident.

353
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,354
So just tell him what you saw.

354
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,483
When did you find the dog?

355
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,360
Early this morning.

356
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,821
I was praying on the mountain.

357
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,907
Which mountain was it?

358
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,617
Mount Mujin, obviously.

359
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,370
Go on.

360
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,165
So I dug into the ground

361
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,917
and found a puppy there.

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,252
What breed?

363
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,462
He's a Maltese.

364
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,214
Why ask what we already know?

365
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,134
I thought it could lead us to other clues.

366
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,721
And?

367
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:02,519
The puppy was buried in the ground
with his mouth bound up.

368
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,062
With twine?

369
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,356
Or shoelaces? Hoodie strings? Bag straps?

370
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,653
What was he bound up with?

371
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,822
-Twine.
-What the hell?

372
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,157
Just to be sure.

373
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,245
Seon-woo.

374
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,789
You're trying to catch
the one who buried the puppy, right?

375
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,667
I want to help.

376
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,085
Really?

377
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,211
That would be great.

378
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,217
Now that we're all gathered here,

379
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,345
it feels like we're the Avengers,
don't you think?

380
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,139
You're the investigator.

381
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,390
You're the brains.

382
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,309
And you're the one with the sixth sense.

383
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,311
What about you?

384
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,478
Me?

385
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,022
I am…

386
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,191
You'd be the pervert.

387
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,154
What he means is, I can't stand perverts.

388
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,574
He knows me so well because we're close.

389
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,744
I didn't know you two were close.

390
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,456
I thought you only recently met.

391
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,750
We somehow got close.

392
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,127
No, not somehow.

393
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,130
When we first met,
she was touching some man's--

394
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,593
Now, where should we begin?

395
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,557
From a criminal psychology perspective,

396
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,602
the culprit is likely an outsider
familiar with this area.

397
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,686
Why?

398
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,481
Imagine you're abandoning something.

399
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,860
Then you'd instinctively look for
places far away.

400
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,403
And the dog's mouth was bound up

401
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,114
to prevent it from barking
and attracting attention.

402
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,159
So they must have known a place
where they wouldn't get caught.

403
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,037
Many murderers dump the bodies

404
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,040
in their childhood neighborhoods
or near their parents' graves.

405
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,834
Places they're familiar with.

406
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,548
He would have driven
to come all the way here.

407
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,634
First, we have to find that car

408
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,220
and look for evidence
that could still be at the scene.

409
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,013
Is that so?

410
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,807
Then we should split into groups.

411
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,893
Seon-woo and I will go to the scene
and look for evidence.

412
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,311
You and Mr. Park

413
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,897
can look for the car.

414
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,066
Why do you get to decide the groups?

415
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,150
All right. Let's go.

416
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,568
Let's get moving.

00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,641
I don't see anything out of the ordinary.

424
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,441
Seon-woo.

425
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,454
Seon-woo.

426
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,957
I wish all the bad people in this world
would just disappear.

427
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,335
Me too.

428
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:00,173
I promise I'll catch him
for your sake as well.

429
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,556
Why are you taking pictures?

430
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,308
To post on social media.

431
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,727
If I post them
with a picture of the puppy,

432
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,521
someone might recognize him.

433
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,650
I knew you were our brains.

00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,223
And where are you going?

439
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,267
To the restroom.

440
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,021
How far did you get?
Did you find any evidence?

441
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,439
-What about the license number?
-Look.

442
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,568
Do you know how many cars
I have to look into?

443
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,736
Which is why you should try harder.

444
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,114
That kind of jerk
has to be brought to justice.

445
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,491
I checked the footage all night
but found nothing.

446
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,993
This isn't going to work.

447
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,412
Can't you just do something
with the puppy's butt?

448
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,791
The footage was cropped and blurry,
maybe because he hasn't recovered yet.

449
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,878
And since he was locked away
most of the time,

450
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,462
his vision was limited.

451
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,132
That's some power you've got.

452
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,303
But I see in color now,
instead of black and white.

453
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,430
Since when?

454
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:34,267
Since you took care of my hands
after Iron Palm Training.

455
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,477
So your power gets upgraded

456
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,313
the more you take care of your hands?

457
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,397
I guess so.

458
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,901
Wait.

459
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,278
-You see a dog's memories in color?
-Yes.

460
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,946
I thought dogs could only see
in black and white.

461
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,448
Says who?

462
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,741
That's just common sense.

463
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,826
Look it up online. All the experts say so.

464
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,703
I heard they did an experiment in the US.

465
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,914
They found that dogs
can't tell colors apart.

466
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,417
Did they actually ask the dogs?

467
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,129
Dogs can see in color too.

468
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,882
-Come with me.
-Where are we going now?

469
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,801
Everything is up to my hands now.

470
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,219
Remember when my fingerprints were gone?

471
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,680
I could see things in color
and in better quality

472
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,140
after taking care of my hands.

473
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,559
No matter how good the software is,

474
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,686
it's no use if the hardware can't keep up.

475
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,439
So I'm upgrading the hardware.

476
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,317
All right already.
Let's get it over with and just go.

477
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,235
What about these colors?

478
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,821
They would suit your fair skin.

479
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,865
They're so pretty.

480
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,994
I'll go with this one.

481
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,997
This is a limited edition,
so it's a bit expensive.

482
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,248
That's no problem.

483
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,131
-Would you like to see the stones too?
-Yes, please.

484
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,844
They're so pretty.

485
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,805
This one's really pretty.

486
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,140
Should we put them on?

487
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,853
I don't think I can get stones
because of my job.

488
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,106
Do you want designs then?

489
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,399
Yes, I do.

490
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,693
Go ahead and pay first.

491
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,153
Why am I paying for this?

492
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,114
I'm not doing this just for myself.

493
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,658
This will be the foundation
of our investigations.

494
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,327
Don't you want to go back to Seoul?

495
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,165
Please begin.

496
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,262
All right.

497
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,311
You little shit.

498
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,896
I told you not to crap.

499
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,398
How many times do I have to tell you?

500
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,860
So? Is there a difference?

501
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,778
I can see very clearly.

502
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,197
The resolution was about 360p before.

503
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,616
But now, I think it's about 1080p.

504
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,161
What difference does that make?

505
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,912
Exactly. It's time for the next step.

506
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,039
Next step?

507
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,792
It's so pretty.

508
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,129
It goes perfectly with my nails.

509
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:37,992
Let's see.

510
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,965
I got thumbnails.

511
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,146
I can see timestamps.

512
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,401
So?

513
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,820
Did anything else change?

514
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:17,406
It now comes with thumbnails
and in chronological order.

515
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,367
Then did you find out
where the culprit lives?

516
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,368
No.

517
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,332
Maybe diamonds will do the job.

518
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,334
What are you, a snake oil salesman?

519
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,670
Snake oil?

520
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,338
-No, we don't need this.
-Yes, this is it.

521
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,590
I'll take some lutein
and vitamin D supplements as well.

522
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,551
-No, we don't need them.
-That "forte" something.

523
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,095
-This isn't what I was talking about.
-Yes, that one.

524
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,806
-Please put it back.
-The one that says "forte."

525
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,683
Vitamins, magnesium,

526
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,768
this one's for my joints,
and this is cartilage collagen.

527
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,728
This is for my brain, and this is calcium.

528
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,188
All these pills can cause stomachache,

529
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,773
so some gastrointestinal medicine.
And this--

530
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,775
-What's that one now?
-It prevents hair loss.

531
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,735
You're going to die
if you take all of that.

532
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,280
We have to find Tofu's owner.

533
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,073
Tofu?

534
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,074
It's his name.

535
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,367
He's white like tofu.

536
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,891
It became wider.

537
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,145
JUNGSAN CAR REPAIR

538
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,398
I think I found Tofu's home.

539
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,818
There are so many apartments.

540
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,695
We couldn't possibly go door to door.

541
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,031
-What should we do?
-We don't have to find it.

542
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,954
What are you doing? What if we lose him?

543
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,206
Follow him.

544
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
I think it's this one.

545
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,944
It's him.

546
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,862
Who are you people?

547
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,198
I'm from Mujin Police Station.
We need to talk.

548
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,701
What?

549
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,953
Are you hiding something?

550
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,872
This is your puppy, isn't it?

551
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,958
What are you talking about?

552
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,584
I've never seen this piece of shit.

553
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,502
Scram.

554
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,962
Why, you asshole.

555
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,802
See?

556
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,429
No matter how terrible you are,

557
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,306
he's protecting you

558
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,725
just because you were his owner.

559
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:59,026
I bought him because I heard
dog videos were profitable.

560
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,196
But I wasn't getting enough views,
and he was costing me money.

561
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,614
So I got rid of him.

562
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,575
Anyway, I'm not keeping him.

563
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,830
You shouldn't have gotten a dog
if you couldn't afford it.

564
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,500
And you should never have abandoned it
or at least done so in a humane way.

565
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,377
Was all this abuse necessary?

566
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,756
You don't deserve to have a dog
in the first place.

567
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,550
Let's go, Tofu.

568
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,279
You're under arrest for violating
the Animal Protection Act.

569
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,031
You can be sentenced to
up to two years in prison

570
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,699
or be fined up to 20 million won…

571
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,665
I want to go home.

572
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,710
Home…

573
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,880
I have to go to the hospital…

574
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,473
-Let's go.
-Go where?

575
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,183
I have to work today.

576
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,976
It's all about give and take.

577
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,853
-Let's go touch some butts.
-Wait.

578
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,521
Can…

579
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,775
Can we wait another day?

580
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,193
Why?

581
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,904
If I'm not careful while touching things,

582
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,280
my nails could break and…

583
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,788
that would be better
than having my neck broken.

584
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,925
What is this about?

585
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,677
I need to know what to look for.

586
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,640
Touch him and see
if he stole a fish finder.

587
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,100
How?

588
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,148
Hey, Ali.

589
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,112
-Everything going all right?
-Yes, everything's all right.

590
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,114
-Okay. Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

591
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,287
Ali.

592
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,997
-Yes?
-There's gum on your butt.

593
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,977
-You really didn't see it?
-No.

594
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,688
Then what did he do in town that day?

595
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,273
He was at a coffee shop all day.

596
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,483
-With who?
-By himself.

597
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,401
By himself?

598
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
He said he went out to meet a friend.

599
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,948
He didn't meet anyone before that?

600
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,075
He did.

601
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,413
He's been meeting up
with the same man recently.

602
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,514
What were they saying?

603
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,557
I don't know.

604
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,642
They were speaking in their language.

605
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,270
It sounded like Arabic.

606
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,855
Too bad.

607
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,357
I wish I could help,
but there's nothing I can do.

608
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,902
I guess I'm done.

609
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,197
-Oh, come on.
-You can't just leave.

610
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,199
Then what do you want me to do?

611
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,783
Leave the ring.

612
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,619
-Excuse me?
-Take it off.

613
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,703
I'm getting a refund.

614
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,622
-No.
-Take it off. Come here.

615
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,789
-This isn't fair.
-Let go.

616
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,708
-Let go.
-It's mine!

617
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,961
-No, you can't take it away.
-Let go!

618
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,555
I almost lost it.

619
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,687
Ok-hui.

620
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,397
Is something wrong?

621
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,609
I have too much going on in my head.

622
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,486
What happened?

623
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,697
I have feelings for this guy,

624
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,326
but he was looking all lovey-dovey
with another woman.

625
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,829
Is Detective Moon seeing someone?

626
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,750
The thing is,

627
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,293
that woman

628
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:27,962
is a friend of mine.

629
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,755
What?

630
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,510
You're talking about me.

631
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,015
That damn mosquito.

632
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,738
Ok-hui.

633
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,365
It's not what you think.

634
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,702
I was just helping him catch the thief
who stole your dad's fish finder.

635
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,036
Don't worry.

636
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,455
I'll pretend he's a stranger
once this is over.

637
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,416
No, I'll just pretend he's a rock.

638
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,255
Now I can stretch my legs.

639
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:12,923
Really?

640
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,678
VETERINARIAN LICENSE, MEMBER OF THE KVMA

641
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,556
ARABIC-KOREAN VOCABULARY

642
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,975
What do you want me to do with this?

643
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,351
Study.

644
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,228
Arabic?

645
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,271
At my age?

646
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,899
Listen, you know full well
what I had to do to find Tofu's owner.

647
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,902
I watched CCTV footage for 18 hours
and ran license checks for 6 hours.

648
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,195
That's 24 hours in total.

649
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,322
Look,

650
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,324
I get that you put in hard work, but--

651
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,368
If I did all that,
the least you can do is put in the effort.

652
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,955
It's not like I'll understand Arabic
if I study overnight.

653
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,374
Then ask someone who knows Arabic.

654
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,545
How can I do that
when I can't even mimic one word?

655
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,671
That's my point.

656
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,757
Just study until you can mimic words.

657
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,552
I mean…

658
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,896
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.

659
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,149
I can't even mimic the sounds.

660
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,285
Hello, Dr. Bong.

661
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,203
Hello.

662
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,162
-Come on in.
-Hi.

663
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,581
Hi, Minnie.

664
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,001
ARABIC ALPHABET

665
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,137
I chose natural sciences
because I hate memorizing.

666
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,441
Ali!

667
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,319
Hello.

668
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,289
I don't understand a word.

669
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,096
I can't do this.

670
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,318
-Hello?
-Why is your light off already?

671
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,079
He's insane.

672
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,541
How can you go to bed right now?

673
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,794
So I guess you're pretty much fluent now?

674
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,422
Fine! I won't sleep!

675
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,924
That little…

676
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:16,815
I'm exhausted.

677
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,986
I know what to do to feel better.

678
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,250
I'm already feeling better.

679
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,938
Hello.

680
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,861
When will I be able to understand this?

681
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,574
Hello, Dr. Bong.

682
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,867
Hello.

683
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,079
You seem close with Ali.

684
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,748
What did you two talk about?

685
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,460
He said he couldn't live without kimchi

686
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,587
and that he was practically Korean now.

687
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,715
He came to buy ramyeon and kimchi.

688
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,761
I guess he's good at Korean.

689
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,514
Then why doesn't he just speak Korean?

690
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,059
We spoke in Arabic, not Korean.

691
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,978
What?

692
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,938
You speak Arabic?

693
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,733
I chose to study Arabic
as my foreign language for the CSAT.

694
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,277
Thanks to that,

695
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,070
I can hold a simple conversation.

696
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,530
Oh, my goodness.

697
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,117
Then could you perhaps tutor me?

698
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,785
Tutor you?

699
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,538
If it's okay with you,

700
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,164
you could teach me a little bit

701
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:59,126
when you tutor Mr. Park.

702
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,255
I'll talk to Mr. Park about it.

703
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,134
MEANING: I'M SORRY

704
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,428
Look here.

705
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,347
You form the present progressive tense

706
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,932
by adding "ing" to a verb.

707
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,476
It's used to talk about
an action in progress.

708
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,855
Let me give you an example.

709
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,775
Here's the word, "drink."

710
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,320
What would be
its present progressive form?

711
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,322
"Drinking."

712
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,659
"Drink" becomes "drinking." That's it.

713
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,795
Dr. Bong.

714
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,505
-Yes?
-How is this pronounced?

715
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,597
He's told you many times already.

716
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,601
You're not as smart as I thought.

717
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,896
Have you reviewed all progressive forms?

718
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,481
Yes.

719
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,233
What does "fish" mean?

720
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,653
Mulgogi, fish.

721
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,613
What does adding an "ing" make it?

722
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,414
Mulgo…

723
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,499
ging?

724
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,918
It's "fishing," of course.

725
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,461
How do you not know that?

726
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,007
You should both focus on
your own material.

727
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,720
I'm struggling with what I need to learn,

728
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,138
but I understand hers perfectly.

729
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,973
Same here.

730
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,937
I've tutored countless people so far,
but you two are just…

731
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,318
Don't try to understand.

732
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,778
Just memorize it.

733
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,156
You want to understand first?
Just memorize.

734
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,117
Memorization is the way to go.

735
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,952
Memorization.

736
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,579
Let's take a break.

737
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,923
Dr. Bong.

738
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,675
Yes?

739
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,468
Don't you think

740
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,512
he's kind of full of himself?

741
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,850
A little.

742
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,105
Listening comprehension
is key in learning foreign languages.

743
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,857
Listen as much as you can.

744
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,537
How's the studying going? Any progress?

745
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,496
Don't doze off.

746
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,748
Hey, wake up!

747
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,541
Should I remind you again
of what I did for you?

748
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,091
I can transcribe now.

749
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,636
Try to recall, Ye-bun.

750
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,687
Can you understand this?

751
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,610
What's this?

752
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,364
I wrote down what I heard.

753
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,664
Can you understand any of it?

754
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:07,999
I'm not sure,

755
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,835
but I think this word means "mom."

756
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,503
Is that right?

757
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,630
And the second word

758
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,799
means "ill," I think.

759
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:19,886
That's right.

760
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,721
What about the third one?

761
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,557
I think it means "surgery."

762
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,395
"Mom," "ill," "surgery"?

763
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,814
"My mom is ill and needs surgery"?

764
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,983
The last word is "money."

765
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:37,279
"My mom is ill and needs surgery,
so I need money"!

766
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,739
Detective Moon!

767
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,783
I found out what it means.

768
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,993
You did?

769
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,829
Ali's mom is ill and needs surgery,

770
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,997
so he needs money!

771
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
And you're smiling?

772
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:51,668
It's so sad, isn't it?

773
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,297
Is that why he stole the fish finder?

774
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,841
But it was the other guy
who mentioned money.

775
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:04,890
Ali.

776
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,100
Hello, sir.

777
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,478
Don't be so formal. We're neighbors.

778
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,230
Right.

779
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,815
By the way,

780
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,651
I hear your mother is quite ill.

781
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,653
Sorry?

782
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,697
And she needs surgery.

783
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,784
Can you afford it?

784
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,540
I know you didn't do it alone.

785
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,669
Where are the other guys?

786
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,933
Now, go ahead and touch his butt.

787
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,810
Why don't you just go and arrest him?

788
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,605
I'm not here just for him.
I'm going to root them all out.

789
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,774
That's the man I saw in Ali's memories.

790
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,150
-He is?
-Yes.

791
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,860
Where are you going?

792
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,237
We should wait for backup.

793
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,656
There are only two of them.
That'd be a hassle.

794
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,282
-Move.
-What?

795
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,035
Hey!

796
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,704
You know Ali, right?

797
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:56,835
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney…

798
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,673
One, two, three, four, five…

799
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,342
There's a whole lot of them.

800
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,802
What do we do?

801
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,221
-Can you run fast?
-I'm not half bad.

802
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,808
Listen. Run away on my count of three.

803
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,351
What about you?

804
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,769
Don't worry about me and run.

805
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,604
On three, all right?

806
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,775
One.

807
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,028
Why, you…

808
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,705
I should have started running
before you said "one."

809
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,756
Look at us.

810
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,758
I told you we should call backup.

811
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,760
I clearly told you to run at three.

812
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,387
There's no way I could've run away
if I waited that long.

813
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:53,433
You could have escaped
when I started fighting them at three.

814
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,684
Am I wrong?

815
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,644
So that was your plan.

816
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,943
We may steal, but we don't harm people.

817
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,280
But we can't just let them go.

818
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,407
I'll go to jail, and you'll be deported.

819
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,742
Then what do you suggest?

820
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,202
We have to get rid of them.

821
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,248
Can you even understand anything?

822
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,000
Be quiet.

823
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,131
That's "water."

824
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,176
That's "dump."

825
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,177
"Water," "dump"…

826
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,346
They're going to dump us in the water.

827
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,722
My goodness.

828
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,433
I can understand Arabic now.

829
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,560
You happy?

830
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,230
How can you laugh in this situation?

831
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,527
At this rate,
we'll both end up being fish food.

832
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,363
Let's get out of here.

833
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,447
Is there a way?

834
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,116
We'll untie ourselves.

835
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,242
How?

836
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,619
All cops are trained
for situations like this.

837
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,333
First, put your hands
behind your butt and…

838
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,422
Give me a second here.

839
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,142
I'm almost there. Don't worry.

840
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,452
Ali.

841
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,666
-They're putting us on the boat.
-I can figure out that much.

842
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,934
What do we do?

843
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,102
Don't worry.

844
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,741
Oh, my gosh.

845
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,994
No! Wait!

846
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,662
Wait a second!

847
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,706
I'm sorry.

848
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,170
What do we do?

849
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,463
We're sorry.

850
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,423
Please let us go!

851
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,092
Please let us go! We're sorry!

852
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,239
WHAT DO WE DO?

853
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,324
JUST TRUST ME

854
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,061
Are you all right?

855
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,943
Thank you, Ali.

856
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,082
What are we doing back here?

857
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,835
Ask him how to say
"You're all dead" in Arabic.

858
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,844
Wait, I can speak Arabic.

859
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,679
I can speak Arabic now.

860
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,890
Is she right?

861
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,650
You two stay right here.

862
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,277
What? Detective Moon…

863
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,570
I'm sorry, sir.

864
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,947
I betrayed your kindness.

865
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,575
Did you

866
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,494
really do it?

867
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,042
His mother was ill,

868
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,086
and he couldn't afford the surgery.

869
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,256
You're under arrest for special larceny.

870
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,758
-What are you doing?
-Wait, Detective.

871
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,719
-You have the right to an attorney and…
-Come on.

872
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:26,474
You must be mistaken, Detective.

873
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:30,436
I never lost any fish finder.

874
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,856
How could anyone have stolen
something I never lost?

875
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,941
Right?

876
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:39,112
Did you maybe sell it to buy alcohol

877
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,571
and lie about losing it?

878
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,032
That's right.

879
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,534
You figured it out.

880
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,910
To tell you the truth,

881
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,787
I sold it to the junk shop

882
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,039
so I could buy myself a drink.

883
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,457
That's so typical of him.

884
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,084
I knew it.

885
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,919
We blamed Ali for no reason.

886
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,464
I see what you're trying to do,
but that won't make his crime go away.

887
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,590
-I mean…
-Wait…

888
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,468
Ali is a good kid.

889
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,971
So please let him off just this once.

890
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,431
Move aside, please.

891
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,435
He saved us, didn't he?

892
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,686
We owe him our lives.

893
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:15,314
And given the circumstances,
can't you just look the other way?

894
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,983
What circumstances?

895
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,026
He's still a criminal.

896
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,903
-What?
-Wait.

897
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,530
-Detective Moon.
-Detective…

898
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,532
-I mean…
-Come on.

899
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,950
Do something.

900
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,430
-I think I got something.
-What is it?

901
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:52,602
What's this?

902
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,479
What's a woman's earring doing here?

903
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,523
Maybe there's a corpse somewhere.

904
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,151
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

905
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,246
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

906
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,622
We have a case!

907
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,207
There's been a series of disappearances.

908
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,500
-Let's go!
-What?

909
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,544
-Yes, go ahead and touch me.
-What?

910
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,003
Your power has improved a lot.

911
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,797
Maybe you'll see something I missed.

912
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,091
I know this person.

913
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,968
Have you seen anyone suspicious lately?

914
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,719
Outsiders like you.

915
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,098
We're not going home until we catch him.

916
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,683
This investigation is going to be tricky.

917
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,518
What are you doing?

918
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,436
You can't just sit by
when people are dying.

919
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,981
Stay away. It's dangerous.

920
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,983
He just went into emergency surgery.

921
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,067
Who on earth did this?

922
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,777
Did you see anything?

923
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,029
We have to catch the culprit.

924
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,197
Let's go, Bong Bong.

925
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,490
Moon Jang-yeol.

926
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,325
We better kill him.

927
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,119
Detective Moon!

928
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,830
Help!

929
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:41,711
