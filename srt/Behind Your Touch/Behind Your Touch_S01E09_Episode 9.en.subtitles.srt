00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:52,385
The 21st National Assembly Election
will be held nationwide today.

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,723
The National Election Commission
is predicting that the results will be out

4
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,600
by 10:30 p.m. in some of the districts…

5
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,934
Hello, sir.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,061
You're here early.

7
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,979
Yes, I see that you're here early too.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,147
Yes.

9
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,609
You look a little haggard today though.

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,444
-Do I?
-Didn't you sleep well?

11
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,990
He was on pins and needles all night,
worried that Ju-man might not be elected.

12
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,910
You should have just slept in.

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,913
Everyone in this neighborhood
will be voting for Assemblyman Cha.

14
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,874
-That's a relief to hear.
-Right.

15
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,918
-Please go ahead.
-No, please.

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,544
SEONJI-MYEON, POLLING STATION 3

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,380
My goodness, here comes Assemblyman Cha.

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,761
-Congratulations!
-Have a good day, ma'am.

19
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,434
-You're the best.
-Mr. Kim.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,645
Aren't you voting?

21
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,731
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,859
There's no one I want to vote for.

23
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,530
I'll think it over.

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,250
Have a good day.

25
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,418
-Cha Ju-man!
-Hello, sir.

26
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,419
Hello, Dr. Jung.

27
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,463
Ju-man!

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,716
-Good luck.
-Yes, thank you.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,968
-Auntie.
-Yes?

30
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,010
Where's Ye-bun?

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,595
She left home early this morning.

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,098
Thank you.

33
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,315
So what's going to happen to those two?

34
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,569
It's true that they committed
obstruction of justice,

35
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,905
but it wasn't too serious.

36
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,742
But then it's not like
what they did had no effect at all.

37
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,369
It's an awkward situation.

38
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,289
But with cases like this,

39
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,876
don't the police usually let people go,
saying, "I'm glad you're safe?"

40
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,837
Yes, but not that guy.

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,006
He's totally heartless.

42
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,633
-Does he seem like he's ever been in love?
-No way.

43
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,845
He can't relate to them the way we can.

44
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,555
Plus, what's today?

45
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,514
Election day.

46
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,891
That's right.

47
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,144
He could've waited until
the election was over to arrest them.

48
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,980
Of course.
Every citizen has the right to vote.

49
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,316
Do you know what he is?

50
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,775
He's a small-minded jerk.

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,570
Should I arrest you two
for obstruction of justice too?

52
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,572
Can you be quiet?

53
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,656
-Yes.
-Okay.

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,534
Detective Moon is a nutjob
who keeps his word.

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,828
-How did you know?
-For crying out loud.

56
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,872
-Let's talk outside.
-Okay.

57
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,498
Have you eaten yet?

58
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,468
"Cho Ae-ran conspired with Jeon Gwang-sik
and faked her death

59
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,304
to avoid paying back her debt
at Mujin Coffee Shop."

60
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,764
Is that right?

61
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,391
Yes.

62
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,559
Wait, Detective Moon.

63
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,728
Ae-ran didn't do anything wrong.

64
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,064
She only did as I suggested.

65
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,774
No, Detective Moon.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,777
If it weren't for me,

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,071
Gwang-sik wouldn't have
done something like this.

68
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,579
You won't be charged
with criminal conspiracy

69
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,914
since there was no actual crime.

70
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,832
But you obstructed police business

71
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,335
since an investigation
opened for your case.

72
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,087
So that would be obstruction of justice.

73
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:20,843
But it's not like you posed any danger,
used threats, or resisted arrest.

74
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,013
So a good attorney might be
able to get you off the hook.

75
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,227
Are you going to get yourselves
a good attorney?

76
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,814
Of course, yes.

77
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,316
That's not good.

78
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,903
But you'll still be charged
with a misdemeanor.

79
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,447
What happens with that?

80
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,950
You'll be granted a summary judgment
and be fined.

81
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,537
Thank you so much.

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,705
Thank you.

83
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,581
It's still a crime.
Reflect on what you did.

84
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,583
-Of course.
-We will.

85
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,544
We'll be sure to reflect on it. Yes.

86
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,004
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

87
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,266
Dr. Bong, have you heard
anything about Ae-ran?

88
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,231
You're here.

89
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,693
Do you drink green tea?

90
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,112
-Yes, thank you.
-Have a seat.

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,910
We found Ae-ran.

92
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,495
What? Really?

93
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,083
She's safe, right?

94
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,919
Yes, she's safe and sound.

95
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,381
Apparently, she faked her death
with Gwang-sik

96
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,675
so she could escape from the coffee shop.

97
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,886
Thank goodness.

98
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,847
I was worried
something terrible happened to her.

99
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,394
It seems like she has a good friend.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,189
Where's Ae-ran right now?

101
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,775
She's at the police station
with Gwang-sik.

102
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,261
-Gwang-sik!
-What are you doing?

103
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,638
What on earth are you doing?

104
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,057
Come with us quietly.

105
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,227
Or else your boyfriend
will get beaten up as well.

106
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,187
This is illegal.

107
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,356
Go ahead and file a report then.

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,442
Ae-ran, what do you say? File a report.

109
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,446
Let's behave, all right?

110
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,449
Gwang-sik, I'll be in touch!

111
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,367
Ae-ran!

112
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,619
What are you doing? Come along.

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,257
How dare you run away?

114
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,051
I can't believe Gwang-sik.

115
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,303
He still likes you
when he knows your past?

116
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,097
Hey, Kim!

117
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,308
Watch this skank closely,
and send Ji-suk for deliveries.

118
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,695
Ji-suk.

119
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,329
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

120
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,497
Gwang-sik.

121
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,624
Did you tell her?

122
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,377
Why did you do it? Why did you tell her?

123
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,795
Sorry?

124
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,757
Ae-ran was taken by her boss
because you told Ji-suk about her!

125
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,259
Ji-suk?

126
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,052
That can't be.

127
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,430
Ji-suk was very worried about Ae-ran.

128
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,016
Dr. Bong, you were fooled.

129
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,185
She's on her boss' side.

130
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,440
MUJIN COFFEE SHOP

131
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,072
Why did you do it?

132
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,200
I told you about Ae-ran
because I trusted you.

133
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,118
Why did you tell your boss?

134
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,704
If Ae-ran runs away,

135
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,582
I have to pay back her debt in her place.

136
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,292
The same goes for Ae-ran.

137
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,211
We stood joint surety for each other.

138
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,005
You were worried about Ae-ran.

139
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,715
That was real.

140
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,468
Yes, I was really worried about her.

141
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,095
"What if she was killed
by the serial killer?"

142
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,556
But that's not what happened.

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,808
She ran away to save herself,

144
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,229
knowing I'd have to pay her debt
if she did.

145
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,147
So why should I protect her?

146
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,278
We can pay off all your debts,
yours and Ae-ran's.

147
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,113
I'll help however I can.

148
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,202
Some debts can't be paid back with money.

149
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,163
Get out of my way. I'm busy.

150
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,012
Do you have a minute?

151
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,347
Can we meet up?

152
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,185
There must have been a misunderstanding.

153
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,689
What I did that day
was a duty performed as a detective.

154
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,856
Nothing more.

155
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,277
I see.

156
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,031
It won't happen again.

157
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,157
Goodbye.

158
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,670
Got a minute?

159
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,382
I was just about to go and see you.

160
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,383
Good.

161
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,051
How are your teeth?

162
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,971
Are any of them loose?

163
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,306
The hell are you talking about?

164
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,478
If you ever lay a finger
on Hyeon-ok again,

165
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,771
I'll actually kill you.

166
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,648
When have I ever laid a finger on her?

167
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,358
That was before we got divorced.

168
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,485
Right, I'm doing
what I couldn't back then.

169
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,112
Who do you think you are?

170
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,697
Me? I'm Won Jong-muk.

171
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,117
Someone who loved her
thousands of times more than you ever did.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,078
Wait, were you two seeing each other
behind my back?

173
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,080
Is that why we got divorced?

174
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,666
I recommend the dentist's office

175
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,294
above the convenience store
at the intersection.

176
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,756
You're going to need some implants.

177
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,965
Hey, wait!

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,510
You're going to get it, just wait and see!

179
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,847
Damn it.

180
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,275
Was it still a misunderstanding?

181
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,493
-There goes our shaman!
-Oh, my.

182
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,286
-Come over here.
-Come sit with us.

183
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,163
Sit with us.

184
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,210
Who do you think will be
our national assemblyman this time?

185
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,338
I mean, you've been on a roll lately.

186
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,173
I'm sure you can see it all.

187
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,342
I do see it, but…

188
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,803
But?

189
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,474
The general tells me he's thirsty.

190
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,393
He is?

191
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,478
Then what would you like?

192
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,063
Water?

193
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,523
-Coffee?
-Coffee.

194
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,025
-Okay.
-Go bring some.

195
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,443
Hold up!

196
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,654
I'm sorry. It's just that…

197
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,242
He wants to have coffee

198
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,286
someplace nice
where they have comfortable couches.

199
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,746
Right.

200
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,499
He's a five-star general after all.

201
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,961
He shouldn't have coffee
at a shabby place like this.

202
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,339
Hey, bring us some nice coffee.

203
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,845
So?

204
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,181
Any idea who'll be the next assemblyman?

205
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,687
The general knows everything.

206
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,986
I can see a face.

207
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,864
I see the golden badge.

208
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,330
Come on.

209
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,749
So what is the general telling you?

210
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,626
Is it Assemblyman Cha?

211
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,752
Is it someone else?

212
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,465
Why would you ask him?

213
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,009
Look at Ae-ran over there.

214
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,554
She's alive and in one piece.

215
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,310
Why is she alive?

216
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,147
Were you hoping she was dead?

217
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,441
Of course not.

218
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,323
-It's hot.
-For Pete's sake!

219
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,866
Could we have some napkins?

220
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,867
It's fine.

221
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,163
I have napkins.

222
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:19,340
This damned thing
was a lot more expensive than napkins,

223
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,218
but it's not nearly as absorbent.

224
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,553
Powers, my foot.

225
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,932
What a load of bull.

226
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,893
Hello.

227
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,895
-Hi.
-Hi.

228
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,481
Two coffees for Mujin Realtors.

229
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,619
Why do you keep following me?

230
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,372
The neighborhood
is pretty dangerous these days.

231
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,415
I wanted to walk you home.

232
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,501
Don't you know who I am?

233
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,336
I'm Bae Ok-hui from Mujin Girls' High.

234
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,506
Da-eun said
I have to protect you at all costs.

235
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,174
-She said that?
-Yes.

236
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,969
She said you saved her
when she almost died.

237
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,435
Who took 23,000 won from Ye-bun?
She was supposed to buy workbooks.

238
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,938
Are you Bae Ok-hui from Mujin Girls' High?

239
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,815
So it was you.

240
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,942
I'll give you a beating worth 23,000 won.

241
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,653
What a lunatic.

242
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:23,988
Get her!

243
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,580
Take that, and that, and that!

244
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,009
Let go.

245
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,218
I said, let go!

246
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,220
-You want me to let go?
-Let go.

247
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,014
No, don't let go!

248
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,599
-Don't!
-Is that how you plead?

249
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,142
Please don't let go.

250
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,476
Please don't let go, sis.

251
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,063
That was nothing.

252
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,398
I'm fine. You can go.

253
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,567
No, Da-eun said
I have to protect you at all--

254
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,027
Come on!

255
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,820
-Is her word law?
-I mean…

256
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,114
Why are you so intimidated
by your little sister?

257
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,117
It's not just because of Da-eun.

258
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,289
I want to protect you, sis.

259
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,374
What?

260
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,071
-Jong-muk.
-Yes?

261
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,366
How about you get married
and divorced real quick?

262
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,702
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,955
I mean,

264
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,541
I'm divorced,
but you've never been married.

265
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,086
I feel like you're getting
the short end of the stick.

266
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,339
That's why you brought me
all the way out here?

267
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,259
Well, not really.

268
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,304
I wanted some fresh air too.

269
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,477
Jong-muk, do you want some ice cream?

270
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,145
I can't.

271
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,939
I'm diabetic.

272
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,527
Then do you want some coffee?

273
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,571
I'm going through male menopause.
I can't sleep if I drink coffee.

274
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,532
You too?

275
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,956
We wasted all that precious time,

276
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
and now we're old.

277
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,171
I'm old.

278
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,132
You're still the same.

279
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,595
I'm old too.

280
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,888
No, you're not.

281
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,309
What do you want to do now?

282
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,770
I'm not sure.

283
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,940
In that case, we can hold hands.

284
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,409
You're nervous, aren't you?

285
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,578
You're shaking just for holding my hand.

286
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,121
No.

287
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,375
That's not it. My blood sugar's dropping.

288
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,961
I should have had that ice cream.

289
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,131
You can't even open this? My gosh.

290
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,758
Goodness.

291
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:31,675
Here.

292
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,593
One more.

293
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:38,807
Have another one.

294
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,146
-Candidate number one, Cha Ju-man!
-Candidate number one, Cha Ju-man!

295
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,024
-Candidate number one, Cha Ju-man!
-Candidate number one, Cha Ju-man!

296
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,111
-How do you think this election will go?
-What kind of results are you expecting?

297
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,158
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

298
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:01,288
I will now humbly wait
for the decision of the citizens of Mujin.

299
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,790
Thank you.

300
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,875
A word for your opponent please.

301
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,294
I wish him good luck.

302
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,522
A bottle of soju
and a rolled omelet, please.

303
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,648
Coming right up.

304
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
My goodness.

305
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,485
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,697
Dr. Bong.

307
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,783
Seon-woo.

308
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,669
You seemed to be a lightweight.

310
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,422
I get drunk quickly
and sober up quickly too.

311
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,427
Is everything all right?

312
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,931
You're drinking by yourself at this hour.

313
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,978
I'm just a little upset, that's all.

314
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,983
Would you mind if I asked what happened?

315
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,526
Not at all.

316
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,117
I just can't seem to figure people out.

317
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,204
That's the hardest thing in the world.

318
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,248
To truly know people.

319
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,045
ANALYSIS OF CAMPAIGN PLEDGES

320
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,840
What do you think he's like?

321
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,261
Mr. Cha?

322
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,347
He's a good man. This I'm sure of.

323
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,145
You know,

324
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,732
everyone has a little evil inside.

325
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,984
Sorry?

326
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,572
There's always more than meets the eye.

327
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,116
So don't trust people too easily.

328
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,960
I still want to.

329
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,672
Even if they're not who they seem to be,

330
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:21,011
it's easier to trust people
than to be suspicious of everyone.

331
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,805
Then…

332
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,475
do you trust me too?

333
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,768
Of course.

334
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,686
I trust you, Seon-woo.

335
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,355
You're a good person too.

336
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,649
I stand by it 100%.

337
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,526
Thank you for saying that.

338
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,445
It's true.

339
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,031
I'm not just saying that.

340
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,659
Do you want me to prove that I trust you?

341
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,705
I'll let you in on a secret.

342
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,208
I…

343
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,628
have a special power.

344
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,629
Do you want to know?

345
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,047
No.

346
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
Don't tell me.

347
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,052
Don't trust me either.

348
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,596
You don't know how I could change.

349
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,352
Ask me if you ever get curious,

350
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,104
and I'll tell you.

351
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,464
It's Ye-bun!

352
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,362
Ma'am, I was with someone.
Do you know where she went?

353
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,115
She left just a second ago.

354
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,264
I'm back.

355
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,187
What are you doing?

356
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,564
I'm going on a delivery.

357
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,858
Who said you could?

358
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,652
Ji-suk's been out on delivery all day.

359
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,822
I won't run away.

360
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,325
If I do, you can catch me and sell me off.

361
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,035
What about Gwang-sik?

362
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,662
I'm not meeting him.

363
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,042
I was using him.
I never liked him or anything like that.

364
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,044
All right.

365
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,463
I'll give you a second chance.

366
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926
Don't pretend you care about me.

367
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,354
I'm here to apologize.

368
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,940
Apologize?

369
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,109
I understand how you feel.

370
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,403
I would have been resentful too
if I were you.

371
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,782
But you were sincerely worried

372
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,577
when Ae-ran went missing.

373
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,663
I know that's how you
really feel about her.

374
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,206
I want to help you.

375
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,501
I told you. You can't help us.

376
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,503
No, I can really help you.

377
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,713
You can try all you want.

378
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,093
-What are you doing?
-I'm coming with you.

379
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,179
You're busy, so we'll talk on the way.

380
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,389
Seriously?

381
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,032
I'll wait here.

382
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,705
MUJIN FISHING AREA

383
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,264
You're really something.

384
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,724
All right.

385
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,101
Let's hear what this is about.

386
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,689
It looks nice over there.

387
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,733
Let's talk over there.

388
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,818
Thank you.

389
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,581
Ji-suk!

390
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,292
What the…

391
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,238
What happened?

392
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,491
Ji-suk!

393
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,284
Ji-suk!

394
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,620
Ji-suk!

395
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,413
What's going on?

396
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,214
Ji-suk.

397
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,948
Please.

398
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,837
Are you all right? Quickly.

399
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,202
This way. Be careful.

400
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,378
Wait here.

401
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,429
Let me see your shoulder.

402
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,769
The wound on your shoulder
isn't that serious,

403
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,312
but I think your ankle's broken.

404
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,732
Did you see the attacker's face?

405
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,318
No, I didn't.

406
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,366
Ji-suk, excuse me for a second.

407
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,243
Okay.

408
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,184
I think we should call the police first.

409
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,446
Hold on for a bit.

410
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,326
I make house calls here,
so I know this place well.

411
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,412
It's secluded,
so people don't know about it.

412
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,247
He won't be able to find you here.

413
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,665
I'll go and get people…

414
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,461
Someone we can trust.

415
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,129
Hide here until I come back.

416
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,505
Okay.

417
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,678
I'm sorry.

418
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,889
Please tell Ae-ran I'm sorry too.

419
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,559
Later.

420
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,227
Tell her yourself later.

421
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,022
I'll be right back.

422
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,022
Excuse me.

423
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,735
Dr. Bong.

424
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,612
What happened?

425
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,781
Please, help me.

426
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,907
I…

427
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,993
The culprit is definitely
a Mujin resident.

428
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,835
Dr. Bong?

429
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,975
The results of the 2022

430
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,352
-National Assembly Election are out.
-The results are out!

431
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,980
-They're out!
-First, Mujin of Chungcheongnam-do.

432
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,064
Congratulations.

433
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,191
Candidate number one, Cha Ju-man.

434
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,699
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

435
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,784
-Cha Ju-man!
-You won, Mr. Cha!

436
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,244
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

437
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,579
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

438
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,082
-We did it!
-Cha Ju-man!

439
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,088
Cha Ju-man!

440
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,507
Control the traffic.

441
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,719
NO. 1 CHA JU-MAN

442
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,928
Hey.

443
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,763
It's going to get chaotic soon,

444
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,724
-so control the traffic.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,559
Send most of the vehicles that way.

446
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,102
-To the right.
-Yes, sir.

447
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,562
He'll be coming out any minute.

448
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,773
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

449
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,320
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

450
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,740
Goodness, thank you for your hard work.

451
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,329
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

452
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,957
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

453
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,168
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

454
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,086
-Thank you.
-Cha Ju-man!

455
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,923
-Hey, Ye-bun.
-I will never forget your support.

456
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,467
What happened to your face?

457
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,010
Dr. Jung.

458
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,887
Dr. Jung.

459
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,556
What happened to you?

460
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,975
I'll tell you later.

461
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,354
Ye-bun, you're bleeding.
Let's get you to the hospital.

462
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,480
I…

463
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,648
Later.

464
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,776
Have you seen Detective Moon?

465
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,236
Wait, what happened?

466
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,738
Look at all this blood.

467
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,573
Where's Detective Moon?

468
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,117
-He went back to the station.
-The station…

469
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,956
Are you okay?

470
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,123
Yes, I'm okay.

471
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,669
I'm sorry, Seon-woo.
I don't have time to lose.

472
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,254
Dr. Bong, your phone!

473
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,513
Detective Moon!

474
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,975
What's going on?

475
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,935
Come quickly. Ji-suk's in danger.

476
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,436
-What?
-I saw it.

477
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,438
The rain poncho guy tried to kill her.

478
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,482
She's already pretty hurt.

479
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,609
And you're the only person I can trust.

480
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,445
I hid her somewhere no one can find her.

481
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,119
Captain, the rain poncho killer
has been spotted.

482
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,329
I'm heading over to the scene right now.

483
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,914
What? The rain poncho killer?

484
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,627
Are you saying Dr. Bong saw him?

485
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,380
You shouldn't be going there by yourself.

486
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,383
Don't do anything reckless and stay put.

487
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,634
I'll be right there.

488
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,479
-Is this it?
-Yes.

489
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,607
Ji-suk.

490
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,578
Ji-suk.

491
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,928
This is the third victim.

492
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,555
The murder weapon is indisputable,

493
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,725
and Dr. Bong witnessed the rain poncho,
so there's no doubt about it.

494
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:24,187
Kim Si-a, Park Seung-gil, and Lee Ji-suk.

495
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,691
Look into what the victims had in common.

496
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,650
Yes, sir.

497
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,577
It's not Gwang-sik.

498
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,371
Yeah?

499
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,498
He's been drinking since the afternoon.

500
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,711
You said you touched the victim's butt.

501
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,713
Tell me more about what you saw.

502
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,843
The rain poncho killer
attacked the motorcycle Ji-suk was riding.

503
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,054
He tried to stab her with a knife,
but he luckily missed her.

504
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,722
And Ji-suk ran away.

505
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,183
But then the killer
caught her again soon after

506
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,103
and put a cable tie around Ji-suk's wrist.

507
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,062
A cable tie?

508
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,356
He tied his and Ji-suk's wrists
together with it.

509
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,775
I hurt my hand trying to cut it off.

510
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,488
But how did the killer know
where you two were?

511
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,073
That's what I'm wondering too.

512
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,491
We had definitely lost him,

513
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,493
and it wasn't a place
he could easily find.

514
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,913
And I didn't tell anyone about it
until I saw you.

515
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,373
There's no way he could have known.

516
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,625
You can never be sure.

517
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,504
Maybe he has a way to find things out
even if you don't tell him.

518
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,047
How?

519
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,675
What if the killer

520
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,803
has powers like you and Jeon Gwang-sik?

521
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,221
What?

522
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
Never mind. What am I saying?

523
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,061
There's someone else who's also psychic.

524
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:29,979
What?

525
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,190
Gwang-sik said
there was another person there

526
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,233
when we were hit by the meteor shower.

527
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,235
He saw that person when he touched my leg.

528
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,445
So who was it?

529
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,532
It seems like Gwang-sik
only saw his silhouette.

530
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,744
If he's the killer,

531
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,705
he probably saw your memories.

532
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,708
And that's how he found out
where Ji-suk was.

533
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:51,626
What?

534
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,421
You probably ran into him
on your way to me after hiding the victim.

535
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,383
I ran into him?

536
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,387
Dr. Bong. What happened?

537
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,223
-Cha Ju-man!
-Cha Ju-man!

538
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,433
Hey, Ye-bun.

539
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,060
Dr. Jung.

540
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,437
What happened to you?

541
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,899
Ye-bun, you're bleeding.
Let's get you to the hospital.

542
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,484
Oh, God. Look at all this blood.

543
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,568
Where's Detective Moon?

544
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,111
He went back to the station.

545
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,407
Are you okay?

546
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,077
The pieces are coming together now.

547
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,081
You don't know who he is,
but he knows about your power.

548
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,749
Really?

549
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,168
What is the killer most afraid of?

550
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,296
It's you.

551
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,675
Because you can see
all the crimes he's committed.

552
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:45,054
Then what can he do
to stop you from seeing what he's done?

553
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,641
You can only see things
someone has seen with their eyes.

554
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,309
Right.

555
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,520
Then there's only one thing

556
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,647
the killer can do.

557
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,693
Closing…

558
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,320
his eyes.

559
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,949
He was staggering
because he had his eyes closed.

560
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,327
He stabbed the victims randomly
also because his eyes were closed.

561
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,204
So he would have missed his aim a lot.

562
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,331
The blackouts.

563
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,501
There's something I see
every time I touch someone.

564
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,919
Blackouts.

565
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,297
I thought they were created naturally

566
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,633
when people closed their eyes
or fell asleep.

567
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,885
But someone could have
created them on purpose.

568
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,307
After he let Park Seung-gil slip through,
his method evolved.

569
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,266
The cable tie.

570
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,145
It keeps the victim close to him,
helping him to aim better.

571
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,524
I'm sure of it.

572
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,026
The killer is psychic.

573
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,740
Let's get you to a hospital first.

574
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,667
We're back to square one.

575
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:00,504
The people who had blackouts
are all potentially the killer.

576
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,882
All right, let's compile a list.

577
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,509
Was there anyone suspicious
among the people you ran into

578
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,886
on your way to me?

579
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:09,597
I'm not sure.

580
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,723
Name them one by one.

581
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,850
Who did you meet first?

582
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,062
Dr. Bong.

583
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,939
-Mr. Park.
-The shaman.

584
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,193
He's so good at conning people.
I don't really trust him.

585
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,570
Yeah? Could he be the killer?

586
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,155
No, he can't be.

587
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,948
-Why not?
-His family is abroad.

588
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,202
The reason why he conned me
was to support his son.

589
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,204
Such a good dad
couldn't have done such a thing.

590
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,706
Who did you meet next?

591
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,918
TRUSTWORTHY: SHAMAN, OK-HUI'S DAD,
ASSEMBLYMAN CHA, GRANDPA, CAPTAIN WON…

592
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,795
What about Kim Seon-woo?

593
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,089
Seon-woo…

594
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,676
-can't be the killer.
-Again? Why not?

595
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,887
Because he told me not to trust him.

596
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,014
Maybe he did that on purpose.

597
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,266
He wouldn't have said that
if he was the killer.

598
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,769
The killer can't be a good dad,
someone you've known for long,

599
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,270
a family member, or a detective?

600
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,106
This won't get us anywhere.

601
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,817
I really don't suspect
any of these people.

602
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,446
Anyway, we have our suspects now.

603
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,615
All you have to do is touch them.

604
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,700
With this hand?

605
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,828
No, you can't in that condition.

606
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,204
Then what?

607
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,289
Jeon Gwang-sik.

608
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,874
Gwang-sik?

609
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,585
But you saw him earlier.

610
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,796
-He's totally--
-We'll fix him up.

611
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,634
CAN MUJIN BE A SPECIAL TOURIST ZONE?

612
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,719
MUJIN REDEVELOPMENT SCANDAL,
YOON DEOK-HYEON'S CONFIDANT TESTIFIES

613
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,048
Here you go, sir.

614
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,675
You must be busy.

615
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,095
-I'm sorry to interrupt your work.
-Not at all, sir.

616
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,807
I'm sorry that this is all
I can serve you at the moment.

617
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,560
There's an ongoing case right now,

618
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,896
so I can't treat you to something nicer.

619
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,105
Don't worry about it.

620
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,775
To be honest,

621
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,280
this is why I'm here.

622
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,284
What is this?

623
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,748
It's a case I've been investigating
for a long time.

624
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:45,586
I don't think I'll be able to
investigate it anymore,

625
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,756
so I came here to ask you to take it on.

626
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,511
If you keep digging into it,

627
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,222
you'll probably come across
someone you know.

628
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,310
And another thing.

629
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,312
Sure, please go ahead.

630
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,274
It's shameless of me to ask this,

631
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,818
but please

632
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,488
take good care of Hyeon-ok.

633
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,247
Wait.

634
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,957
Are you leaving already?

635
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,626
-Sir, wait.
-No, it's fine.

636
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,336
All right then.

637
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,338
Take care, sir.

638
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,718
CAN MUJIN BE A SPECIAL TOURIST ZONE?

639
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,018
ASSEMBLYMAN YOON DEOK-HYEON
ELECTED FOR A THIRD TERM!

640
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,193
Isn't that Assemblyman Cha?

641
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,488
What is he doing there?

642
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,740
-Sir.
-Hello, sir.

643
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,873
Assemblyman Cha,
congratulations on your election.

644
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,503
Good afternoon.

645
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,677
I heard another murder
took place yesterday.

646
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,888
Yes, the victim was Lee Ji-suk,
27 years old.

647
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,349
She was an employee
at the Mujin Coffee Shop.

648
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,643
She fell victim to the serial killer.

649
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,811
Well…

650
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,522
Are you 100% certain

651
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,983
that these are serial murders?

652
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,864
Yes, so…

653
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,909
The methods of operation are similar,
and the weapon is also the same.

654
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,536
Even so,

655
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,582
I feel like you're jumping to conclusions.

656
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:52,963
With all due respect, what do you mean?

657
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,094
This is Mujin we're talking about.

658
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,473
A safe and unpolluted city
with clean water and nice people.

659
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,100
It's just like an oasis.

660
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,810
Yes, that's right.

661
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:11,857
If news were to spread nationwide
that there's a serial killer in Mujin…

662
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,194
Just think of what that would do
to our image.

663
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,406
You're not wrong.

664
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,201
But as the police,

665
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:25,079
we can't just dismiss something

666
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,415
when it's clearly there.

667
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,047
It would be best

668
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,008
to investigate

669
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,679
in a more discreet manner.

670
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,932
We don't want this to leak to the press.

671
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,184
Yes, sir.

672
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,978
We'll proceed in a discreet manner.

673
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,734
The chief of police is here.

674
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,533
I'm counting on you, Captain.

675
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,827
Yes, sir.

676
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,043
Goodbye, sir.

677
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,965
Would you take a look at him?

678
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,886
He's become a full-on politician
now that he's in office.

679
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:35,858
You're back.

680
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,484
The police came by, didn't they?

681
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,402
Yes.

682
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,405
I'm losing my mind over here!

683
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,074
Not only did they hold me at the station,

684
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,659
but they also keep pestering us here.

685
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,786
Who would come here now?

686
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,539
I wouldn't, it feels like bad luck!

687
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,167
You.

688
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,128
You know you have to pay back
Ji-suk's debt now, right?

689
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,546
I'm sorry?

690
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,716
You're the guarantor no matter the case.

691
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,051
So you have to pay it back.

692
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,682
MUJIN COFFEE SHOP

693
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,948
Welcome.

694
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,328
What brings you here again, Detective?

695
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,831
I told them everything I know
at the police station.

696
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,376
How are we supposed to
conduct our business

697
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,920
when you keep intruding like this?

698
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,881
I'm not here to investigate
Ji-suk's murder.

699
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,257
Are you here for coffee then?

700
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,467
I'm here to pay back the debt.

701
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,676
What?

702
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,055
I'm here to pay back Ae-ran's debt.

703
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:48,972
DEBT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FORM

704
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,098
DEBTOR: CHO AE-RAN
GUARANTOR: MOON JANG-YEOL

705
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,686
I didn't loan her money
for her to pay it back.

706
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,815
Sure, I know.
I won't be paying you back with money.

707
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,651
You're supposed to work off
your debts here, right?

708
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,238
Welcome.

709
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,913
-Who are you?
-I'm an employee here,

710
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,039
obviously.

711
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,668
You ready to order?

712
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,128
What will you have?

713
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,590
A cup of coffee, please.

714
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,758
Coffee it is.

715
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,343
And you?

716
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,388
I'll also have a cup of coffee, please.

717
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,681
Okay, two coffees.

718
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,057
How much creamer and sugar?

719
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,934
Two spoons of each, please.

720
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,063
The classic recipe. All right.

721
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,649
Coming right up, sweeties.

722
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,986
We'll just come back some other time.

723
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:47,864
-Yes, we'll come back.
-Wait!

724
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,747
Mujin Coffee Shop.

725
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,583
The billiard hall at the intersection?

726
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,960
Four cups of coffee.

727
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,336
All right.

728
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,966
Hey, which one of you is Jokester?

729
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,511
That would be me.

730
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,282
What is this about?

731
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,785
Here's your coffee.

732
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,295
I'm in a rush, so hurry up and chug it.

733
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,303
It's hot.

734
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,597
CONFIRMATION OF DEBT PAYMENT

735
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,515
CREDITOR: KIM SEON-HWA
DEBTOR: CHO AE-RAN

736
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,518
The money will be wired to you.

737
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,354
If you bother her again,

738
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,898
I'll be treating you
as a criminal suspect.

739
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,275
I'm cutting you some slack now,

740
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,277
but that stops once you're my suspect.

741
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,363
Let's go, Ms. Cho.

742
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,951
I'm sick of you anyway, so get lost.

743
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,372
Did you just insult her?

744
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,665
That would be defamation.

745
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,168
Thank you for working here,

746
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,629
and let's never see each other again.

747
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,684
What do you plan on doing from now on?

748
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,937
I'm not sure yet.

749
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,855
Why don't you go to Mr. Jeon Gwang-sik?

750
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,566
He seems like a good person.

751
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,818
I can't.

752
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,779
I'm not good enough for him.

753
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,198
I have an embarrassing past too.

754
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,452
He probably knows
about everything already.

755
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,622
No, there's no way he knows.

756
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,710
He knows about everything.

757
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,211
What?

758
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:16,972
Ae-ran.

759
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,731
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

760
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,880
You have to pay for that umbrella!

761
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,596
Are you going to follow me around again?

762
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,890
Yes. I have to protect you, sis.

763
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,393
I have somewhere to be today.

764
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,270
I'll follow you around quietly.

765
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,315
Whatever.

766
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:09,941
Suit yourself.

767
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:07,958
Oh no!

768
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,175
Seon-woo.

769
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,886
Are you all right?

770
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:21,930
Yes.

771
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,016
I'm here to return your phone.

772
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,727
I wondered where it was.

773
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,403
The snack stall over there
makes good udon.

774
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:40,156
Do you want to go and have udon with me?

775
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,908
Udon?

776
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,119
I was just craving udon.

777
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,333
Don't forget. You're the next target.

778
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,797
You're going to die.

779
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:02,262
I'm actually not feeling well today.

780
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,765
Let's have that udon next time.

781
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,476
Okay.

782
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,895
Next time then.

783
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,816
Get some rest.

784
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,817
Thank you.

785
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,535
What? I'm telling you, you'll die.

786
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,623
Why, that little…

787
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,877
Hello?

788
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,086
Detective Moon,

789
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,546
I'm going to see a doctor.

790
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,214
So?

791
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,050
I thought you might as well drive me--

792
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,761
I don't have time for that.
Just be careful on your way.

793
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,805
Darn it.

794
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,934
You got your tetanus shot, right?

795
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:49,851
Yes.

796
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,812
We'll have to wait a few more days
to remove the stitches.

797
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,106
Be careful not to get water on it.

798
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,609
And avoid using this hand if you can.

799
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,487
Okay. Thank you.

800
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,744
What are you doing here?

801
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,079
How did you find me?

802
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,706
What did the doctor say?
Will it heal soon?

803
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,792
He said it'll take some time.

804
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,295
You followed me here, didn't you?

805
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,213
Why?

806
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,715
Were you worried about me?

807
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,716
No.

808
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,552
I thought the killer would show up
if he saw you were alone.

809
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,012
You were kind of

810
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,056
the bait.

811
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,978
This is why you got dumped
in 11th grade and bawled your eyes out.

812
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,688
No one wants to be with cold-hearted guys.

813
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,743
The car's this way.

814
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,648
That's not it.

815
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,526
You have to use wider strokes at first.

816
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,069
I'm doing the best I can.

817
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,156
Don't paint outside the nail.

818
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,160
By the way,

819
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,288
why do I have to do this?

820
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,585
So that other psychic person
is the serial killer?

821
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,836
Yes.

822
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,464
We need your help to catch him.

823
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,507
My help?

824
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,759
We need your psychometric power.

825
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,262
Dr. Bong can't use her hand right now.

826
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,435
All you need to do is find out
which Mujin resident is psychic.

827
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,313
I'll help however I can.

828
00:55:58,897 --> 00:55:59,939
Good.

829
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,024
Then first,

830
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,234
touch Dr. Bong.

831
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,527
-Okay.
-Excuse me?

832
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,447
Why me?

833
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,824
You saw the other guy
on the night of the meteor shower.

834
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,493
We should check one more time.

835
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,495
There might be some clues left.

836
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,914
You're right.

837
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,916
I saw him too briefly last time.

838
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,879
But if we do this, he'll see all my…

839
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,635
Then let me have
a quick word with him first.

840
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,053
Sure.

841
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,055
Just the two of us.

842
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,020
My gosh.

843
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,570
Skip everything
from my 10th grade to 12th grade.

844
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,572
Especially skip the memories
of the boy in the church choir.

845
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,949
Valentine's Day
in 11th grade is off-limits.

846
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,200
The part where I climb over the fence…

847
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,952
Just skip everything
from my teenage years.

848
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,537
I asked a guy out in college,

849
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,414
but I had terrible eyesight back then.

850
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:01,543
And I only cried
when that bastard dumped me

851
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,753
because I remembered a sad movie,
not because--

852
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,671
Just saying…

853
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:09,259
But it won't matter whether I see those
since you've already told me everything.

854
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,510
Aren't you getting tired?

855
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,763
Anyway, don't watch everything.

856
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,473
You have to stick to that day, okay?

857
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,225
Okay.

858
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,436
I won't watch anything that seems private.

859
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,523
I'll touch you now.

860
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,239
I can definitely see better.

861
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,782
Right?

862
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,868
Taking care of your hands
brings amazing results.

863
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,705
Then I'll touch you for a bit longer now.

864
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,134
Are you just getting home?

865
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,556
I'm home.

866
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:04,481
She's Geumsil.

867
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,699
So? Did you see him?

868
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,784
Just out of curiosity…

869
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,871
Why are you and your grandfather
so awkward like that?

870
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,917
It seems that you're not on great terms.

871
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,628
Why don't you talk it out with him?

872
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:30,048
I told you not to watch anything else.

873
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,802
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

874
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,432
So? Did you find anything?

875
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,270
I did see something iffy.

876
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,314
Yeah? What is it?

877
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,776
At the time,

878
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,695
Dr. Bong and I were here
inside the cattle shed.

879
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,990
And the silhouette was over there,
behind that pillar away from the shed.

880
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,701
When Geumsil lit up,

881
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,663
he was watching from over there,
like this.

882
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,623
From what I saw,

883
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,792
he reached about here.

884
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,003
Yes, he seemed to reach about here,
so he's average in height.

885
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:13,049
It means he's taller than me
but shorter than Detective Moon.

886
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,843
And then his build…

887
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,888
From the way he fit within this,

888
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,724
he's definitely on the slim side.

889
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,688
Excellent.

890
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,481
I've never seen anyone
use their psychic powers

891
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,692
in such a progressive and proactive way.

892
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,735
So different from someone else I know.

893
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,248
I'll drop you off at your house.
You can take a break for now.

894
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,376
What?

895
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,421
Are you sad that you're being replaced?

896
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,464
Sad? As if.

897
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,133
I couldn't be happier.

898
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,010
Don't go wandering around.

899
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,887
Call me if you need to go somewhere.

900
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,056
Okay.

901
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,476
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

902
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,572
Out with the bad, in with the good.

903
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,952
Hello.

904
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,705
Where are you coming from?

905
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,207
I decorated my workshop,
and now I'm on my way to work.

906
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,917
How did the decoration go?

907
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,628
It's done now.

908
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,796
I'd love to see it.

909
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,673
Would you like to come over?

910
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,593
I haven't shown it to anyone yet.

911
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,346
Then will I be the first to see it?

912
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,849
If you come over, you will be.

913
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,143
When should I go?

914
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,396
How about when I get off work later?

915
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,482
Sounds good.

916
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,531
You did great today.
It was exhausting, wasn't it?

917
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,241
No, it was nothing.

918
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,536
I'm happy to help the police.
It's not exhausting at all.

919
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,664
By the way,

920
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,874
on the night of the meteor shower,

921
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:14,629
Dr. Bong and I got our powers
because we were touching Geumsil.

922
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:17,674
But the guy who was outside
wasn't touching Geumsil,

923
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:20,009
so maybe he didn't get any special power.

924
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,098
No, I'm sure he did.

925
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,893
I don't know how exactly,
but I'm certain he got the same power.

926
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,728
Is that right?

927
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,691
Then what does he have to do
to see everything?

928
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:42,949
Hello.

929
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,785
Hello, Detective Moon.

930
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,807
You're taller than Gwang-sik here
but shorter than me.

931
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,728
Yes, I guess I am.

932
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,899
I'll get going then.

933
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,703
He does seem similar
to the silhouette I saw.

934
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,292
Welcome.

935
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,293
Hi.

936
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,390
Has anyone bought cable ties recently?

937
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,309
I'm not sure.

938
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,852
No one bought them during my shifts.

939
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,522
Then what are the working hours
for the part-timer before you?

940
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,065
You mean Seon-woo?

941
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,484
From 1 p.m. to 9 p.m.

942
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,444
I see.

943
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,282
Did he work on the day
of the National Assembly Election?

944
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:10,578
No. He said he had plans,
so I covered his shift all day.

945
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,174
Where are you?

946
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,176
Home. Where else would I be?

947
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:26,761
Home where?

948
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,638
My room.

949
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,515
Your lights are off though.

950
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,183
I'm about to go to bed.

951
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:34,477
Yeah? Then turn them back on for me.

952
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,813
What? They're broken…

953
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,272
Where are you?

954
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,399
I dropped my phone in the toilet again!

955
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,402
NUTJOB

956
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,239
Do I have to report
every single thing to him?

957
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,366
Could that perv have gone to…

958
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,254
-Detective Moon.
-Is Mr. Kim inside?

959
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,923
No, he left to go to his workshop.

960
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:06,592
All right.

961
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,553
Is that a cat tower?

962
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,680
Yes, I'm making one.

963
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,182
It's so pretty.

964
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,401
So sturdy, too.

965
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,216
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

966
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,428
I heard the killer almost got you too.

967
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,804
What were you doing on the election day?

968
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,557
Do you think I'm the killer?

969
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,643
Let's just say
there is reasonable suspicion.

970
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,687
We're going to track down
the psychic on this day.

971
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,065
-Can everyone hear me?
-Yes.

972
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,359
We need to touch the killer
without letting him touch us.

973
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,444
Everyone's a suspect, understand?

974
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,238
The murders started happening
after he came to Mujin.

975
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,156
Beware of Kim Seon-woo.

976
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,783
Something about him feels off.

977
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,826
I have a feeling that something big
is going to go down today.

978
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,745
I'll really have to decline.

979
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:00,414
Maybe he's playing with you.

980
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,208
He'll start messing with
those around you first.

981
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,210
Those around me?

982
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,295
Ok-hui, can't you hear me?

983
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:12,343
