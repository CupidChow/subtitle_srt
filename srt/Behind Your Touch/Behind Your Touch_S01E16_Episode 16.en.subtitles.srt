1
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,004
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,554
You can't go in. What are you doing?

3
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,389
-Move!
-You can't go in there!

4
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,644
Where's Ok-hui?

5
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,481
Tell me where she is!

6
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,916
You can roughly understand
what's going on, right?

7
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,043
This is the end of my little hint.

8
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,797
You can't see, can you?

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,298
Of course, you can't.

10
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,674
I closed my eyes.

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,885
You're going to have
a hard time with this one.

12
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,226
I can't see it.

13
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
Here are the keys.

14
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,698
What are you doing?

15
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,867
Put that down.

16
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,912
This is the only way I can save Ok-hui.

17
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,039
We can find her,
so you don't have to do this.

18
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,374
Do you know where she is?

19
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,750
You don't.

20
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,627
At this rate, she's going to die.

21
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,005
Stay back.

22
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,679
I'm not joking around right now.

23
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,640
-What's your plan here?
-Don't get in my way.

24
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm taking him out of here.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,354
Move.

26
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,749
Detective Moon, get the car keys.

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,007
-You drive.
-Bong Ye-bun.

28
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,054
Open the door.

29
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,731
Drive.

30
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,849
Cut!

31
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,767
Okay.

32
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
Good work, everyone.

33
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,941
That was some great acting.

34
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:57,445
You two make such a great team.

35
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,488
Shut up.

36
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,199
I'm complimenting you.

37
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,661
We got you out of the station
just as you wanted.

38
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,204
So tell us where Ok-hui is.

39
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,749
Wait, that's not right.

40
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,545
You also have to take me
to where I want to go.

41
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,925
I'll tell you where she is
once we get there.

42
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,427
Okay?

43
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,796
What a way to treat your hostage.

44
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,467
Why is it so dark here?

45
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,971
Is this the right place?

46
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,640
The GPS led us to the address you gave us,
so it must be.

47
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,601
I guess the GPS can't be wrong.

48
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,020
Now tell us.

49
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,354
Where's Ok-hui?

50
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,605
Ok-hui?

51
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,274
Ok-hui's…

52
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,486
But I think Detective Moon will arrest me
if I tell you right now.

53
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,200
And I'm not sure
I can beat him in a fight.

54
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,953
My safety comes first.

55
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,249
-Don't you think?
-Are you serious, you asshole?

56
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,045
Keep this up, and Ok-hui dies.

57
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,340
There's not much time.

58
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,635
What do you want us to do?

59
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,513
There's not much you can do.

60
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,060
It's not like I can ask you guys
to guarantee my safety.

61
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,313
I should put my own safeguards in place.

62
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,315
Don't you agree?

63
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,485
Detective Moon?

64
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,701
Detective, are you okay? Detective!

65
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,411
Who are you?

66
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,121
Let go of me!

67
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,250
Detective!

68
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,585
Let go!

69
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,971
This is unbelievable.

70
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,934
Great to see you again!

71
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,560
You bastard!

72
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,603
There you go.

73
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,688
That kind of glare

74
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,525
is more like you.

75
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,445
No, don't! Detective!

76
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,868
Not so fast.

77
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,205
Are you already out of it? Is that it?

78
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,415
That's no fun.

79
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,918
Come on, we're far from finished.

80
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,130
I haven't paid you back
for all the crap you put me through.

81
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,173
Take a couple more hits, will you?

82
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,677
Lift his head.

83
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,137
Look at me, Detective Moon.

84
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,513
Look at me.

85
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,283
Detective.

86
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,369
Detective, are you okay?

87
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,163
Wake up.

88
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
Stop shaking me.

89
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,292
You're making me dizzy.

90
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,753
You really scared me.

91
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,713
Are you okay?

92
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,673
What about you?

93
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,926
Did they hurt you?

94
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:08,654
I never thought you'd actually
bring Detective Moon to me.

95
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,783
Who told you about him and me?

96
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,453
Nobody told me.

97
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,871
I saw it myself.

98
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,040
I have something to discuss with Dr. Bong.

99
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,334
Could you give us a moment?

100
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,301
Am I speaking to Mr. Baek Sun-gil?

101
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,728
Head over there,

102
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,480
and you'll find a boat headed for China.

103
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,691
19 SAMON-RI, GANGSU-MYEON

104
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,276
Thank you.

105
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,819
No need to thank me.

106
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,989
I'll be getting paid for this.

107
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,450
Paid?

108
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,826
That'll be 30 million won.

109
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,662
That's how much it costs

110
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,248
to stow away someone like you to China.

111
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,250
I said I'd get you a way out,

112
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,335
but I never said it was for free.

113
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,462
But I brought

114
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,506
Detective Moon to you.

115
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,550
Come now.

116
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,969
I think you're misunderstanding
something here.

117
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,888
Getting my hands on someone like him

118
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,058
is a piece of cake for me.

119
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,102
I just chose not to.

120
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,603
Why?

121
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,147
Because I wasn't getting paid for it.

122
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:26,899
Look.

123
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,319
Revenge doesn't get you money.

124
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,536
I can see everything.

125
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,540
You're obsessed with money.

126
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,878
You get girls addicted to drugs
and make them work at shady bars.

127
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,549
And you take away the money they earn
by selling drugs back to them.

128
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,218
But don't you think you crossed the line

129
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,555
when you got friends and family
into drugs for money?

130
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,516
After your Moon Jang-yeol
ruined your business,

131
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,729
you barely managed to buy a few boats
and make deals here and there.

132
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,815
But he messed it all up again.

133
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,860
You had metal pins
inserted into your chin.

134
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,237
You couldn't eat for a while,

135
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:18,534
and you had to drool like a dog.

136
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,954
Who the hell are you?

137
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,291
Who told you all those things?

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,627
I already told you.

139
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,128
Nobody told me.

140
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,921
I saw it myself.

141
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,717
It's true that revenge
doesn't get you money.

142
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,344
But…

143
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,804
there's something else that does.

144
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,933
How do you think Moon Jang-yeol,
who was exiled to Mujin,

145
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,687
suddenly knew that you bought
fishing boats for your drug deals?

146
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,109
I have the power to see anyone's past

147
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,320
just by looking into their eyes.

148
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,783
And that girl with Moon Jang-yeol
also has that power.

149
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,871
But she has to touch the butt.

150
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,666
Goodness, what is this about?

151
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,669
I'll take a look and see
if he really did kill him.

152
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,183
I heard your new partner
is quite fascinating, Detective Moon.

153
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,687
But I wonder
if I should actually believe this.

154
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,856
You.

155
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,110
Can you really see everything
by touching butts?

156
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,987
Is that why you touched my butt that time?

157
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,286
I guess he wouldn't have taken you
to dangerous places just for fun.

158
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,832
Then was he telling the truth?

159
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
I think he was scamming you.

160
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,753
All we have to do is test it out.

161
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,964
If not,

162
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,967
we can use her like the other girls.

163
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,053
We'll get 30 million won
out of her in no time.

164
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,641
Do your thing and make her compliant.

165
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,851
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
What do I do with him?

167
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
Hand him over to Dr. Jin.

168
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,357
He'll know what to do.

169
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,073
Detective, what do we do?

170
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,616
Your hand…

171
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,201
What?

172
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,840
The National Police…

173
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,093
What did you say?

174
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,053
The National Police University.

175
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,149
What are you doing?

176
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,400
Where are you taking him?

177
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,361
No, you can't do this!

178
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,741
Detective!

179
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,812
Hey.

180
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,147
Let's make this easy, okay?

181
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,400
I've given this shot
to over a hundred women.

182
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,153
I'm an expert, so you won't feel a thing.

183
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,197
So don't you worry.

184
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,426
You little bitch.

185
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:07,429
The National Police University.

186
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,476
During abductions or hostage situations,

187
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,604
cable ties are the easiest way
to tie someone up.

188
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,022
To break free from them,

189
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,192
swing your arms backward
and hit your stomach as hard as you can.

190
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,695
Let's try it, starting with number one.

191
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,081
I'm the expert
when it comes to injections.

192
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,061
They dragged him away in that direction.

193
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,818
Three bad guys
are by the fire to the right.

194
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,670
And there's someone on watch over here.

195
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,475
He often got told off
because he'd be distracted by his phone.

196
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,135
Who are you?

197
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,721
How did you get in here?

198
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,019
Next to the door,

199
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,437
there's an iron pipe.

200
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,706
Are you trying to kill him?

201
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you okay?

202
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,130
I feel better now that I got some rest.

203
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,257
Hurry.

204
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,517
So it wasn't a scam.

205
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,728
Hey, Miss.

206
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,605
You have the power to see everything,

207
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,816
but you missed the CCTVs?

208
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,736
Boys,

209
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,739
I don't care if you kill the detective.

210
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,284
But don't you lay a finger on the girl.

211
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,664
There are so damn many of you.

212
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,835
Stick close to me and don't get hurt.

213
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,136
I give up.

214
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,387
I surrender.

215
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,305
What did you say?

216
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,183
I can't hear very well right now.

217
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,435
I surrender, sir.

218
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,562
What is he saying?

219
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
I don't understand him either.

220
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,527
This bastard still won't surrender?

221
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,633
Ok-hui must still be in Mujin somewhere.

222
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,929
-Ok-hui!
-Sis!

223
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,764
Bae Ok-hui!

224
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,599
-Ok-hui!
-Wait.

225
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,185
You crazy bastard!
Where the hell are you right now?

226
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,314
The Major Crimes Division
is pissed as hell looking for you.

227
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,775
They think you joined hands
with Park Jong-bae!

228
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,569
There's no time to explain right now.

229
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,612
We have a rough idea
of where Ok-hui may be.

230
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,738
What?

231
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,615
You know where Ok-hui is?

232
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,909
Listen carefully.

233
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,329
The shaman took Ok-hui
out of the downtown area by car.

234
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,665
He went in the direction of Jungsan.

235
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,001
And he turned right
at the three-way intersection.

236
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,085
Hold on.

237
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,796
Jungsan is in the opposite direction.

238
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,381
We came to the wrong place.

239
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,134
Got it. I'll call you back
once we get there.

240
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,094
We were completely wrong.

241
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,305
She's not here. Let's go.

242
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,694
Where are Detective Moon and Ms. Bong?

243
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,614
You know where they are, don't you?

244
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,617
The thing is…

245
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,452
This counts as harboring a fugitive.

246
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,787
My sister has been abducted.

247
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,040
We have to go save her right now!

248
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,125
-Bring them all in.
-Wait.

249
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,668
I mean…

250
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,795
Everyone run.

251
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,444
Yong-myeong!

252
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
-Get on!
-Come here!

253
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,035
Thank you!

254
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,203
Everyone, get on!

255
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,289
Dr. Bong.

256
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,416
We're at the location you told us about.

257
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,209
Where do we go from here?

258
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,086
Right.

259
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,630
You can roughly understand
what's going on, right?

260
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
This is the end of my little hint.

261
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,135
You can't see, can you?

262
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,636
Of course, you can't.

263
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,013
I closed my eyes.

264
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,311
He closed his eyes from that point on.

265
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,520
I can't see anything.

266
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,648
Do you see any place
where he could have locked her up?

267
00:21:59,109 --> 00:21:59,943
Well…

268
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,030
There's no place like that here.

269
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,007
I really can't see anything.

270
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,720
Let's all spread out

271
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,221
and look for her, okay?

272
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,598
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.

273
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,857
Dr. Bong.

274
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,734
When I'm teaching a class,

275
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,070
the students mess around
whenever I'm not looking.

276
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,655
So when I'm writing on the board,

277
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,365
I focus on the sounds.

278
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,284
And I can hear the kids

279
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,078
throwing around messages,

280
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,996
unwrapping candy,

281
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,083
and even doodling in their textbooks.

282
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,045
Try to focus, Dr. Bong.

283
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:03,507
Sometimes, you can see more with your ears
than with your eyes.

284
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,180
You can't see, can you?

285
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,307
Of course, you can't.

286
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,475
I closed my eyes.

287
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,020
You're going to have
a hard time with this one.

288
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,195
I could hear chimes.

289
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,197
Like the ones in a Buddhist temple.

290
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,824
A temple?

291
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,451
There's not even a house around here,
let alone a temple.

292
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,955
No, I definitely heard
something like chimes.

293
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,457
Then it must not be here.
I'll look somewhere else.

294
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,292
-Da-eun, let's go.
-Yeah?

295
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,313
Was it this sound?

296
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,399
Yes, that's right.

297
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,443
Then he must have taken Ok-hui
in this direction.

298
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,872
What next?

299
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,832
What did you hear next?

300
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,048
I heard the sound of footsteps.

301
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,717
Did you hear anything else?

302
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,927
I only heard footsteps.

303
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,847
We can't find her with just that.

304
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,394
The footsteps got louder.

305
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,354
All of a sudden?

306
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,357
Yes, they definitely
got louder than before.

307
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,527
That must mean
he was walking on a different surface.

308
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,905
It's not here.

309
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,536
-Da-eun.
-What?

310
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,219
He passed through here with Ok-hui.

311
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,064
What next?

312
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,690
What did you hear after that?

313
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,860
What is this?

314
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,321
Birds?

315
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,156
Wind?

316
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,159
I heard something flutter.

317
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,497
Is there something like
a flag or a banner nearby?

318
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,959
Flag, banner…

319
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,669
Flag…

320
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,171
There is!

321
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,548
There are cloths fluttering
from the village's sacred tree!

322
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,842
That's right. That's the place!

323
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,644
What next?

324
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,104
What sound did you hear next?

325
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,897
Okay, next…

326
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,446
I heard a big thump
of something falling to the ground.

327
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,573
I think he threw Ok-hui down somewhere.

328
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,158
To the ground?

329
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,869
So…

330
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,121
She fell somewhere?

331
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,248
Are you sure you got that right?

332
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:27,210
There's no place around here
for someone to fall into.

333
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,088
No, I definitely heard a loud thump.

334
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,132
But there's nothing but flat ground here.

335
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,384
I don't see any place
a person could fall into.

336
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,554
There's not even a place
where he could have hidden her!

337
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:39,931
That can't be right.

338
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,599
That's not possible.

339
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,477
She'll definitely be
somewhere around there.

340
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,522
Sis!

341
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,165
I've lost a lot of money through stocks.

342
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,626
And in the world of stocks,
there's a song that goes like this.

343
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,922
I thought I had hit rock bottom

344
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,467
But there was a cellar underneath

345
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,954
Sis!

346
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:47,957
Sis!

347
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,293
Are you okay, sis?

348
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,546
Sis!

349
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,841
Are you okay?

350
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,343
Sis!

351
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:00,970
Sis!

352
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,516
Sis!

353
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,143
Are you okay?

354
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,193
Are you insane?

355
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,278
-Sis!
-Sis!

356
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,197
Oh, no!

357
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,657
-Sis!
-Are you okay?

358
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,075
My goodness.

359
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:22,992
Open your eyes, sis!

360
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,077
Are you okay, sis?

361
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,495
I was so…

362
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,497
It hurts, sis.

363
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,498
Sis.

364
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,125
I guess you're okay, sis.

365
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,877
Thankfully, she will have
no trouble recovering.

366
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,089
She's on her way
to the university hospital right now.

367
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,384
What happened with Park Jong-bae?

368
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,302
I'll bring him in, sir.

369
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,930
How? You said he already ran away.

370
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,390
I have a plan.

371
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,276
Have you heard from the client
I told you about?

372
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,238
He was in such a rush,
so we agreed to leave tomorrow morning.

373
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,492
Call me the minute he gets on the boat.

374
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,410
Okay.

375
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,829
What time did he say he'd come?

376
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,581
I don't know.

377
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,583
I was going to stay out here from dawn.

378
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,173
So you think the shaman might read us
if you take action yourself?

379
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,383
We'll have to use our brains to catch him.

380
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,543
Are we really getting 50,000 won for this?

381
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,045
I'm telling you, yes.

382
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,882
But these aren't even worth 5,000 won.

383
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,550
Are you sure this isn't a scam?

384
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,970
Is everyone here?

385
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,350
You collected a lot.

386
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,768
Let me pay you.

387
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,313
-Thank you.
-Hold on, could you look at me?

388
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,525
-Have you had breakfast?
-Yes, I have.

389
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,326
Stop moving your head. Stay still.

390
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,166
-Can I really accept this?
-Sure, buy yourself a nice meal.

391
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,544
I should take this too.

392
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,213
Is it okay to accept this?

393
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,048
Of course.
You all remind me of my parents.

394
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,181
Well then.
I wish you all a long and healthy life.

395
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,108
We can't see well from here.
What if we miss him?

396
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,111
This is the only way.

397
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,406
He's probably reading people's memories

398
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,491
to check if we're here.

399
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,996
Then I guess we have no choice
but to wait for the boat captain's call.

400
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,994
Hide under the tarp here.

401
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,495
What?

402
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,377
Right, okay.

403
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,263
CAPTAIN PARK

404
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,224
He just got on the boat.

405
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:16,851
Let's go.

406
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,103
What about me?

407
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,123
Have you heard from the client
I told you about?

408
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,502
He was in such a rush,
so we agreed to leave tomorrow morning.

409
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,629
Call me the minute he gets on the boat.

410
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,215
He came all the way here
when there's no money in it for him?

411
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,926
He's not the kind of man to do that.

412
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,402
335,000 WON

413
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,070
14,501 WON

414
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,782
3,550,000 WON

415
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,908
616,292,230 WON

416
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,829
Gosh, I'm sorry.

417
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,664
-It's all right.
-So sorry.

418
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,348
ENTER YOUR PIN

419
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,142
Please select the amount you want to…

420
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,604
Just touch anybody.

421
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,981
-What?
-Someone must have seen him.

422
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,566
But who do I touch?

423
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,870
Police.

424
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,748
You just jaywalked.

425
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,458
I'm sorry.

426
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,209
Allow me to conduct a body search.

427
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,796
What? A body search for jaywalking?

428
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,137
He went to the bank.

429
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,263
NAEUN BANK

430
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,229
He couldn't have gone far.

431
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,158
Nam-cheol!

432
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,576
Hey.

433
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,291
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

434
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,965
Over there.

435
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,287
Hey, it's me.

436
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,414
Can I still get to China?

437
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,626
I'll give you however much you want,
so just tell me if it's possible.

438
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,628
In three hours?

439
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,840
Okay. See you then.

440
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,314
That's enough.

441
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,191
Whatever.

442
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,071
Kids, did you see a man come by this way?

443
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,781
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

444
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,495
Hey, guys.

445
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,582
I'm kind of bored.
Do you want to play a game with me?

446
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,170
Why don't we play cops and robbers?

447
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,338
What kind of game is that?

448
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,550
It's a game where the robbers hide,
and the cop catches them.

449
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,343
What? It sounds boring.

450
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:23,472
It's not boring at all
since a real cop's going to go after you.

451
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,308
This guy here is a real cop.

452
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,643
Here, look.

453
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,900
Hold on.

454
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,319
You can touch the handcuffs
once we're done playing.

455
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,322
Okay, let's start playing
cops and robbers.

456
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,948
You all are the robbers.

457
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,451
While the officer has his eyes closed,

458
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,661
you're going to go over there and hide.

459
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,372
You win if he can't find you

460
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,958
by the time you count to ten.

461
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,418
Then you can touch the handcuffs.

462
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,628
-Okay?
-Okay.

463
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,672
Now go and hide. We start now!

464
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,174
Go far and hide, okay?

465
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,608
One.

466
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,610
Two. Three.

467
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,862
-Four.
-Four.

468
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,197
-Five.
-Five.

469
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,198
-Six.
-Six.

470
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,158
-Seven.
-Seven.

471
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,076
-Eight.
-Eight.

472
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,953
-Nine.
-Nine.

473
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,371
-Ten.
-Ten.

474
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,082
-You guys win!
-Yeah, you win.

475
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,043
Officer, let them touch your handcuffs.

476
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,753
Such a good job!

477
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,671
You did so great.

478
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,631
How did you hide so well?

479
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,132
You did really well.

480
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,470
Good job.

481
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,305
-This looks like a key.
-It's so shiny.

482
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,026
I found him.

483
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,677
Detective! The window's open!

484
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,423
Are you all right?

485
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,924
Are you okay?

486
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,013
Park Jong-bae did this.

487
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,225
Excuse me for a moment.

488
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,271
Stop following me.

489
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,107
If you keep coming,
I'll kill the next person for real.

490
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,697
He went that way.

491
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,074
But…

492
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,951
He said if we kept following him,

493
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,828
he'd kill someone.

494
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,872
That crazy bastard!

495
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,208
But we can't just let him go.

496
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,961
This bastard will never stop killing.

497
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,440
-Sir, are you okay?
-Stay here.

498
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,817
-I'll get a paramedic.
-Okay.

499
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,820
Sir, are you okay?

500
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,279
Sir, are you…

501
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,073
Excuse me.

502
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,866
Sir, are you okay?

503
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,093
I told you
I'd kill the next person for real.

504
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,221
And I guess

505
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,557
that's you.

506
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:43,899
What the…

507
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,027
Where's the injured person?

508
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,749
Bong Ye-bun!

509
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,169
Detective.

510
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,467
Are you all right?

511
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,551
Detective.

512
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,597
Such shitty timing!

513
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,976
Do you really want to see Dr. Bong die?

514
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,773
What's going on here?

515
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,779
It seems that you'll be
the saddest person to see her die.

516
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,784
So let me keep her with me
until I get to safety.

517
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,497
Once I get to China,
I'll send her right back.

518
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:41,874
So back off.

519
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,460
Or I'll just kill her right here!

520
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,131
-Detective.
-It's okay, Bong.

521
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,049
I'll save you.

522
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,677
Have you lost your mind?
How will you save her in this situation?

523
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,513
I'll show you how.

524
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,432
Bong Ye-bun,

525
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,475
watch me closely.

526
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,186
You know what my superpower is.

527
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,106
Yes, that one.

528
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm going to use it now.

529
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,862
You're bluffing.

530
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,657
Keep that up, and she dies.

531
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,200
What is it?

532
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,453
You think you're the only one
with a superpower?

533
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:20,913
I have one too.

534
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,087
Once I count to three,

535
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,922
all of this will be over.

536
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
I'm going to count to three.

537
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,179
Okay, one.

538
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,572
This is my superpower, you bastard.

539
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,493
You'll rot in prison
for the rest of your life.

540
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,163
So what if I go to prison?

541
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,833
I may not be a free man,

542
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,501
but I bet I can still do whatever I want.

543
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,380
And if I want to kill,

544
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,132
I'll just kill in there.

545
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,426
With my eyes…

546
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,347
I could get chummy with anyone,
be it the guards or the inmates.

547
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,392
I think I'll have it quite easy in there.

548
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,104
Don't you agree, Detective Moon?

549
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,070
I'm going to visit you every week!

550
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,615
But you won't be able to see me.
You know why?

551
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,076
Because I'll poke you in the eyes
every time I'm there!

552
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,665
Hey, stop.

553
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,876
Bong Ye-bun, stop.

554
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,252
Hey, that's enough.

555
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,254
Stop eating him.

556
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,715
Stop it.

557
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,217
I said, stop it.

558
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:19,448
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

559
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,495
Have some tangerines.

560
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,122
-Oh, my. What's this sweet fragrance?
-Goodness!

561
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,423
Goodness, you have a huge appetite.

562
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,260
Hey.

563
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,596
What are you doing next month on the 25th?

564
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,392
Nothing much.

565
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,854
Then don't make any plans that day.

566
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,856
Why?

567
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,568
-Are we going somewhere?
-Yeah, to a wedding.

568
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,657
Is someone getting married?

569
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,908
Yeah.

570
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:03,826
We are.

571
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,036
We are?

572
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,081
What?

573
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,749
We are?

574
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,961
Oh, Jong-muk.

575
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:19,675
Who suddenly decides
to get married in a month?

576
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,220
We shouldn't rush this.

577
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,348
We're not rushing anything.

578
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,350
And it's not sudden either.

579
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,145
For me…

580
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,731
I've waited for this wedding for 30 years.

581
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,318
Jong-muk.

582
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,030
Dr. Bong!

583
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,118
Detective Na, what are you doing here?

584
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,328
-Hello.
-Is Dr. Bong in?

585
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,289
-She's…
-I'm here for a neutering procedure.

586
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,166
Do you have a dog?

587
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,460
No, I don't have a dog.
But it's something similar.

588
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,086
Get in here, damn it!

589
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,172
Hurry up and get in here.

590
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,007
My goodness.

591
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,759
It's mating season for him
every single day of the year.

592
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,052
Can we get a consultation?

593
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,556
No, we don't treat human patients here.

594
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,474
He's not human.

595
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,810
He's worse than an animal. I should just…

596
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,062
Dr. Bong is here, right? Dr. Bong!

597
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,732
-Wait, you should go see a urologist.
-Dr. Bong!

598
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,401
-Hey, that's where we live!
-Dr. Bong!

599
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,491
SEOUL, GYEONGGI
SEOUL TERMINAL

600
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,994
You said you'd get back to
the Regional Investigation Unit in Seoul.

601
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,787
-You kept your word.
-Yeah.

602
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,124
You didn't have to see me off
like this, sir.

603
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,502
Great work, Detective Bae.

604
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,421
Captain.

605
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,716
Thank you for everything.

606
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,928
They have great udon noodles
at the station here, you know.

607
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,554
He says it's a shame

608
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,848
and wants to have noodles with you
before you go.

609
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,185
I've been here long enough
to understand these things now.

610
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,021
Thanks for being my interpreter
this whole time.

611
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,773
Just wait for me.

612
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,318
I'm also going to get assigned
to the Regional Investigation…

613
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,865
The bus really might leave without you.
Hurry up and go.

614
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,117
I understand you, sir.

615
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,827
I'm sad too.

616
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,204
I'll keep in touch with you.

617
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,415
I said the bus is leaving.

618
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,334
Yes.

619
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,586
I also don't want to say goodbye.

620
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,381
Look behind you, man.
The bus is actually leaving.

621
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,676
Stop!

622
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,937
Hurry up and get going.

623
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,221
Bong.

624
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,895
What happened?

625
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,690
You didn't go to Seoul?

626
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,068
I'm going to take the next bus.

627
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,573
I mean,

628
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,950
the bus after that works too.

629
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,413
I saw that there are late-night buses too.

630
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,165
A lot of them.

631
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,966
NO LATE-NIGHT BUSES

632
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,771
Congratulations

633
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,899
on going back to Seoul

634
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,150
just as you planned.

635
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:06,902
Thanks.

636
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,783
What are you planning to do from now on?

637
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:16,662
I guess…

638
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,373
I'll work hard running the hospital

639
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,917
and earn lots of money.

640
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,505
It'd be nice if I could open up
a second location too.

641
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,216
What about me?

642
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,553
What about me?

643
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,517
Once you've worked hard
running the hospital,

644
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,477
earned lots of money,

645
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,605
and opened up a second location,

646
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,524
maybe you could…

647
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,613
make plans to come see me.

648
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:19,599
8 MONTHS LATER

649
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,643
Let's start the shoot.

650
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:22,686
Action.

651
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:23,937
Hello, dear viewers.

652
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm Jang Do-youn
of Dogs Are Really Incredible.

653
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,402
We have a special expert
on our show today.

654
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,528
Our guest today

655
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,739
can not only communicate
with all kinds of dogs in the world

656
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:38,368
but also communicate with
16,000 different kinds of animals.

657
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:41,913
Gosh, the lengths they go to
to get high ratings.

658
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,541
-This show's gone to the dogs.
-Excuse me?

659
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,920
Let me introduce Dr. Bong Ye-bun,
our guest animal psychoanalyst.

660
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,046
Hello.

661
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,257
Hello, everyone.

662
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:57,137
I'm Bong Ye-bun, an animal communicator.

663
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,264
Dr. Bong,

664
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,391
so you can communicate with animals?

665
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,309
That's right.

666
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,936
How exactly?

667
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,233
What sound is this?

668
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,611
A dog barking?

669
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,529
Actually, it's a bunch of nonsense.

670
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,157
So do you communicate through sound?

671
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,327
No, it's not through sound.

672
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246
I communicate with animals
by touching them.

673
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,001
So you can read an animal's mind
by touching them?

674
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,169
Yes, that's right.

675
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:34,341
This is kind of hard to believe
without witnessing it in person.

676
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:39,054
Then shall we bring out
our pet owner for today?

677
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,181
-Hello.
-Hello.

678
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,766
Hello. Oh, my.

679
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,396
Okay, may I ask
what brought you to the show today?

680
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,483
I recently adopted this guy.

681
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,776
His name is Bori.

682
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,238
But for some reason,
he seems fixated on my shoes.

683
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,198
He keeps running off with them

684
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,409
and growls when I try to take them back.

685
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,496
I'm worried because it seems to be
getting worse.

686
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:10,126
There are various reasons
why dogs may become fixated on shoes.

687
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,048
They may be suffering from gum disease,
or their teeth may be itching.

688
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,926
It could also be from stress.

689
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,138
Let me talk with Bori
to find out the details.

690
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,431
-Sure.
-Yes.

691
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,517
Hey, Bori.

692
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,685
There's a good dog.

693
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,728
-You're going to touch the dog?
-Yes.

694
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:31,898
You're so sweet.

695
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,068
I think they're communicating right now.

696
00:52:45,161 --> 00:52:46,121
I'll be back.

697
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,625
Why are you in the corner?

698
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,756
Come home with me.

699
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,384
Bori, I'll be back.

700
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,601
Bori, come here! Give that back!

701
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:50,810
Bori, give that back.

702
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,730
Come on. Give it back.

703
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,732
-What does Bori say?
-I have to go.

704
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,655
I think he's quite afraid of you

705
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,407
putting on your shoes
and leaving the house.

706
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,992
What do you mean?

707
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,079
It seems that Bori's previous owner

708
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,540
passed away in an accident
while he was out.

709
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:16,127
That's why when you put on your shoes,

710
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,715
Bori is scared that you won't come back
like his previous owner.

711
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,969
That's why he tries to stop you
from putting on your shoes.

712
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,347
He thinks he'll lose
another person that he loves.

713
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,184
I did hear that his previous owner
passed away in an accident.

714
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,228
Oh, my.

715
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,854
What in the world?

716
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,398
Then what should I do?

717
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,943
Gain Bori's trust on this issue.

718
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:44,197
Make him believe
that you'll come back home no matter what.

719
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,661
Dr. Bong, you're amazing.

720
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,999
-Excuse me, Dr. Bong.
-Yes?

721
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,542
I just find this so fascinating.

722
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,752
Can you touch me
and tell me what I'm thinking?

723
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,337
Right here?

724
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,463
Yes, where else?

725
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,924
Do-youn, we need to move on
to the next owner.

726
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,134
Okay.

727
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,301
What's the rush?

728
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,846
Tomorrow's schedule is Believe That or Not

729
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,389
and Animal Barn.

730
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,267
Can I get some rest?

731
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,144
I haven't taken a break at all lately.

732
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,937
Bong Ye-bun.

733
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,439
Don't you want to be a star?

734
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,898
Don't you want to make money?

735
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,942
Don't you want to buy designer bags?

736
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,027
I do!

737
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,486
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

738
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,618
Bong, cover your ears.

739
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:33,830
Hello?

740
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,416
It's your Ok-hui speaking.

741
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,961
I'm calling you
right on time as ordered, sis.

742
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,964
I told you not to answer the phone
in such a matter-of-fact way.

743
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,257
Sis.

744
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,677
My friends seem to be
distancing themselves from me lately.

745
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,305
And yesterday,
I ran into my mother on the street,

746
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,474
and she pretended not to know me.

747
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,725
So?

748
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,311
Are you saying other people
are more important to you than me?

749
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,063
You'll always be my number one, sis!

750
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,315
Right?

751
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,983
Then here's take two.

752
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:08,948
Your dear Oki has missed you
so, so, so much all day.

753
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,619
Yongmaeng is sad. He's so very sad.

754
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,288
He misses Oki so much,
but he can't see her.

755
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,247
So Yongmaeng is sad.

756
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,250
Oh, no.

757
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,170
Look at pictures of Oki on your phone

758
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,422
and try really hard

759
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,007
not to cry.

760
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,051
I don't wanna.

761
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,720
Yongmaeng wants to see Oki right now.

762
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,098
Yongmaeng is going to
go to sleep right now

763
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,266
so he can at least see Oki in his dreams.

764
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,770
Then make sure to dream of Oki.

765
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,022
You promise?

766
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,440
I promise.

767
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,944
Do things right before I tell you to.

768
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,445
Understood, sis.

769
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,572
Have a good night, sis.

770
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,201
You guys are so childish.

771
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,661
Do you like doing that?

772
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,414
Dating is all about being childish, okay?

773
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,502
Lose that, and you lose your spark
and go into a rut.

774
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,797
You shouldn't date if you don't want to be
childish and silly.

775
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,014
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

776
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,892
Ok-hui. Stop the car.

777
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,144
What's wrong? What is it?

778
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,353
Just stop the car!

779
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,608
Who are you going to meet?

780
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,281
Do you have any lipstick?

781
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,201
How is it working
in the Regional Investigation Unit?

782
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,744
It's manageable.

783
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,249
Have you looked into that thing yet?

784
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,918
About that…

785
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,303
What is that?

786
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,847
Is it salted pollack roe?

787
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,394
Detective Moon.

788
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,855
Bong Ye-bun?

789
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,443
I'm having some serious déjà vu.

790
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,404
You two should talk.

791
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,159
What are you doing here?

792
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,247
You told me I should let you know
if I came to Seoul.

793
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,083
You wanted to grab a meal together.

794
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,017
So…

795
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,397
I've come up with a plan.

796
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,982
-Actually--
-One second.

797
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:50,902
Hey.

798
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,363
You couldn't find it?

799
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,073
Okay.

800
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,700
What were you saying?

801
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,747
So my plan is…

802
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,333
Hello?

803
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,460
I'm tracking them right now.

804
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,587
I'll find out no matter what.

805
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,842
Sorry. What were you saying?

806
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,053
Well, I…

807
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,223
What the heck?

808
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,558
Why are you so busy?

809
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,436
Sorry, I have a case
that's a bit of a headache.

810
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,982
Then will you have
more time to spare if I help you?

811
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,321
No.

812
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,407
I'm not going to ask
for your help anymore.

813
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,201
Why? I'd love to help.

814
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,705
If we keep that up,
I'll only come to you when I need help.

815
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,873
It'll feel like I'm using you.

816
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,960
And I don't want to
put you in danger anymore.

817
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,170
Who cares if you use me?
Aren't we more than that?

818
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:55,466
What?

819
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,135
Never mind.

820
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,470
I'd really love to help you,

821
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,973
and that's why I'm offering.

822
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,768
Then again,

823
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,147
everything would be solved
if you just touched one butt.

824
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,773
That's simple then.

825
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,567
What should I do first?

826
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:14,902
First,

827
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,406
I think you'll need to change your outfit.

828
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,409
-My outfit?
-Yeah.

829
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,619
Into a uniform.

830
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,955
It's always been a dream of mine

831
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,292
to work for a company
while wearing their uniform.

832
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,171
You call this a uniform?

833
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,965
These are prison clothes!

834
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,508
That's another name for them.

835
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,678
Seriously? You tricked me again!

836
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,096
Get me out of here right now.

837
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,807
What do you mean, trick you?
We're working for our country.

838
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,562
There's a woman named Lee Jung-eun

839
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,898
who used to be a drug lord
outside the country.

840
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:55,943
The issue is that she's trafficking drugs
domestically too.

841
01:00:56,569 --> 01:01:01,824
She's the only one who knows
the domestic person in charge.

842
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,276
I'll break every bone in your body

843
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,153
if you touch me.

844
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,158
What do you want?

845
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,913
It's nice to meet you

846
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,791
My name is Bong

847
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,959
Ye-bun

848
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,001
Bong Ye-bun

849
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,421
Let's start

850
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,506
Another happy day

851
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,841
Behind bars

852
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,634
Let's go!

853
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,010
Choo-choo!

854
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,806
Stop being a nuisance
and get out of my sight.

855
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,224
Sounds good

856
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,476
I'll shove myself out of your sight
From head to toe

857
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,645
Thank you

858
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,701
Hey, newbie.

859
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,286
Yes, sis.

860
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,371
What did you do for a living?

861
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,375
You might not believe me,

862
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,668
but I was a veterinarian.

863
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,794
A vet?

864
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,005
Hey.

865
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,340
You should've told me sooner.

866
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,551
I needed someone like you.

867
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,560
If you let

868
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:55,062
even a single mosquito bite me,

869
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,316
I'm going to bite you.

870
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,568
Understood.

871
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:06,574
But what do mosquitoes have to do
with a veterinarian?

872
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,202
Mosquitos are animals.

873
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,510
I got them.

874
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,239
I just have to touch her butt once.

875
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,563
SEOUN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

876
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,580
Why the hell are they being so loud?

877
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:38,916
It's because we're starting
our soccer tournament today.

878
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,501
-Soccer?
-Yes.

879
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,172
We get a night of leave if we win, right?

880
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,887
We have to win this time, no matter what.

881
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:56,726
-Victory!
-Victory!

882
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:57,643
Oh, wait!

883
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,562
We have a problem.

884
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,025
Our usual goalkeeper
was released a couple of days ago.

885
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,026
Jeez.

886
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,987
Damn it, that's not good.

887
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,739
Is there anyone who can replace her?

888
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,490
Sis.

889
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,659
I'll be our goalkeeper.

890
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:15,328
You?

891
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,373
Have any mosquitoes bitten you
since I got here?

892
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,168
No, they haven't.

893
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,588
There's no one better at
catching things than me.

894
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,890
TEAM JUNG-EUN 1, TEAM MI-RA 0

895
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,061
Don't crowd around together!
Hey, you! Get back!

896
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:41,354
Mark her!

897
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,688
-Get to the front!
-Yes!

898
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,191
Get on her! We win if we block this one!

899
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,363
Hey, newbie!

900
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,198
Keep your eyes on the ball!

901
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:53,616
Okay, sis!

902
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:18,557
What the hell?

903
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,642
What did she do?

904
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:33,155
I was just…

905
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:37,994
You're going to die today.

906
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,161
Sorry?

907
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,225
What are you doing here?

908
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:03,811
I felt bad about sending you here
all alone for my case.

909
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,438
Plus,

910
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,565
I didn't want to see you get hurt.

911
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,276
Hold on.

912
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,820
So you've been watching over me
this whole time?

913
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:14,989
Well…

914
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,744
Did you see who's in charge
of the drug trafficking?

915
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,537
The gang is in Busan right now.

916
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:24,665
Let's go.

917
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,583
Go where?

918
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:26,917
What do you mean, where?

919
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,544
Now that we're done here,

920
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,921
we should go to a restaurant
and then watch a movie or something.

921
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:35,634
Are you asking me out on a date right now?

922
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,720
How romantic.

923
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
But it's too bad.

924
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,933
I don't think I can just let you go.

925
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,061
-Girls!
-Yes, sis.

926
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,771
What do we do?

927
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,647
Get them!

928
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,483
-Just run!
-What?

929
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,400
That little…

930
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,032
Wait, stop!

931
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:43,661
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

932
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,664
ARFIE (MON CHER)
MEOWIE (GILLIAN)

933
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,483
One more time.

934
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:16,861
Action.

935
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,778
THE STAFF'S COUGHING SOUND

936
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,572
LOL

937
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,283
I can see their whole life in…

938
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,200
WHAT?

939
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,161
Age, Bong Ye-bun.

940
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,288
What was it again?

941
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,873
Your age isn't Bong Ye-bun.

942
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,292
GET READY AND SHOOT

943
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:32,543
Why aren't we… Hey, what?

944
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,629
"After you leave."

945
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,715
LOL

946
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:38,632
What?

947
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,760
HOLDING BACK

948
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,512
FAIL

949
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,431
I'm sorry.

950
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,725
I'm so sorry.

951
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,852
-Don't make those faces!
-What?

952
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,899
You crazy?

953
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,279
One, two, three.

954
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,075
-Great job, everyone.
-Great work!

955
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,078
