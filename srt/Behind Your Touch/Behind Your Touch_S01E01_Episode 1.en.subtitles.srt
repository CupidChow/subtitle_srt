00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:07,525
BONG YE-BUN

3
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,965
It's Ye-bun!

4
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,342
She's the daughter.

5
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,310
Mom.

6
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,023
Ye-bun.

7
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,485
Mr. Cha, what happened to my mom?

8
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,199
The rescuers smashed the car window
and pulled her out,

9
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,702
but they were too late.

10
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,871
Mom, wake up.

11
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,416
It's cold here!

12
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,671
Wake up, Mom!

13
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:10,755
Ye-bun.

14
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,882
Mom!

15
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,303
Mom!

16
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,390
Wake up, Mom!

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,393
Mom!

JUNG'S LIVESTOCK HOSPITAL

19
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,291
Ye-bun!

20
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,548
I told you to call when you got here.

21
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,383
Auntie.

22
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,429
It must have been hard.

23
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,223
Let's go inside.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
Where's Grandpa?

25
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,019
He's inside.

26
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,734
Father.

27
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,153
Ye-bun is here.

28
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,367
How have you been, Grandpa?

29
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,837
Auntie.

30
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,131
You look great.

31
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,845
Father, can you drop Ye-bun off
at her school on your way to Mr. Kim's…

32
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,472
It's her first day of school.

33
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,640
It's fine.

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,766
I'll get going.

35
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,309
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

36
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,729
Also, the daughter of your mom's friend
goes to your school and is in your year.

37
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,897
She'll help you out.

38
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,483
The daughter of Mom's friend?
What's her name?

39
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,400
BAE OK-HUI

40
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,986
Hi, I'm Ok-hui.

41
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm going to move to France in the future.

42
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,281
You're Bong Ye-bun, right?

43
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,033
Our moms were besties.
I'm sure you heard about me.

44
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:02,951
What?

45
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,661
Yes.

46
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,579
Don't be scared. I'm nice.

47
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,208
Everyone knows
that you're Dr. Jung's granddaughter,

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,251
so behave yourself.

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,835
Okay.

50
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,213
The snack bar's that way.
The salad sandwich is the best.

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,340
The roof of the east building
is occupied by bullies,

52
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,092
so don't go wandering over there.

53
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,051
Okay.

54
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,095
Also, be careful of that woman.

55
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,055
Why?

56
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,265
She and I don't get along.

57
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,186
And if someone messes with you in class,
just mention my name.

58
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,230
Then they'll at least treat you decently.

59
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,192
Get your game face on!
Or they'll chew you up like hyenas.

60
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,610
Okay.

61
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,611
Do you get good grades?

62
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,280
Well…

63
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,616
So you do.

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,617
Shoot.

65
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,203
Then it might be difficult for us
to get really close.

66
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:49,872
You're nice though, right?

67
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,750
Then it's fine.

68
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,960
Ye-bun,

69
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,671
let's do this.

70
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,465
It's nice to meet you, Ok-hui.

71
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
It was you biatches, wasn't it?

72
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,897
The hell are you looking at?

73
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,566
Do this again, and you're dead meat!

74
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,525
You got that?

75
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,321
Why should I quiet down?

76
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,322
Let go.

77
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,531
Hey!

78
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,699
Are you Hong Myeong-ho?

79
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,159
What do you think about her?

80
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,288
Ok-hui!

81
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,790
He said I'm lame!

82
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,972
Watch yourself.
I won't hit the brakes next time.

83
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,397
I'm already screwed.
Study hard without me.

00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,866
Father,

88
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,868
Ye-bun got into veterinary school.

89
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,537
She must take after your intelligence.

90
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,334
We have to head over to Mr. Ji's barn,
so get ready.

91
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,842
Your grandpa might not show it,

92
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,845
but I'm sure he's thrilled
about you getting into veterinary school.

93
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,640
Jeez, that stubborn old man.

94
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,391
At least see her off from your window!

95
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,268
Auntie,

96
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,938
I'll come back as the best veterinarian.

97
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,981
I'm going to expand our business

98
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,441
and treat you to nice things.

99
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,781
I'll get going now.

100
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,242
Hurry up. We'll miss the bus.

101
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,453
Take care of her for me, Ok-hui.

102
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,788
We're off, Auntie.

103
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,164
Take care.

111
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,660
Dr. Bong.

112
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,706
I said that I'm not going there, Ms. Jung.

113
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,374
I told you, Dr. Bong.

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,168
The patient is in critical condition.

115
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,337
You're aware that we specialize
in dogs and cats, right?

116
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,547
Yes, I'm aware.

117
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,966
And that I specialize in pets?

118
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,177
Of course. I'm aware of that too.

119
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,888
So how could you get me
a cow as a patient?

120
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,265
Don't you know
that cows are livestock, not pets?

121
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,101
But Dr. Jung used to treat cows.

122
00:07:57,185 --> 00:08:00,021
I told you, animal hospitals
need to specialize in one area.

123
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,732
Who would bring their pets
to a vet who treats livestock as well?

124
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:07,069
Things have been slow for the past decade,
even when we didn't treat livestock.

125
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
It'll all fall into place
at the right time.

126
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,657

128
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,787
I told you to take that down.

129
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,290
-People think we're a barbecue place.
-Oh, shut it.

130
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,291
Hurry up. You're late.

131
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,462
-Come on, hurry up.
-Seriously.

132
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,130
Hold on.

133
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,798
What's with all these people?

134
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,967
Did they dig up a new hot spring
or something?

135
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,262
There will be a meteor shower tonight
for the first time in 100 years.

136
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,682
And apparently,
Mount Mujin is the perfect place to watch.

137
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,017
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

138
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,810
This is our golden opportunity.

00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,895

Put them up and hand them out on your way.

143
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,069
What is this? It's so tacky.

144
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,695
It looks just fine to me!

145
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,490

00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,117

-Yes. Hello.
-Hello.

150
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,515
My dog is refusing to eat.
What's wrong with him?

151
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,350
Is that so?

152
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,520
He might have eaten
something off the floor.

153
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,439
Or you could have given him
too many treats.

154
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,818
I don't give him treats.

155
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,863
If you're worried,
bring him to the hospital sometime.

156
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,366
Oh, no need for that.

Hello, Mr. Cha.

164
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,564
Hey, Ye-bun.

165
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,733
Dr. Jung, Ye-bun's here.

166
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,570
Man, I'm beat.

167
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,157
Still, a lot of people promised
to vote for me for Dr. Jung's sake.

168

I hope it'll be an easy win this time.

169
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,496
You won last time.
I'm sure it'll be easier this time.

-Okay. Take care.

181
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,153
This town's really gone to the dogs.

182
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,407
It's actually gone to the cows and pigs.

183
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,372
What is with this place?

184
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,581
Excuse me!

185
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,336
Bong Ye-bun speaking.

186
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,588
Yes, I'm on my way right now.

187
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,474
Nice to meet you. My name is…

188
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,020
-Come on out. It's a case.
-What kind?

189
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,857
A violent crime, what else?
We're the Violent Crimes Unit.

190
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,570
Detective Na, get the combat police
and come up from behind.

191
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,572
Deok-hee and… What's your name?

192
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,739
Moon Jang-yeol, sir.

193
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,949
Moon? Like in the sky?

194
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,035
Yes, but I don't want to
leave Earth just yet.

195
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,328
What's the situation?

196
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,914
Three have been evacuated,
but more are getting injured.

197
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,500
-Let's hurry up.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,343
This way. Hurry.

199
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,848
Come on, be quick. Run!

200
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,975
-What about equipment?
-Oh, over here.

201
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,353
All right, that's the only escape route,
Detective Na.

202
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,148
Create a line to block it.
Use the Crane Wing Formation.

203
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,275
Hey, look over here.
The Crane Wing Formation.

204
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,818
Is this case drug-related?

205
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,362
Yes. Technically, it is.

206
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,363
-Sure.
-Any hostages?

207
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,823
Hostages?

208
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
Is anyone being held?

209
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,119
Well, yes. There's one.

210
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,708
Hey, what are you doing? Hurry up.

211
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,508
Oh, my god!

212
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,551
Ready yourself. Here it comes.

213
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,017
What the hell?

214
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,018
Stop it!

215
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,855
Oh, my god! Help me!

216
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:54,583
Help me!

217
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,171
Catch it!

218
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,386
Hey, is everyone all right?

219
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,179
-You.
-Yes?

220
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,389
You said it's drug-related.

221
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,474
The cow got startled while getting a shot.

222
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,892
You call this a violent crime?

223
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,812
Hey, what's more violent
than a cow running wild?

224
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,773
My hands are shaking
from our first case in forever.

225
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,651
Then who was that woman on the cow?

226
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,027
She's the vet.

227
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,488
Hey, Detective Na. How did it go?

228
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,990
We just stopped it.

229
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,785
What was that scream?

230
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,412
The cow kicked the vet.

231
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,164
My goodness. What a shame.

232
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,792
She was right about this town
going to the cows and pigs.

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,006
What the…

234
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,260
I guess you're shit out of luck.

235
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,017
What kind of town is this?

236
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,101
Oh, this town?

237
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,937
Well, we're Mujin,
the pride of Chungcheong-do.

238
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,399
We have good water, land, and generosity.
But most of all, the best people.

239
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,402
The people are simple and honest,
so we don't have any crimes.

240
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:07,239
-I really am shit out of luck.
-What?

241
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,117
Are there any development plans here?

242
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,497
Rumors of them have been going around
for about ten years now.

243
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,875
But why? Did you buy land here?

244
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,085
The town needs to be developed
for people to gather.

245
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
And that'll give us more cases to work on.

246
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,964
Goodness.

247
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,008
Your experience
in the Regional Investigation Unit

248
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,802
must have given you
a unique approach to things.

249
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,556
But how did you end up here?

250
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,559
I don't plan on staying here for long,

251
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,145
so let's not start exchanging
each other's histories.

252
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,063
Sorry?

253
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,565
I'm going back to Seoul in a month.

254
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,068
-Going back?
-I'll be reinstated to my position.

255
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,194
But how?

256
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,278
What do you mean how?

257
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,530
I'll stack up some points
by solving cases.

258
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,992
Goodness.
You should refresh your GPS then.

259
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,787
I mean, you came to the wrong place.

260
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,624
How are you going to stack up any points
with runaway cows and pepper thieves?

261
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,794
Don't get your hopes up,
and relax here for a few years.

262
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,631
Where there are people,
there are violent crimes.

263
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,175
Why do you think there are
no "crimeless towns" anymore?

264
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,802
It's because people live there.

265
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,721
Huge cases are bound to happen,
be it murder or drugs.

266
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,558
Jeez. Why would you say that?

267
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,983
Such reckless words tend to come true.

268
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,318
Do you have a place to stay?

269
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,362
I'll get to that.

270
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,906
You're so clueless.

271
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,949
My goodness.

272
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,118
Are you going to sleep on the streets?

273
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,619
Deok-hee.

274
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,080
Help him find a room for himself.

275
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,883
What?

276
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,053
Whether you're here to buy something
or to ask me out, do it already.

277
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,930
-Ask whom out?
-Me.

278
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm here to rent a room.

279
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,727
Just a second.

280
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,854
Mom!

281
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,816
I've seen eyes like those
back at the Regional Investigation Unit.

282
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,445
My sister has quite a threatening face.

283
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,155
Is this your house?

284
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,490
"Ok-hui Deok-hee"?

285
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,077
You're looking for a big case, right?

286
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,042
My sister would've committed treason
if she'd been born in the Joseon Dynasty.

287
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,835
She has the face of a snake.

288
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,713
She's going to get into
huge trouble someday.

289
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,549
I'll show you to your room.

290
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,320
Your monthly rent is 450,000 won,
including water and electricity.

291
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,697
You don't have to pay a deposit
since you're a cop.

292
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,867
Good. I'll be in your care for a month.

293
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,997
He's going back to Seoul in a month.

294
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,082
Do you not see that?

295
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,085
LONG-TERM TENANTS WELCOME

296
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,462
Watch it.

297
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,922
Sorry.

298
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,382
Just don't be messy.

299
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,344
Also, I have a boyfriend.

300
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:30,275
Is she always that confident?

301
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,028
I wouldn't say she's confident.

302
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,365
More like batshit crazy.

303
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,326
You guys must really love each other.

304
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,203
Do you know why I became a detective?

305
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,793
One day, I'm going to cuff my sister
with my own hands

306
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,421
and throw her ass in jail.

307
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,050
That's why I became a cop.

308
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,554
You poor bastard.

309
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,974
Look how great you turned out
despite having a sister like that.

310
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,062
I can't stand her.

311
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:13,152
Auntie, shouldn't I get a CT scan
or an MRI for this?

312
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,654
You're just bruised.
Put some pain relief patches on.

313
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,574
Let me tell you.
I'd rather die than treat another cow.

314
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,411
Wake up.

315
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,746
You're the breadwinner of this household.

316
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,956
You have mouths to feed.

317
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,708
Bite the bullet and do it.

318
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,543
A cow kicked me, all right?

319
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,545
You could have ended up providing for me.

320
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,463
Our main income comes from cows.

321
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,424
How could you say you won't treat them?

322
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,717
I don't care!

323
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,052
You okay?

324
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,721
Everything hurts.

325
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,139
Dr. Bong.

326
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,976
-Hello.
-Ma'am.

327
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,811
What brings you here at this hour?

328
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,731
I'm a bit worried about Geumsil.

329
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,441
You know she's pregnant, right?

330
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,819
Yes, but she's not due yet.

331
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,989
Could you come with me?

332
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,450
Okay, wait here.

333
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,451
Okay.

334
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,707
Cows scare me.

335
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,002
You know what's scarier than cows?
Not having money.

336
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,879
Night examinations are double the fee.

337
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,300
Or you could ask your grandpa
if you could delay your next rent.

338
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,761
Fine, I'm going.

339
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,598
-My hip joints.
-Poor thing.

340
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,644
It's double the pay
for night examinations!

341
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,062
Have a safe trip!

342
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,818
The meteor shower will begin soon.

343
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,446
Perhaps I should go make a wish.

344
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,872
This is my cow's first calf.

345
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,335
She won't eat or sleep
the closer we get to her birth month.

346
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,795
And she cries every day.

347
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,549
I'll go and take a good look at her.

348
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,886
Hold on.

349
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,140
Where did all these cars come from?

350
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,814
Detective Na, come on over.

351
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,732
Something must've happened over there.

352
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,359
-Hurry. Get over there.
-Yes, sir.

353
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,069
Is this part of our job?

354
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,531
If you feel like this is too much trouble,
tell those meteors not to fall.

355
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,284
This is unimaginable in Seoul.

356
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:28,287
Well, that's a bit of a stretch.

357
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,707
Wait, what's that?

358
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,334
-Thank you!
-That thing prancing around like a deer.

359
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,378
That would be my sister.

360
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,587
Should I go arrest her?

361
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,007
Leave her be.
She's just trying to make a living.

362
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,633
Coming.

363
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,219
Here.

364
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,638
Mr. Park. Are you on your way
to see the meteors?

365
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,016
Hey, what are people saying
about me these days?

366
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,475
That you can't get anything right.

367
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,144
Who keeps spreading those rumors?

368
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,937
Why are you going to see the meteors?

369
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,897
MacArthur was a five-star general.

370
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,151
I'll get more powerful
once I go see those shooting stars.

371
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,569
You spread the word for me.

372
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,154
All right.

373
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,906
They're falling.

374
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,731
Can I have a name?

375
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,857
It's Gwang-sik.

376
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,650
Hey there, Gwang-sik.

377
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,860
No, that's my name.

378
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,281
She's Geumsil.

379
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,199
Okay.

380
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,326
Geumsil.

381
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,829
I'm going to take a look at you.

382
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,625
Don't get agitated, okay?

383
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,210
Okay.

384
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,256
Stay.

385
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,591
Stay still.

386
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,927
That's right.

387
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,014
You're anxious and scared, aren't you?

388
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,016
I'm scared too.

389
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,395
So let's call it even,
and let me properly examine you.

390
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,939
Attagirl.

391
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,964
Geumsil.

392
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,092
Your baby's heartbeat is normal,
and it's having fun in there.

393
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,510
It seems very healthy.

394
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,303
So you don't have to worry.

395
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:57,644
Now I'm going to examine you
with my hands.

396
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,021
You can trust me. We got this.

397
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,402
Mom.

398
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,492
Mom.

399
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,541
Mom.

400
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,168
Mom!

401
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,393
Ye-bun, are you okay?

402
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,772
I was so worried about you

403
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,566
-that I couldn't sleep or eat--
-Gross.

404
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,902
Swallow that food in your mouth.

405
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,862
What happened to you?

406
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,240
You've been asleep for three days
since that house call.

407
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,325
-What? Three days?
-Yes.

408
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,451
Did I faint or something?

409
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,161
How would I know?

410
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,043
I think I blacked out
after some kind of flash.

411
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,714
Hi, Meowie.

412
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,258
Come here.

413
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:55,387
Apparently, I was unconscious
for three days.

414
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,180
Were you worried about me?

415
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,932
Come here.

416
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,606
Hey, kitty. Come here. That's it.

417
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,566
There.

418
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,860
You can live with me from now on.

419
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,946
What was that?

420
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,555
What?

421
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,723
What did I just see?

422
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,271
Stop barking, Arfie.

423
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,775
Arfie.

424
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,652
What are you doing?

425
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,240
What was that? Come here.

426
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,799
I must be coming down with something.

427
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,844
-Ye-bun.
-Yes?

428
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,679
Give this to your aunt.

429
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,683
Hyeon-ok loves rockfish.

430
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,601
Sure.

431
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,820
-What's wrong?
-Did Ali catch this?

432
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,113
How did you know?

433
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,449
I should go see a doctor.

434
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,576
I'm going to go see a doctor.

435
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,661
What? What's going on with you?

436
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,000
But which doctor
should I even see for this?

437
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,667
Who is she?

438
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,919
-It's not like that.
-Tell me which skank it is!

439
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,256
-Stop it!
-How dare you come here!

440
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,675
Don't you dare come home, or else!

441
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,410
What is happening?

442
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,369
What was that?

443
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,711
Everything seems normal.

444
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,337
You're healthy.

445
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,423
That can't be.

446
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,217
Do you have any other symptoms?

447
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,763
The thing is, I'm seeing weird things.

448
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,431
You're seeing weird things?

449
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,225
Then do you want an appointment
with an ophthalmologist?

450
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,102
No. Not those kind of weird things.

451
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,150
I saw my puppy dropping its treat

452
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,943
and a chicken seeing a man get a bruise.

453
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,614
The rockfish. I saw it bite its bait.

454
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,367
I'll get you an appointment
with a psychiatrist.

455
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,594
What are you doing here? Come here.

456
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,471
What are you eating? Hey.

457
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,181
Come on, spit it out.

458
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,642
Arfie, say hi to Auntie Ok-hui.

459
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,560
Look over here. Good dog.

460
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,729
-Hi. There you go.
-Look at you!

461
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,855
It's me.

462
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,317
Okay, Arfie.

463
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,819
No, stay.

464
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,029
I'll be back soon. Stay here.

465
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,749
Arfie.

466
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,252
You happy?

467
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,672
This is driving me insane.

468
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,966
What's going on?

469
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,926
OK-HUI DEOK-HEE CORNER STORE

470
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,433
I need to get drunk.

471
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,695
Gosh, you lightweight.

472
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,406
You couldn't get past
the neck of the bottle.

473
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,161
Hey, how long was I asleep?

474
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,121
Three minutes.

475
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,456
You get drunk fast and get sober fast.

476
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,000
What? Did a guy dump you again?

477
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,586
Or did a friend try to get you
into a pyramid scheme?

478
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,546
Or did a guy
sell you insurance and then bail?

479
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,229
Hey, how long was I asleep?

480
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,607
You're just embarrassing yourself
at this point.

481
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,986
So what's wrong? Use your words.

482
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,821
Ok-hui.

483
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:52,327
I think I'm possessed by a spirit.

484
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
I think it would be weirder
if you weren't.

485
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,039
I'm not joking.

486
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:59,250
I think I'm actually possessed.
I keep seeing things.

487
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,418
Things like what?

488
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,338
When I touch animals, I see weird things.

489
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,797
Right. Their memories.

490
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,301
I think I see their memories
and see what they see.

491
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,471
I can see their whole lives in a panorama.

492
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,931
I have to close up. Go home.

493
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,766
I really think I'm possessed.

494
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,517
Then you should go see a shaman.

495
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,644
Why make a scene here?

496
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,813
A shaman?

497
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,232
-Hey, wait.
-Come on.

498
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,859
You're the one who suggested this.

499
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,444
I thought about it all night.

500
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,529
I fainted for no reason
and woke up after three days.

501
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,740
And I see weird things.
But the doctor says nothing's wrong.

502
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,617
Then what could it be other than this?

503
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,578
Let go of my hand and we'll talk. Let go!

504
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,829
My mom's a deacon.

505
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,165
She'd kill me if she found out.
So you go in and…

506
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,167
I'll be waiting here. So go ahead inside.

507
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,734
Sir, I…

508
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,862
Actually…

509
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,993
Is my one month up?

510
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
I can only play the preview.

511
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,454
Excuse me.

512
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,125
I keep seeing these weird--

513
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,292
Be quiet.

514
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,837
You don't have to tell me.

515
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,798
General MacArthur sees everything.

516
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,307
The general is here.

517
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:43,563
You recently fainted for no reason
and woke up after three days, didn't you?

518
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,234
And you see weird things,
but the doctor told you nothing's wrong.

519
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,945
How did you know?

520
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:55,658
Honey, what are you doing later?
Do you want to hang out with Ok-hui?

521
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,537
The air's so bad today. Don't you think?

522
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:04,083
Anyway, I guess you know
all about why I'm here.

523
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,627
So what's going on with me?

524
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,922
All right. Let's proceed to land.

525
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:14,385
Let's proceed to land to see what's wrong.

526
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,143
All troops,

527
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,853
proceed to land.

528
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,961
You've been visited by a deity.

529
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,256
You've been chosen.

530
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,174
What?

531
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,344
Chosen by a deity?

532
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes. It's your destiny to become a shaman.

533
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,058
Do I really have to do that?

534
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,811
No, you don't have to.

535
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,604
It's just…

536
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,272
You'll have some trouble.

537
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,233
You won't be able to date,
and even if you do, he'll die.

538
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,361
Either you or those around you
will get sick or hurt out of nowhere.

539
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,695
They may even die.

540
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,656
Really?

541
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,199
Why would that happen?

542
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,992
Look up my MeTube channel.

543
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,494
I explain the details there.

544
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,162
Like and subscribe while you're at it.

545
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,916
Go through the shaman rite of passage.

546
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,334
The sooner, the better.

547
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,462
How does that work?

548
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,091
First of all,
the fee is about 20 million won.

549
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,343
That much?

550
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,138
But that would be
a crazy amount to ask for.

551
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,975
If I use commercial straw cutters,

552
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,728
replace the seasonal fruits
with tropical fruits,

553
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,856
use recorded music for the percussion,

554
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,568
and then give you a discount for locals,

555
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,945
it would cost you this much.

556
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,240
I'll do my best, trust me.

557
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,580
I still don't think
becoming a shaman is the answer.

558
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,789
Thanks for your time.

559
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,419
Halt! General MacArthur
wants to give you a freebie.

560
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,760
I usually get paid for this.

561
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,097
But he'll make an exception
and tell you which deity chose you.

562
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,057
He can tell me that?

563
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,309
Well, of course.

564
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:31,731
He can tell whether the deity
is a general, bachelor, maiden, or baby.

565
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,234
You said that you're seeing things.

566
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,571
Tell me what you see.

567
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,032
I can't just see it.

568
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,074
Then how?

569
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,620
I think I can only see things
when I touch animals.

570
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,413
Only animals?

571
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,664
Yes.

572
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
Which deity would this one be?

573
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,591
That's Jane the goddess.

574
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,928
Who's Jane the goddess?

575
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,056
She's a friend of animals.

576
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,100
She's in Tarzan. You know, his girlfriend.

577
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,814
Give it a good thought.

578
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,442
Your family will get hurt
if you don't become a shaman.

579
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,862
I'll do my best.

580
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,240
WE HAVE ROOM FOR MONTHLY RENTERS

581
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,701
What did he say?

582
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,121
He said I should become a shaman.

583
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,707
-No way. Will you do it?
-I don't know.

584
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,709
Hey, honey.

585
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,544
K-pop dance?

586
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,798
Why would he learn
K-pop dance in Australia?

587
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,424
How much is it?

588
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,427
500 dollars? All right,
I'll send you the money.

589
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,722
I think I'll be performing a rite soon.

590
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,650
Crap. I can still see it.

591
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,361
Am I possessed by some animal spirit?

592
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,654
Auntie Hyeon-ok!

593
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,117
Father, oh my goodness.

594
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,618
-Careful.
-Watch his back.

595
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,371
What happened to him?

596
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,624
He rolled down the stairs
while campaigning for the election.

597
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,584
But he refuses to go to the hospital.

598
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,378
Thanks, Deok-hee.

599
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,629
It's nothing.

600
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,673
Call me if you need anything.

601
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,924
Thank you.

602
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,050
Don't mention it, sir.

603
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,804
Why did you have to get into
that election campaign?

604
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,682
You never cared about politics.
What's gotten into you?

605
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,311
Let me see.
I'll check if you broke any bones.

606
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,854
Forget it.

607
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,149
Hyeon-ok, help me with some
pain relief patches.

608
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,615
Yes. It's your destiny to become a shaman.

609
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,869
Either you or those around you
will get sick or hurt out of nowhere.

610
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,995
They may even die.

611
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,052
Where's your coat?

612
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,638
Auntie, I'm closing
the hospital for today.

613
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,057
What?

614
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,144
I sincerely thank you
for taking care of me this whole time.

615
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,731
What are you talking about?
And what's with all the formality?

616
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,530
You had it so hard for so long.

617
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,783
I sure did.

618
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,159
What did you say you craved?

619
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,870
I'm feeling weak these days,
so maybe some A-rated Korean beef?

620
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,373
Feel free to eat whatever you want.

621
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,958
Really? I can eat anything I want?

622
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,418
Yes, you can.

623
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,090
Where are you going though?

624
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,677
You'll find out about everything
after today.

625
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,105
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

626
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,440
Please have a long and healthy life.

627
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,809
You have to let go of everything
to become a shaman.

628
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,687
Release all the sorrow and rage
that you have inside you.

629
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:51,574
My dad died as soon as
I started elementary school.

630
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,451
When I was in high school,

631
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,911
my mom committed suicide.

632
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,915
My grandpa had been strongly
against their marriage.

633
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,084
But what could I do
when they both passed away?

634
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,544
I went to live with him.

635
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,923
I thought if I was a good girl,
he would like me. But he didn't.

636
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:12,011
I became a vet to get him to like me,
and I took over his hospital too.

637
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,554
But he still wouldn't accept me.

638
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:18,309
So I even got a loan
to redecorate the hospital

639
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,145
and turned it into one
that specializes in pet cats and dogs.

640
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,316
But we rarely get any patients,
and I'm now drowning in debt.

641
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,153
I had saved up some money
to get married and start a family.

642
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:34,033
But then I was visited by a deity,
so I spent it all on this rite.

643
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,661
Oh, my.

644
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,997
Why am I crying?

645
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,957
Is this because of estrogen?

646
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,133
What's this?

647
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,511
All great shamans walk on straw cutters.

648
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,596
Get on it.

649
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,556
Get on that?

650
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,768
I have to walk on those?

651
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,144
Yes. Just get on.

652
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,900
I mean, I've never learned how to do that.

653
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,862
The deity within you
will protect you from any harm.

654
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,113
Just get on.

655
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,656
Excuse me.

656
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,453
Could you…

657
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,249
Could you demonstrate it for me?

658
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,459
Me?

659
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,253
I'll watch and follow after you.

660
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:30,774
Don't people usually
get on those barefoot?

661
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,738
Yes.

662
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,534
Yes, they do!

663
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,874
General MacArthur is coming.

664
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,545
Proceed to land on the straw cutters.

665
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,534
Great sharpening skills.

666
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,880
Proceed to land on the straw…

667
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,512
Are you all right? Let me take a look.

668
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,931
-I cut myself.
-Oh no!

669
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,307
Get me some ointment!

670
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,392
-Oint…
-Here.

671
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,810
What? Okay.

672
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,479
I got cut.

673
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,571
By the way,

674
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,616
are you MacArthur right now? Or Mr. Park?

675
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,370
It was the general earlier,

676
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,788
and now it's me.

677
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,543
Then can you call the general for me?

678
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,045
-Now?
-Yes.

679
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,088
Hold on.

680
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,725
MacArthur here.

681
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,561
You wanted to talk?

682
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,284
Hi, I'd like to report
a credit card theft.

683
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,541
If you're MacArthur,
why can't you speak English?

684
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,669
And if you're MacArthur,
shouldn't you be in Incheon?

685
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,297
Housing is expensive there.

686
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,010
And I really did host
the spirit of General MacArthur.

687
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,305
But about ten years ago,

688
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,264
he left me.

689
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,682
Why?

690
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,310
Maybe he got homesick?

691
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,604
So why did you trick me?

692
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,148
I have to make a living, you know.

693
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,276
This is my work,
and I have to support my family abroad.

694
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,112
Whatever. Just give me back the money.

695
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,947
Let me have 500,000 won.

696
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,909
My kid wants to learn
K-pop dance in Australia.

697
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,577
Austra…

698
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,704
It doesn't make sense, does it?

699
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,081
I can't make sense of it either.

700
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,545
SPECIAL POWER THAT SHOWS YOU MEMORIES

701
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,422
A WOMAN USES HER PSYCHIC POWER
TO HELP POLICE CATCH A SERIAL KILLER

702
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,016
It was true.

703
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:55,812
The special power Nella Jones had
was called psychometry.

704
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,983
Psychometry refers to the ability
to see visions of past events

705
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:04,112
or events that will happen in the future
by touching related objects or people.

706
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:08,116
Its users are able to see these visions

707
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,119
without having witnessed
the events themselves.

708
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,039
Psychometry?

709
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,213
Then does it work on people too?

710
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,258
People?

711
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,718
I can see memories of people too?

712
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,522
So I can see people's memories too?

713
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,655
Touching someone out of the blue
would make me a pervert.

714
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,584
This is a god-given opportunity.

715
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,388
I'm sorry.

716
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,852
What are you doing?

717
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,121
I didn't see anything.

718
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,082
What's going on?

719
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,335
One more try, just to make sure.

720
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,925
You little…

721
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:52,721
Ye-bun.

722
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,639
Hi, Deok-hee.

723
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,058
-Ye-bun?
-Hi.

724
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,184
Oh, hello.

725
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,769
Dr. Bong? What brings you here?

726
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,480
-Come with me.
-Okay.

727
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,108
You're quite the celebrity.

728
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:07,903
Name.

729
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,404
Bong Ye-bun.

730
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,864
Age.

731
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,865
Thirty-five.

732
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:12,783
Job?

733
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,327
I'm a vet.

734
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,329
A vet?

735
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,583
This is all a misunderstanding.

736
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,834
He was a pickpocket.

737
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,920
So it's okay to grope pickpockets?

738
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,130
That's not what I mean.

739
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,591
I wanted to check
if he really was a pickpocket, so…

740
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,259
But why grope him?

741
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,931
You have no proof.

742
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,850
You can't prove that I groped him.

743
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:45,357
How could you arrest and cuff someone
without any proof of…

744
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,487
I guess you do have proof.

745
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,502
What?

746
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,337
You want to erase it?

747
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:08,922
No.

748
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,883
I'm just stretching.

749
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,598
Just confess to the crime
before I upload the video online.

750
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,980
Then I'll be very honest with you.

751
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,401
The thing is…

752
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,071
I'm psychic.

753
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,168
Never mind, I'm just an ordinary citizen.

754
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,174
Auntie!

755
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,551
-Yes?
-Auntie!

756
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,594
Auntie?

757
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,804
We have a problem.
Deok-hee called me and said

758
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,431
Ye-bun's been taken to the police station.

759
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,057
The police station? Why?

760
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,517
No idea. He said she was cuffed.

761
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,810
Cuffed?

762
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,821
Not this one.

763
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,577
I'm letting you go
since you're not a flight risk.

764
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,662
You'll be summoned once I find the victim.

765
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,876
Listen.

766
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,211
You'll come to regret this.

767
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,338
That's criminal threat.

768
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,756
I'm so sorry.

769
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,221
I didn't see anything
from touching a person.

770
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,181
Does it only work on animals?

771
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,351
LOTTERY TICKETS

772
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,836
It doesn't work.

773
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,046
Goodbye.

774
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,927
Actually, I'll have one of these.

775
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,349
It doesn't work on people
or on lottery tickets.

776
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,600
How useless.

777
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,734
Auntie!

778
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,153
Auntie?

779
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,448
Auntie…

780
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,619
She really is something.

781
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,205
What's all this mess? Where is she?

782
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,049
What year is this diary from?

783
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,844
1993?

784
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,305
It's more than 30 years old.

785
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,517
"I'm 21 years old."

786
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,520
-"The most important things to me…"
-The most important things to me

787
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,647
are Goodbye, Mr. Black and…

788
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,155
that guy.

789
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,492
JULY, 1993

790
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:51,728
Won Jong-muk!

791
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,980
Hyeon-ok.

792
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,237
At 25 and 21,

793
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,407
we dated and then parted ways.

794
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,745
And at 55 and 51…

795
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,586
we became enemies.

796
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,588
What are you doing here, Hyeon-ok?

797
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,967
Jong-muk, I'm here for Ye-bun.

798
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,885
She left. You should too.

799
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,887
-Let's talk.
-I have nothing to say.

800
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,390
But Jong-muk,

801
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,725
being with you like this

802
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,560
reminds me of the old days.

803
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,192
So this is a fencing sword.

804
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,737
We should play a game
since we're in uniform.

805
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:51,496
I'm not going to attack.
I'll just be blocking you.

806
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,707
If you make the green light
come on even once

807
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,670
by poking or slashing me
within three minutes, you win.

808
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,630
Let's make a bet.

809
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,757
Sure. Go ahead.

810
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,051
The loser grants the winner's wish.

811
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,595
Deal.

812
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,181
Three minutes.

813
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,278
It must be 11 p.m.

814
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,113
All lights out.

815
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:03,526
Why do you root for me?

816
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,278
Because…

817
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,699
you make me look forward to the future.

818
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,810
Green light.

819
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,106
You can do as you wish today.

820
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,791
Put her in a holding cell.

821
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,292
What? You can't do this.

822
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,920
Jong-muk!

823
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,424
BONG'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

824
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,600
Excuse me, sir.

825
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,687
-Hello.
-Hello.

826
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,021
Doctor.

827
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,022
Yes?

828
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:27,652
My dog still won't eat.

829
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,404
Still?

830
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,950
Those canned food that dogs like.

831
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,660
How much are they?

832
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,706
Why don't you just bring your dog
to the hospital?

833
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,422
And it just so happens that our hospital
has a promotion until today.

834
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,049
So I'm seeing patients free of charge.

835
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,678
Why don't you bring your dog right now
before we close?

836
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,305
-Is that so?
-Yes.

837
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:03,438
He hasn't been eating
or drinking water for the past few days.

838
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:08,067
He used to love walks.
But now he refuses to go out.

839
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,737
He just lies down all day.

840
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,198
I see. How old is he now?

841
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,367
He's 15 years old now.

842
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,662
I'll take a look at him.

843
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:32,383
His joints have weakened
and his muscle mass has decreased

844
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,968
because of his age.

845
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,012
But there's not much to worry about
other than that.

846
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,764
That can't be.

847
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,308
He used to have a huge appetite.

848
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:44,562
There has to be something wrong
when he's starved for days.

849
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,273
He must be really sick.

850
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,400
You have a point.

851
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:51,861
I'll take another look.

852
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:07,752
Let's get out there and work
to feed Deokgu.

853
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,222
Deokgu, you should eat too.

854
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,055
How is he?

855
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,770
Deokgu must have felt bad about
a lot of things regarding you.

856
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:16,571
He must have been sorry
that you have to work because of him.

857
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,408
He was sorry that he was taking your food

858
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,369
when you barely
had anything to eat either.

859
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,542
He's old, so he can't control
his bladder and bowels.

860
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,755
And he was sorry
that you had to clean up after him.

861
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,425
I think he was sorry

862
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,678
because he thought you kept getting ill

863
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,513
because of him.

864
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,814
Eat.

865
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,693
-So he didn't eat or drink water.
-Eat up.

866
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,904
Do you want to go for a walk?

867
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,157
And he just kept sleeping.

868
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,454
Because the quicker he dies,

869
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,499
the sooner you'll stop suffering.

870
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,714
Why, you dummy…

871
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,510
Why would you think like that?

872
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,265
You're the reason I'm still alive.

873
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,435
I have no reason to live aside from you.

874
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,606
If it weren't for you,

875
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,526
I would have no one to talk to,

876
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,947
and wouldn't care about what I ate.

877
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,034
But I eat a proper meal because of you.

878
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,164
I would be lying around like a corpse,

879
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,751
but I go outside thanks to you.

880
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,839
That's how I'm not any worse.

881
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,678
You're old too.

882
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:06,639
Not being able to control
your bladder and bowels

883
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,308
is natural.

884
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:18,526
Even God can't help me with my illness.

885
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:22,155
It's only natural to get ill
when you're old.

886
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:27,660
Don't think of yourself as a burden.

887
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,204
Just live your life…

888
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,459
and pass on a few days before I die.

889
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,253
That way,

890
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,214
I'll feel at peace when I go myself

891
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,674
after sending you off.

892
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,331
Sir, take this.

893
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,708
-Here.
-Goodness.

894
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,294
You shouldn't be giving me
all this for free.

895
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:19,712
It's fine.

896
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,089
Feel free to come back
if there are any more problems.

897
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,716
Thank you.

898
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,135
Bye, Deokgu.

899
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,471
Good boy.

900
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,609
I guess it's not totally useless.

901
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,152
Ye-bun.

902
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,987
Hey, Deok-hee.

903
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,159
What the…

904
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,912
What are you doing here?

905
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,707
He moved in upstairs.

906
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,584
He's our neighbor now.

907
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,502
What?

908
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,878
You better watch out.

909
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,005
I'm watching you.

910
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,676
Why do you keep talking to me
so disrespectfully?

911
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,136
Criminals don't get any respect from me.

912
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,764
-Let's go.
-All right.

913
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,152
Jeez, why are my arms so stiff?

914
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,530
So stiff…

915
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,995
Hey, hold steady!

916
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,914
Hold it!

917
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,652
What are you doing here?

918
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,112
Jang-yeol…

919
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,714
You dirty pervert!

920
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:18,599
BEHIND YOUR TOUCH

921
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,977
We hit the jackpot. How did you do this?

922
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,770
We're fully booked until lunch.

923
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:24,981
I'll bring in all the money
there is in Mujin.

924
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,232
Welcome.

925
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,317
His skin is like porcelain.

926
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,069
His face has "Seoul" written all over it.

927
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,904
I heard the guy in the rooftop room
is from Seoul too.

928
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,656
That guy just has "jerk"
written all over his face.

929
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,367
You remember Ted Chang,
who used to deal drugs?

930
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,660
He was last headed toward where you are.

931
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,413
Help me solve big cases,
improve my performance, and be reinstated.

932
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,039
That was rat poison, man.

933
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,669
Excuse me.
Make sure to keep your butt safe.

934
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,337
I'm sorry?

935
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,340
I told you. I'm psychic.

936
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,592
I can see everything
when I touch someone's butt.

937
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,261
I'm sorry!

938
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,304
Don't freak out.

939
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,889
It's a murder case.

940
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,141
Use live ammunition.

941
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:01,308
Shoot if you're threatened.

942
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,436
Freeze!

943
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:05,646
What the…

944
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:14,321
