1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,560
Line up and stand here.

2
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,760
Come on, bro.

3
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,560
Let's go to a Chinese restaurant.

4
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,280
You in the back, hurry up.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
Go inside.

6
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,400
Move, move, move.

7
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,400
Go.

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,200
Hurry.

9
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,640
Faster.

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,840
If you're ready,

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
make sure they're obedient and listen.

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
When told to greet someone, do it.

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,640
If told to smile, smile.

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,440
Did you hear me?

15
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,480
Boss.

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Look, there are a lot today, and they're really good.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,960
There are both boys and girls.

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,160
The boy, the one in white.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:53,880
Come here.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,040
You want to see the boy, right?

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Look here.

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,800
Say hello to the uncle.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Hello, uncle.

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,160
How about this one?

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,520
He looks too smart.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,360
Pick another one.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,680
Okay, let's look again.

28
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,320
Alright.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,080
You, come here.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,840
Come, look here.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Big brother.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
Where is this?

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,880
Big brother.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,480
She’s been hanging around outside the Meili Palace for several days.

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
I think there’s something suspicious about her.

36
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,560
So I brought her in.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,920
What’s wrong with me?

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,120
What’s the problem?

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
I’m from the Meili Palace.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Speak.

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,600
I work for Sister Lili.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
Whose person?

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,200
Sister Lili’s.

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,200
She’s definitely suspicious.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,920
What’s Sister Lili’s full name?

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,960
Sister Lili.

47
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Sister Lili is just Sister Lili.

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,400
How would I know?

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,600
I’m just a cleaner, boss.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,400
What’s your name?

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Cui Juan.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
How long have you been with Liu Kui?

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Liu Kui?

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,360
I don’t know who Liu Kui is.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
I really don't know.

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,640
Why did you go to Meiligong?

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
To look for work.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
What else could I do?

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
You don't know, boss?

60
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
I was locked up for fifteen days.

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,960
If I don't find work, I'll starve to death.

62
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
It's true.

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,640
What about the others?

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,600
I don't know, boss.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,760
I really don't know anything.

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,520
You...

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,320
You're the new boss.

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,120
Boss.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,640
I...

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,280
I'm really struggling right now.

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,440
I still have to support my kid.

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,280
Do you have any work for me?

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Boss.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,760
Please, have some mercy.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Really.

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
I'm begging you, boss.

77
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,360
Big brother.

78
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,160
Big brother.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
I really don't know, boss.

80
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
I'm just a cleaner.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,280
Boss

82
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,120
Have mercy

83
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,600
We have to move tonight

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
We really don't have enough people

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,440
There are so many children

86
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,240
There's a woman who looks pretty good

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
After it's all done

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,400
(sign language) Sell her too

89
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,240
Boss

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
Boss

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,320
Big brother

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,200
Help me, big brother

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Watch closely

94
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,560
Take her away

95
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:45,880
Get up

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Boss

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,960
Where are we going?

98
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
Where are we going, boss?

99
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,720
Where are we going, boss?

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
Searched both the person and the bag thoroughly.

101
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,840
Searched.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,440
Are you sure?

103
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,320
I'm sure.

104
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
No phone, right?

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
No.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,440
Come in.

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,320
Alright.

108
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,280
Hurry up, hurry up.

109
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,960
Don't look around.

110
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
The kitchen is right here.

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
We eat here.

112
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
Your only job is to cook.

113
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,640
Once the food is ready,

114
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,920
someone will come to pick it up.

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,960
You're only allowed to stay inside this room.

116
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,920
Don't go outside or wander around.

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
I know all this.

118
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,080
You know?

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,960
Yes, I know.

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,400
If you don't behave,

121
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,080
I'll throw you into the sea to feed the fish.

122
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Don't worry, boss.

123
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,560
Boss.

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Can I ask you for something?

125
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,160
Let me borrow a phone.

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,960
My husband is waiting for me at home.

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
I just want to call and let him know I'm safe.

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Just one minute.

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,920
Please, boss, have a heart.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,120
Please.

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
Thank you, boss.

132
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,320
I'll hold it.

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Turn on the amplifier.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's listen together.

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,360
Okay.

137
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,040
Hello?

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Hello?

139
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,680
It's her old man.

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,800
It's me.

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Where did you go, woman?

142
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,920
Aren't you coming home yet?

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,720
Yelling all day long, that's all you know how to do.

144
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,480
I've found a job.

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm not coming back.

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,240
What kind of job?

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
Does it pay well?

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
None of your business.

149
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm cooking.

150
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,000
The boss is really nice.

151
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
We hit it off right away.

152
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,560
Are you sure?

153
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,560
By the way,

154
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,360
Don't forget to bring in the fish at the end of the yard.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,840
Otherwise,

156
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,280
they'll go bad by tomorrow.

157
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,280
That's all for now.

158
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm busy, gotta go.

159
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,720
Hey, Xiao Sun.

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Old Zhao.

161
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,280
This time,

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
I'll definitely do it well.

163
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,560
I know.

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
Thank you, big brother.

165
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll leave right away.

166
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,600
You're seriously ill.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
It's nothing.

168
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm aware of my condition.

169
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,560
It will be over soon.

170
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,480
Take good care of her.

171
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,480
We'll wait for you.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't wait for me.

173
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
I...

174
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
can't go any further.

175
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,360
Why are you awake?

176
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,160
Are you afraid I won't come back?

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't worry.

178
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,720
This time, I will definitely come to get you.

179
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,640
You're lying.

180
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,520
Be good.

181
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
Go back.

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,600
Hurry, go back.

183
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,960
Brother Lai

184
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,240
How is it?

185
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
It's fine.

186
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,880
You lent her your phone to make a call.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,440
I just lent her my phone for one call.

188
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,720
Brother Lai

189
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
Sorry.

190
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,160
She just called her man.

191
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,920
I was watching from the side.

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
Nothing happened.

193
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,960
Have you forgotten the rules?

194
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760
No.

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
Give me your phone.

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,320
Hello, who is this?

197
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,400
Hello.

198
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,440
Is Cui Juan there?

199
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,920
Play a two-dot.

200
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,720
I don't know.

201
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Three characters.

202
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Pung.

203
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Do you know when she'll be back?

204
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,600
I don't know.

205
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,640
Who are you?

206
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,000
Hung up.

207
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,720
Good thing you reacted quickly.

208
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,360
From now on,

209
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,040
turn off both your phones.

210
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Okay.

211
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,800
Big brother.

212
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,080
What are you looking at?

213
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,640
Come here.

214
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
Take the dishes out.

215
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
Okay.

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,320
Here.

217
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,520
Take it over there.

218
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,640
Okay.

219
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,240
That way.

220
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,800
Take it over.

221
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

222
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,280
Gu Da

223
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
We found the vehicle that took Qi Chu away.

224
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
The license plate is Tai AM0427.

225
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
It exited at the Luhua Town exit on the Xingshi Expressway.

226
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
It disappeared after leaving the exit.

227
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,600
That girl is being too reckless.

228
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,080
Okay.

229
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,080
Keep following up.

230
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,720
Go to Luhua Town.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,720
Luhua Town.

232
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,640
Do you remember what Qi Chu said on the phone?

233
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,480
She said,

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,600
"The boss is really nice."

235
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
"They hit it off right away."

236
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,880
She said she hit it off with that person.

237
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,400
That should be the person we're looking for.

238
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,960
Xu Honglai.

239
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,720
And if we don't collect the fish today,

240
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
they'll spoil by tomorrow.

241
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh, right.

242
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
Don't forget to collect the fish at the courtyard entrance.

243
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,760
Otherwise, they'll all spoil by tomorrow.

244
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,440
Fish.

245
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,080
That means it's a place where fishermen and fishing boats operate.

246
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
It's more than that.

247
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
They'll spoil by tomorrow.

248
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,640
It means we have to act today.

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,880
The group might be gone by tomorrow.

250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,440
That's right.

251
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,360
Make a call.

252
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,760
Check those two phones.

253
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,720
They're definitely turned off.

254
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,840
Hello, Lin Shen.

255
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,600
Gu Da.

256
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
Search around Luhua Town

257
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,920
for all places where there are fishermen.

258
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,720
And request backup immediately.

259
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes.

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,280
The phone is turned off.

261
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,440
From now on, we can only rely on ourselves.

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
No.

263
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
We still have Qi Chu.

264
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,320
We still have Qi Chu.

265
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,000
Hurry up and pass the fish, quickly!

266
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:46,960
Bring it up quickly.

267
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Don't waste any more time.

268
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm off to work.

269
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,880
Big brother.

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
Here, Quan Ge.

271
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,080
What are you doing now?

272
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Huh?

273
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,840
Lai Ge just said to turn off your phone.

274
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,720
Why are you taking it out?

275
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,000
I was going to move the cargo...

276
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Move what?

277
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,320
Xiao Tang.

278
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,280
Come over and have a drink with Quan Ge.

279
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
I'm sitting.

280
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
You've worked hard.

281
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,320
Mumu.
