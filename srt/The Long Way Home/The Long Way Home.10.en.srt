1
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,480
Has Yang Dong's phone data been recovered?

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,800
Lin Shen said it will probably take another hour.

3
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,240
Hello?

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,200
Hello?

5
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,520
A'Kui.

6
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,800
- You need connections to get by in Taining. - Don't touch me.

7
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
So, is this still what you want?

8
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
I want it.

9
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Are we leaving or not?

10
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,480
Sorry.

11
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,960
These are the guests who attended that day.

12
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,520
And the list of all the reception staff.

13
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
You two will work as a team.

14
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,960
Each person gets one page.

15
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,320
Within twenty-four hours,

16
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,320
go through everyone on the list.

17
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,080
Taining University of Science and Technology.

18
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,440
Whoa.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,520
All these waiters are college students?

20
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,640
Did you check the phone numbers yesterday?

21
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,640
Qingmen District.

22
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,680
Then start from the addresses above.

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,040
Begin with the people in Qingmen District.

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,440
There must be twenty or thirty people in Qingmen District.

25
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,160
Is Liu Kui's girlfriend really among them?

26
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,640
Aren't we just looking for a needle in a haystack?

27
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
How can we find it if we don't dive in?

28
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520
What if we don't find it?

29
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,200
If we don't, then go through everywhere he's been in the past three years,

30
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,360
five years, or even ten years,

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,440
and check everyone he's come into contact with.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Huh?

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,320
What do you mean, "huh"?

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
Get moving.

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,080
Get to work.

36
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,040
Come on.

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Which one are you calling?

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Do you recognize this person?

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,840
No.

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,160
You might have attended a summit four years ago.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Take a look—have you seen this person before?

42
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,720
No, I haven't.

43
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,040
Thank you.

44
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,960
You're welcome.

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Ben.

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
Keep investigating.

47
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Still hasn't answered.

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Yao Lan is the only one we can't reach.

49
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,400
She hasn't answered the phone all day.

50
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
Anyway, it's close by.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Let's just go find her directly.

52
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,200
Liu Kui.

53
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:14,960
Over here.

54
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,680
That person up ahead.

55
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't run.

56
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,640
Be gentle.

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,480
Turn around.

58
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,920
Run.

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,760
What are you doing?

60
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,600
Who are you?

61
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,080
He's not the person I saw.

62
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,680
Sorry.

63
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay.

64
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,160
Thank you.

65
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Lin Shen is checking the nearby surveillance cameras.

66
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
If there's any news, he'll let me know right away.

67
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
If that person is Liu Kui,

68
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
he might have been hiding here all along.

69
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,560
Yao Lan.

70
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,960
Yao Lan.

71
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,320
Not here?

72
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,120
Help.

73
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,200
Help me.

74
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,880
Help me.

75
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:13,840
Help.

76
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Help me.

77
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,680
Zhao Zhi

78
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
What's going on?

79
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,040
The initial assessment suggests poisoning.

80
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
There is vomit inside the room.

81
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,960
And urine as well.

82
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,760
When we arrived, all three were already unconscious.

83
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Their bodies were curled up.

84
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
The symptoms were very painful.

85
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,280
Right here.

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,400
When we got here,

87
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,440
this door was ajar.

88
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
The doors and windows were intact.

89
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
There were no signs of deliberate damage.

90
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,600
Zhao Zhi

91
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,120
What about the valuables in the house?

92
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,400
None of them were disturbed.

93
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
We don't know if the money on the floor belongs to the perpetrator

94
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,840
or to the two girls.

95
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,720
What about the poison?

96
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
We're investigating.

97
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,160
But just now, in the bathroom,

98
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,640
I smelled a faint scent of bitter almonds.

99
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,040
Cyanide.

100
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
That's the preliminary assessment.

101
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,120
We'll need to wait for the toxicology results for confirmation.

102
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,280
Forensic Doctor Zhou

103
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,640
Please test this razor.

104
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:16,920
Okay.

105
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,800
Do you have a question?

106
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,160
On our way here,

107
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,760
we ran into someone who looked like Liu Kui.

108
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,120
And then?

109
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
We followed him for three blocks.

110
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,400
But we still lost him.

111
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Zhao Zhi

112
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,080
How is it?

113
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,600
The razor found in Yao Lan's room has been tested.

114
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,160
It does belong to Liu Kui.

115
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,480
He got away again.

116
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,000
Hello

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Got it

118
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,640
Resuscitation for Yao Lan was unsuccessful

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,160
She is dead

120
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,880
The first autopsy begins now

121
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,840
The livor mortis is dark purplish-red

122
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
Located on the neck

123
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,280
Back

124
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
And also

125
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,640
The dorsal side of the limbs

126
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,200
Small petechial hemorrhages are seen on the outer side of the right upper eyelid conjunctiva

127
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
Right lower eyelid

128
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,520
Bulbar conjunctiva is pale

129
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,760
Nail beds are bluish-purple

130
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Mouth and nose

131
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,080
Wait

132
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,640
What's with the mouth and nose?

133
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,160
Take a look

134
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
There is fine white foam at the mouth and nose

135
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Mushroom-shaped foam

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
She drowned

137
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,800
I still need to examine the internal organs

138
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,840
If there is a large amount of fluid in the lungs

139
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,160
That would mean the cause of death is not poisoning

140
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,960
It's drowning

141
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,240
So she might have been poisoned first.

142
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,560
And then drowned afterward.

143
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,080
But when the poison took effect,

144
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,280
we were chasing Liu Kui.

145
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,400
He couldn't have come back to drown her, could he?

146
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,640
Yao Lan, twenty-five years old.

147
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
Ning Ruirui, twenty-three years old.

148
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
Both are from the Communication Department at Taining University.

149
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
They are graduate students.

150
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,560
They rent an apartment together.

151
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,520
This male student is named Wu Cong.

152
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,000
He is from the Bioengineering Department at Taining University.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,960
He is also a graduate student.

154
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Wu Cong and Ning Ruirui

155
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,920
have already undergone gastric lavage.

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,600
But they are still not out of danger.

157
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,760
Three people were targeted at once.

158
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,760
This Liu Kui...

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,240
There's no evidence.

160
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,160
Don't jump to conclusions.

161
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,400
First, investigate the social connections of the three.

162
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,240
Yes.

163
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
Officer Gu

164
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
You became a team leader at such a young age.

165
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,200
Are you married?

166
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
Is everything good at home?

167
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
Everything's good.

168
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,280
Let's get to the main topic.

169
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,200
Oh.

170
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,120
Let's sit inside, then.

171
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
I prefer standing outside.

172
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
That's fine too.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Officer Gu, here's the situation.

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
In our neighborhood,

175
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
the residents are quite mixed.

176
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,680
And there are no security cameras.

177
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
So usually,

178
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
we rely on neighbors to watch out for each other.

179
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Mm.

180
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,240
This is what our neighborhood committee has compiled over the past few days.

181
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,120
It's about the social connections of Yao Lan and Ning Ruirui.

182
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,160
Please keep it safe.

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,640
Mm.

184
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,160
Auntie, what you’ve put together is really detailed.

185
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,520
It’s even more detailed than our internal network.

186
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
There are notes and categories too.

187
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
It’s all thanks to the power of the community.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
What you police can’t find,

189
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
we can always ask around and find out.

190
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,840
That’s right.

191
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,360
Rely on and unite the people, right?

192
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Those two have a really good relationship.

193
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,120
Yeah.

194
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,760
It’s what you young people call “mi” or something.

195
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,720
Best friends.

196
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,960
Yes.

197
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
That’s the “mi” I meant.

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,320
They grew up together since they were little.

199
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,960
They lived together from middle school all the way through graduate school.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
What about Wu Cong?

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
What’s their relationship?

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,080
You mean that handsome young man?

203
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,680
Yeah.

204
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,920
I’m not too sure about that.

205
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,640
Well,

206
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
What’s wrong?

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
It’s about the day when the incident happened.

208
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,760
I saw him standing downstairs for a long time before going up.

209
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,360
He stood there for a long time.

210
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,600
Is there anything else?

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,480
That's all for now.

212
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
Let me finish studying this first.

213
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
Zhao Zhi.

214
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
I also visited Wu Cong's school.

215
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,800
Everyone says Wu Cong only ever

216
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
does experiments and writes papers.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
He has no hobbies.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,400
And no friends.

219
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,480
He has no connection with Yao Lan or Ning Ruirui either.

220
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,640
As for why he showed up at their house that day,

221
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
everyone finds it strange.

222
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,600
Take a look at this article.

223
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,520
Research on Improved Extraction of Cyanide from Wastewater.

224
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,960
Author: Wu Cong.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
Ma'am, please don't be nervous.

226
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,680
We're just here to ask some routine questions.

227
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Please have a seat.

228
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,640
Do you recognize this magazine?

229
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
Your son is very talented.

230
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,880
He published a paper in it.

231
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,080
He even won an award.

232
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
He studied cyanide.

233
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,840
What do you mean by that?

234
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,840
Are you suspecting my son of poisoning?

235
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm just asking.

236
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,080
He's still in a coma right now.

237
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,200
You think he poisoned someone?

238
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,480
Is this your evidence?

239
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
Is this what you police think?

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
My son is a victim.

241
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,760
A victim.

242
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
He's not the culprit.

243
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
Ma'am, please calm down.

244
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
We're just conducting a routine interview.

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,320
I have nothing more to say to you.

246
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,360
It's all my fault.

247
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,480
It's all my fault.

248
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,160
Wu Cong is awake.

249
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,440
Let's go.

250
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
Cong Cong, say something.

251
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,200
Don't scare your mom.

252
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,400
Wu Cong.

253
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you remember what happened that day?

254
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,240
Why did you go there that day?

255
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,720
To Yao Lan and Ning Ruirui's house?

256
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
What is your relationship with them?

257
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,000
What else could it be?

258
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,080
My son went to see his girlfriend.
