1
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
Little ones,

2
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
Wow.

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,280
You’re here.

4
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,640
Here.

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,840
Save one more for me.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,240
It’s so cool.

7
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
Wow, it’s huge.

8
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,200
What a big boat.

9
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,240
It’s so big.

10
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
A Lai said,

11
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
Aunt Gui calls you the Five Tigers.

12
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,720
The Five Tigers.

13
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
We also heard about your brother.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Brother.

15
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,320
We made it.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,160
After we finish with Tang Cheng and get the gold,

17
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,320
good days will come.

18
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,920
Xiao Jiang said,

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
once we have the gold,

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
we can live a good life.

21
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
We got the gold,

22
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
but lost the people.

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
You police,

24
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,520
searching everywhere for the truth every day.

25
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
Where is the truth?

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
This is the truth.

27
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,000
Where is the truth?

28
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,760
There is a truth.

29
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,720
The truth we police have found is

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,560
you are all victims.

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,440
Give it to me after you pick it up.

32
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
Come on, come on, come on.

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,280
Pick up anything you find.

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,800
Alright, let's go.

35
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Mom.

36
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,200
Look.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
I found a bag.

38
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,640
Such a big basin.

39
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,000
I picked up a bag.

40
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,480
That's great.

41
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Really great.

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,160
Scrap.

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,440
Coming.

44
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,000
-Come here. -Time for buns!

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,680
Time for buns!

46
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,480
Buns.

47
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,760
Buns.

48
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
Want to eat?

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,640
Of course I do.

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Who wouldn't?

52
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
Do you have money?

53
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,640
You can trade things for it.

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,120
Really?

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,880
Here.

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,760
Here.

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,360
Mm.

59
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
This one.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Trade for a meat one.

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,520
Come.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Here.

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,360
This one.

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,080
Trade for a vegetarian one.

65
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Is this okay?

66
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,080
This one.

67
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
It can't even be traded for a bun.

68
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
Can anything be traded?

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,880
Of course.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,320
If it's a thing, it has a price.

71
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,840
I don't understand.

72
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
What I mean is,

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,200
as long as you have the guts,

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,920
there's nothing you can't trade for.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,320
If you come empty-handed,

76
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,000
then you'll just go hungry.

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,200
Then,

78
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
do I have a price?

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,720
Everyone has a price.

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm not some victim.

81
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,320
You killed Yang Dong.

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,600
Yes.

83
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Brother Hai.

84
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,320
Since we've started,

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
don't stop.

86
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,880
Definitely don't

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,200
let them go.

88
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,560
Brother.

89
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,680
Come on.

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,360
Finish me off.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,440
Fourth Brother.

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
You go first.

93
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,480
You killed Liu Kui too.

94
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
It was me.

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,400
Xu Honglai and Zhang Guiping were your targets too.

96
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
If you had come a few minutes later,

97
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,880
I would have succeeded.

98
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,360
If we had come a few minutes later,

99
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,560
what about Xiao Gu?

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,640
Can you protect her?

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
She's my daughter.

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,840
Do you want your daughter to end up like you?

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,680
She's not like me.

104
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
She will have a lot.

105
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,480
A lot.

106
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
You have a lot too.

107
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,760
Luo Haixiao.

108
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,360
You have a lot too.

109
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Luo Haixiao.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,640
Even though you are orphans,

111
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,000
that is not an excuse for your crimes.

112
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
You can see your daughter.

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
Why don't you cherish it?

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Why?

115
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,240
Dad, Dad, my gorilla is missing!

116
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,200
It must have gone out to play again.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,520
Please help me find it quickly.

118
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,560
Does it still hurt?

119
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
Yeah.

120
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,560
It won't hurt for much longer.

121
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,720
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life.

122
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
Dad is a bad person.

123
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,280
You're different.

124
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
You should be a good person.

125
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,200
Remember that.

126
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,360
Are you sleepy?

127
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,280
Yeah, I am.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Go to sleep.

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Then I'll really sleep.

130
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
Go ahead and sleep.
