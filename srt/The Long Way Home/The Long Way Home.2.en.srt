1
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,080
You need to go back to Taining.

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Mom told you to go back.

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
Yang Dong has been released from prison.

4
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,160
Mom asked me to go back and get something from him.

5
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,960
It's been hidden for eight years.

6
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,840
It's time to bring it out.

7
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,760
Yang Dong, something happened.

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Police inspection.

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,760
Everyone inside, come out.

10
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
Welcome, Director Du.

11
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Our conditions here are limited.

12
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
The meeting room is ready.

13
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,640
All the materials are inside.

14
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's go this way.

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Alright, let's make the most of our time.

16
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,280
Okay.

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,920
Mm, alright.

18
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
After discovering Liu Kui,

19
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Comrade Zhao Shi

20
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,200
immediately reported to the command center.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,440
He also requested an immediate operation.

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,240
We decided right away to initiate the arrest plan.

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,960
And we notified the Xiaguan team to assist.

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,160
Due to information gaps,

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,680
your district's security team had already gone to that area

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
to carry out an anti-vice operation.

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
These unexpected overlaps

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,200
led to last night's misunderstanding.

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:04,880
Director Du,

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,920
Director Guo,

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,760
last night we received a public tip-off

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
about prostitution at Meiligong.

33
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
We conducted a surprise inspection.

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
It affected your operation.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
I apologize to you.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
It's all for work.

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,640
I understand.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Although last night

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,400
we didn't catch Liu Kui on the spot,

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
eight trafficked women

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,600
were successfully rescued by us.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
This achievement is enough to show

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that our operation is on the right track.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,240
Next,

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,960
the Xiaguan team will fully cooperate with the task force.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,800
Director Guo,

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
I'd like to request someone from you.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
This is the person you're looking for.

49
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,840
Sorry about that.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,480
Sorry you had to spend the night here.

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Liu Kui is the one you let get away, right?

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,640
What happened with Team Leader Zhao yesterday was just a misunderstanding.

53
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
But don't worry about catching Liu Kui.

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
I'll definitely catch him.

55
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,160
Catching Liu Kui is our task force's responsibility.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
We won't trouble you with it.

57
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
What's with that attitude?

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
Right now,

59
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,640
we're short on time and have a heavy workload.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,520
We're short-staffed.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
That Gu Xinhe,

62
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,800
was last year's provincial skills competition fighting champion.

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960
Think about it.

64
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
Should we bring him in?

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,440
Huh?

66
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,800
Why are you all just standing there?

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,800
The food's getting cold.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,840
Wasn't Xiao Zhou supposed to assist me last night?

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,560
Why did it end up being Qi Chu?

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
I submitted a report.

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,800
Director Du approved it.

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,760
Reason?

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,440
I have to be there to catch Liu Kui.

74
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,680
What do you mean you have to be there?

75
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,600
Do you know why we sent Xiao Zhou?

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Because she's skilled.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,560
If something goes wrong,

78
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,280
she can handle it.

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
What can you do?

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,520
If it hadn't been for Gu Xinhe yesterday,

81
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm talking about you right now.

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Qi Chu, you're a sketch artist.

83
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
You're not meant for the front line.

84
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
Take the money and buy a ticket.

85
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Leave Taining.

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,760
I'm not leaving.

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,000
Say that again.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
I said I'm not leaving.

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,800
That's an order.

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,840
Stop being so stubborn.

91
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,880
This is about catching Liu Kui.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,080
And you stop acting all high and mighty.

93
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,920
Do you want me to hit you?

94
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,320
Come on.

95
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,760
Fine.

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,440
Enough.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Are you done yet?

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
That's enough.

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
Fighting among ourselves, aren't you ashamed?

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Director Du.

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Meeting.

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,920
Okay.

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,640
Zhao Shi, come with me.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,960
Talk.

105
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
What do you want to know?

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,880
How do you operate specifically?

107
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
We only supply goods to Liu Kui.

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
We usually go to the job market.

109
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,160
Pick some girls who just arrived in the city.

110
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,880
I want to go home, I want to go home.

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
Where did you sell those people?

112
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Abroad.

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,120
Wu Su.

114
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,520
How many people have you transported?

115
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
About twenty or thirty.

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,320
Twenty or thirty people.

117
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,840
What's the exact route?

118
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,880
Who is the contact person?

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
I really don't know.

120
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
As soon as they leave the Meili Palace,

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
everything else

122
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
has nothing to do with me, Ma Li.

123
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,520
Put your hand down.

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,120
Speak.

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm responsible for transporting people to Wangshan Port.

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,000
Matters outside the border

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
are handled by another group.

128
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,400
But this time

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,600
What's different this time?

130
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,040
What happened?

131
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,760
This time,

132
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
Liu Kui isn't just here for the deal.

133
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
It seems

134
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,960
he's also looking for someone.

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Looking for someone?

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,720
Who?

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,880
Yang Dong.

138
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
Business is done.

139
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
Let's talk about us.

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,760
Where is Yang Dong?

141
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,040
How would I know where he is?

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,400
I was about to ask you the same.

143
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,320
Why are you getting nervous talking about your old flame?

144
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,160
I've had plenty of old flames.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Yang Dong was never my type.

146
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
But you,

147
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,520
where is he?

148
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,840
I don't know.

149
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
Today, I'm not just taking the goods.

150
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
I'm also taking Yang Dong.

151
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,040
If I don't see him,

152
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,120
I'll have to sell his woman too.

153
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,040
I'll leave after I check the goods.

154
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Should I take Yang Dong or you?

155
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,920
You decide.

156
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,840
I'm the one hiding Yang Dong.

157
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,080
He said

158
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,280
no one can find him.

159
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
I want to go home.

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,280
Let's see who dares to run today.

161
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,320
Yang Dong

162
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,680
Why is Liu Kui looking for him?

163
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,320
I don't know.

164
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Go ask him yourself.

165
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Check.

166
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,920
Yes.

167
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
The number you have dialed is powered off.

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,960
Please try again later.

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
Old Fourth

170
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
Long time no see.

171
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,960
Big Brother

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,440
It's been eight years.

173
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
It's not that bad.

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,280
No one bullied you in there all these years, right?

175
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,160
They wouldn't dare.

176
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,800
This is the result of the Xinhe interrogation.

177
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,720
The owner of Meili Palace is Ma Li.

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
She had a boyfriend ten years ago.

179
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,360
His name is Yang Dong.

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,080
In 2002, Yang Dong

181
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,200
was sentenced to eight years in prison for intentional assault.

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,000
He was released a month ago after serving his sentence.

183
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,640
According to Liu Kui's bodyguard,

184
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Liu Kui returned to the country this time

185
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
specifically to look for Yang Dong.

186
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,360
Why is he looking for him?

187
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,120
That is still unknown at the moment.

188
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
But according to Ma Li,

189
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
it seems that Yang Dong

190
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,800
doesn't want Liu Kui to find him.

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
One is searching, the other is hiding.

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,040
Now things are getting interesting.

193
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,360
When we arrived at Meili Palace last night,

194
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,000
Yang Dong escaped in the chaos.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,120
His whereabouts are currently unknown.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,280
His address is listed here.

197
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
Check it as soon as possible.

198
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,480
Understood.

199
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,240
Sorry.

200
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Our resources are limited.

201
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,760
The task force will have to use this old records room for now.

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,520
We'll have to make do.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,400
It's fine.

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,200
You were the one who called the police, weren't you?

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Your own woman is stupid.

206
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,400
She can't even clean up her own mess.

207
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,560
Since you're out now,

208
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,280
why don't you come home?

209
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
Mom has been looking for you.

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,880
I have a home now.

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Have you gone stupid from being locked up?

212
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,680
Did you even forget who you are?

213
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
Brother,

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
it's been eight years.

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,000
I was inside for eight years.

216
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't want to get into that kind of trouble again.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,920
If you don't want trouble, hand over the stuff.

218
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
Hand it over and there won't be any trouble.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,560
I've always taken the blame for everything since we were kids.

220
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,520
Why do you always think I'm the one who took it?

221
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,840
Fourth, you've never been able to lie since you were little.

222
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Brother,

223
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,040
I really don't know.

224
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,240
I didn't take it.

225
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,640
Enough.

226
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,160
Fine, I took it.

227
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,560
Come on, then.

228
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,640
Where is it?

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't recognize it.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
You're driving me crazy.

231
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,520
Looks like your task force is short-staffed.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Director Guo already said,

233
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,880
we'll fully cooperate with you.

234
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,440
If you need anything, just ask.

235
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,600
Don't be polite.

236
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,520
Biscuits.

237
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,440
Honestly, I didn't prepare anything either.

238
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,560
Why are we going to Hongxing Village anyway?

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,280
Zhao Shi.

240
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,640
Hello, Chief Zhao.

241
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,760
This is Xiao Guo from Hongxing Police Station.

242
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
The boss said you're looking for Yang Dong.

243
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,280
Yes.

244
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
We're coming to your station now to get some information.

245
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,400
Have him come over too.

246
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,320
To assist with the investigation.

247
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
But Yang Dong is already dead.

248
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
Dead?
