1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,600
Cheers.

2
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,400
Mr. Chen.

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,360
The thing you asked for.

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

6
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,520
Did you find anything?

7
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,720
We found that Dai Qi owns another property.

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,320
I just confirmed with Chen Zhengwei.

9
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,720
He had no idea Dai Qi had this apartment.

10
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,440
He doesn't know?

11
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,160
That's right.

12
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,200
Dai Qi is probably hiding something else.

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,080
Why are you still here?

14
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,560
Where should I go?

15
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
Haven't I already joined the task force?

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,640
Who agreed to that?

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
No way, Zhao Zhi.

18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,720
I drew sketches and helped you catch people.

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
And now you want me to leave?

20
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,640
You've finished your task, thank you.

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
I drew Wang Ziyan.

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,760
That was my condition for joining the team.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,000
You promised.

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,520
Did I?

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,200
You did.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,880
I don't think so.

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,680
You did.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,720
No.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,400
You don't.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,280
- I can't remember, I can't remember. - They're here, everyone's here.

31
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,320
Come on, excuse me, excuse me.

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,600
What are you doing?

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,560
Let go.

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,320
What are you doing?

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,840
Careful, careful.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,320
Slow down, slow down, everyone slow down.

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,280
Look at our team, so many people!

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,200
Why just our team?

39
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
What do you mean by that?

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,720
Zhao Zhi.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
If you need anything else, just say it.

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,080
Don't be polite.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,600
No need to be polite.

44
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,240
Go out, go out.

45
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's get another water dispenser.

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
No need, no need.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,320
Go get the one from the meeting room.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,840
Of course.

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,280
Zhao Zhi.

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Hey, don't block the way, don't block the way.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,120
Be careful. Why don't you sit for a bit?

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,760
Just make yourself at home.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,560
Sit for what?

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Don't be shy.

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
Your place, huh?

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,160
You guys are busy, I won't bother you.

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,680
You guys go ahead.

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,720
Zhao Zhi, leave it to us.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Alright, don't worry.

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,280
Qi Chu.

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,840
Alright, didn't expect you to be so capable.

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,120
What should we compete in next time?

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,400
Just put it in this basket.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,880
Put it here.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,440
I'll just sit here.

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Look at our environment.

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Pick a spot.

68
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,120
Ms. Daiqi is the resident of unit 1805.

69
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,040
It's a small two-bedroom apartment.

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,120
But she doesn't stay there often.

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,760
She only comes back about once a week.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
Does she usually come back alone?

73
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
No.

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,320
She usually comes back with a man.

75
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,000
That man

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,640
is quite young.

77
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,120
Is it this person?

78
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes.

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,520
That's him.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,840
Is there any surveillance footage of the two of them?

81
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,960
I'd like to confirm.

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,760
No problem.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Here is all the lobby surveillance from last month at night.

84
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,200
Take your time to look through it.

85
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,840
That's not right.

86
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,720
What's wrong?

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,880
This isn't Wang Ziyan.

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,160
Are you sure?

89
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm sure.

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,760
Because of the neck.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
The neck?

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,040
This guy's neck

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,640
is practically sticking into his chest.

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
You can tell from that?

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,880
At first glance, his height and build are similar to Wang Ziyan's.

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,720
But a person's shoulders, neck, and facial features

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,960
all have fixed proportions.

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Are you saying

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960
that besides Wang Ziyan,

100
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,000
there's another man?

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,520
If you go by the neck in the video

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,080
and the outline of the shoulders,

103
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
this person's face shape

104
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,120
You mean, with this head-to-shoulder ratio,

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
it's impossible for him to have Wang Ziyan's face.

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,400
Right.

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,080
His face shape should be closer to the one I drew.

108
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,600
It should be a bit wider than Wang Ziyan's.

109
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,000
If the face is wider,

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
the facial features will be more spread out.

111
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,360
The sketch is done.

112
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
He should look like this.

113
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,120
I've seen this person before.

114
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Thank you for your cooperation.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
Qichu, are you sure it's him?

116
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
I'm sure, there's no mistake.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,640
But I've checked.

118
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,600
The week Wang Ziyan had the incident,

119
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
Li You wasn't in Taining.

120
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,560
That's not important.

121
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Then what is important?

122
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,160
What's important is,

123
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,040
since this Manager Cai

124
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,960
could betray Wang Ziyan to Dai Qi's husband,

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,800
why didn't he mention Li You at all?

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,600
Li You.

127
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
Senior personal trainer.

128
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Five years of experience.

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,760
His motto is "Charm only comes from exercise."

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
There's only one explanation now.

131
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,680
It's that Li You and Manager Cai

132
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,760
aren't working together.

133
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
They're working together.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
They've always been working together.

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
It does look similar.

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,000
When I checked the attendance sheet last time,

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
I noticed

138
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,680
there are clients

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,280
who would book six consecutive private lessons with Li You

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,360
for a total of six hours

141
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Li You couldn't just be teaching during that time

142
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,120
In Manager Cai's office

143
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,640
there are five or six bottles of perfume

144
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,800
each costing over a thousand yuan

145
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,120
The letters on them probably represent different clients

146
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,480
This is how they cater to their targets' preferences

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,120
And those hard drives and camera lenses he bought

148
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,440
are standard equipment for secret filming and blackmail

149
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,640
In summary

150
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
their plan should go like this

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,360
The two of them first look for wealthy female clients in the store as targets

152
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,560
especially those who are married

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,560
then lure them into compromising situations

154
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Yes, good, that's fine

155
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,760
But

156
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,920
your upper arm

157
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
needs to stay close to your body

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Yes, go ahead

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,160
Pull it down a bit more

160
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,920
Li You seduces the clients to get luxury gifts

161
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Then Manager Cai uses videos and photos to blackmail them

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,160
As for the money

163
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
they either extort the client directly

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,040
or sell the material to the woman's husband

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
in exchange for hush money

166
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Thank you

167
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
They're basically profiting from both sides

168
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
But I don't understand

169
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,680
what role Wang Ziyan plays in all this

170
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,880
What part does she play?

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
What is certain is

172
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,400
Wang Ziyan is the variable in this situation

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Hello.

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,200
Where is Li You?

175
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,520
He went out last night.

176
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
He hasn't come back yet.

177
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,040
He was out all night?

178
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,720
Where is he?

179
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
I don't know.

180
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
Anyway, he seemed pretty happy when he left.

181
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,320
He said—

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh.

183
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,520
He went to get back together with his girlfriend.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,160
Dai Qi.

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,600
Let's go.

186
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
Coming.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
Who is it?

188
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Who is it?

189
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
Where's Dai Qi, Auntie?

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,560
She's not here.

191
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,720
Where did she go?

192
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,240
I don't know.

193
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,840
What's going on?

194
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Phone call.

195
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Gu Da.

196
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
The alarm at Chen Zhengwei's warehouse went off.

197
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
There's an alert for unauthorized entry.

198
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,160
Okay.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,520
It should be her.

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,080
Let's go.

201
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,640
Hurry.

202
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,440
You’re really noisy.

203
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,440
Here.

204
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,720
This is your favorite, right?

205
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,920
So you lied to me, didn’t you?

206
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,120
You burned Yan Yan to death.

207
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,040
Today I’m going to burn you.

208
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
Daiqi, stop!

209
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,000
Don’t come any closer.

210
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,040
Do you believe I can burn him to death?

211
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,840
Calm down, Daiqi.

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,640
Put it down.

213
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
Speak.

214
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
Was it him who burned Wang Ziyan?

215
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,120
Put it down first.

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,520
Say something.

217
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,360
Speak!

218
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,200
Don’t worry.

219
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,960
We’ll definitely find out the truth.

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
Put the candle down first.

221
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,000
Don’t forget,

222
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
you still have a child.

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
Don’t use my child to threaten me.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
I’m not just a mother.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
I’m also a woman.

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
I am myself.

227
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,400
I have a name.

228
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,560
My name is Daiqi.

229
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,320
Okay.

230
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,760
Daiqi.

231
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
I know.

232
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Chen Zhengwei has been hurting you all along.

233
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
He hits you.

234
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,040
He abuses you.

235
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
Isn’t that right?

236
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,320
Chen Zhengwei is just an animal.

237
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,200
Yes.

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,880
He really is an animal.

239
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,960
But Daiqi,

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,840
for a man like that,

241
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
turning yourself into a demon

242
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,200
isn't worth it.

243
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,200
Give me the candle.

244
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,200
Alright.

245
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,160
A man?

246
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
He stopped being a man a long time ago.

247
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,360
Ever since he broke his leg,

248
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,000
he's been useless.

249
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,560
He couldn't do anything anymore.

250
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
He can't do anything now.

251
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
So if that's the case,

252
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
why can't I let myself be a little happier?

253
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
But Wang Ziyan is different.

254
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,520
Wang Ziyan cares about me.

255
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
He knows how to love me.

256
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,880
He truly protects me.

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,600
Stop drinking.

258
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Let go.

259
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
It's fine.

260
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,080
But now there's nothing left.

261
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,800
It's all gone.

262
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,760
I know.

263
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
But give me the candle first.

264
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,000
Calm down.

265
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,040
Okay?

266
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,280
It's gone.

267
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,160
Let go.

268
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,000
Calm down.

269
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,000
Dai Qi

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,480
She was a big catch that Cai and I reeled in.

271
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,520
She’s the kind of person

272
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,160
who’s especially emotional.

273
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,440
She’s impulsive.

274
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
She spends money recklessly too.

275
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,520
But not long after I got her,

276
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,120
she fell for Wang Ziyan.

277
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
Wang Ziyan is with you, right?

278
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
No.

279
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,040
He’s just a regular receptionist.

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,080
True love?

281
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
Do you guys even believe in that?

282
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,640
If those two are really in love,

283
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,480
then what am I?

284
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,480
Doesn’t that mean all my efforts were for nothing?

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,800
And then?

286
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,360
Later,

287
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,160
Cai said that kid was blocking our money.

288
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,560
He had to be dealt with.

289
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,920
He didn’t want me involved in this.

290
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
He said he could handle it himself.

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,160
After that, I really don’t know what happened.

292
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
You mean

293
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,080
the mastermind behind this is Cai Gang?

294
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,360
Manager Cai.

295
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,200
Yes.

296
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
Bro, can you do this or not?

297
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:37,960
It’s not me.

298
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,440
I’ve been here for a while.

299
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,400
The car’s here.

300
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,960
But the driver hasn’t shown up.

301
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
I’m hanging up, stop talking nonsense.

302
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,720
Have you seen a man around forty years old?

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,280
A middle-aged man about 1.75 meters tall.

304
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,400
You mean this one?

305
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,960
I happened to see someone at that time.

306
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,520
He was sneaking off in that direction.

307
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,120
Over there?

308
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,120
I'll take you to have a look.

309
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,520
Okay, thank you.

310
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
Let's go. Where else could he have run?

311
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
Alright, stop messing around.

312
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,680
You'll get hurt if you keep this up.

313
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,920
Ouch.

314
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Your teaching quality is just average.

315
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,600
Go ahead.

316
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,680
That day, I saw Chen Zhengwei looking to settle a score with Wang Ziyan.

317
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,200
So I secretly followed them.

318
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,480
I also saw them carry Wang Ziyan into a car.

319
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
They left the city.

320
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,240
You followed them to Hongxing Village?

321
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes.

322
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,520
I saw Wang Ziyan go into a house.

323
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
But after a short while,

324
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
a man came out from inside.

325
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,120
See if it's him.

326
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,840
No, it's not.

327
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Just a reminder,

328
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,600
his name is Yang Dong.

329
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,720
The house that was burned down belonged to him.

330
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,400
Are you sure

331
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,200
he wasn't the one who set the fire?

332
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,240
No, he wasn't.

333
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,560
Could you really see clearly in the dark?

334
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,080
How can you be so sure?

335
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,000
That person

336
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,640
That person was thin

337
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
and looked nothing like the person in the photo.

338
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,280
What about him?

339
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,200
Not really.

340
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,800
No rush.

341
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,160
Take a closer look.

342
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
We can draw it.

343
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,880
Thin and a bit hunched.

344
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,480
Actually, the appearance—

345
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,080
I didn't see it clearly.

346
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,520
The fire was so big at the time.

347
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,000
There must have been some light on his face, right?

348
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,920
I only saw a side profile then.

349
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,720
And I was too nervous.

350
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,320
I really didn't notice.

351
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,040
I think he looked pretty fierce.
