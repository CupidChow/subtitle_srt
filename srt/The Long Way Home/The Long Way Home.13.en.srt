1
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Accompanied by the sound of drizzling rain

2
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,960
let love grow warmer in the rain

3
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,520
Wu Cong from Taining University

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
has requested a song for Yao Lan, whom he has secretly liked for a long time

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,120
a song full of affection

6
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,480
Please listen now

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,360
Lanlan

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,320
Lanlan, don't be impulsive

9
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
There's definitely something wrong with this person

10
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,760
His money might not be

11
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,960
What's wrong with having money

12
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
I just like him, so what

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,240
Think about it carefully

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,160
How many years have you two been broken up

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,640
He disappeared just like that

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
-He says get back together, and you do  -Stop talking

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,920
Do you really know Liu Kui

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,640
What if he was lying to you back then

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
I told you to stop talking

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,800
Lanlan

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
He's back

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,240
Lanlan, you

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,360
A Kui

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,480
Yao Lan

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,560
Yao Lan

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
Yao Lan

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Yao Lan

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,000
It's you

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,040
Say it

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,280
Me

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,400
In what way am I not good enough for you?

32
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,920
Huh?

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
What's so great about that old man?

34
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
Isn't it just because he's rich?

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,320
Right?

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,320
Come on

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you crazy?

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,320
I can earn money too

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,040
Come on

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,040
Is it enough?

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it enough?

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,960
Come on

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,320
Is it enough?

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,320
Is it enough?

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,280
-Is it enough?  -What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,760
Is it enough?

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,720
Wu Cong, you're crazy

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
Are you out of your mind?

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Get out

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,280
What are you doing?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't pull me

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
Don't touch me

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,160
Don't touch me

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,720
Let go, let go

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,400
It's okay now

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,640
It's okay now

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,080
He's just a self-absorbed bookworm

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,560
Who does he think he is?

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,160
He got drunk and came to bother Yao Lan

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,840
I just knocked him out

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Why kill Yao Lan?

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,080
Because Yao Lan is leaving.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,000
I really miss A Kui.

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,400
Calm down.

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,920
Look at me.

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Liu Kui is already gone.

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,600
He won't come back.

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,240
Calm down.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,680
Look at me.

70
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,960
Isn't it good that I'm here with you?

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
A Kui really left.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
A Kui really doesn't want me anymore.

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,680
But I'm here.

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
Isn't it good that I'm here with you?

75
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Liu Kui is gone.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
I've always been here.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,440
Leave me alone.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
-I have to go find him.  -Yao Lan, calm down.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,360
Look at me.

80
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,840
I have to go find him.

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,640
Yao Lan.

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
Are you really leaving?

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
What if I don't leave?

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Face this kind of lunatic every day?

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,520
Okay.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,080
I understand.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm going to find him.

88
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
I watched her.

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,040
She finished that glass of water.

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Then she forced it on Wu Cong.

91
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
For her,

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
Wu Cong could die.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
My brother could die too.

94
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
But what about her?

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
For someone whose background is unknown.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
Besides,

97
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,680
I'm not trying to kill her.

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,080
I want to die with her.

99
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
It hurts, doesn't it?

100
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
Lan Lan, don't be afraid.

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
It'll be ready soon.

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
It's okay.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
I'll stay with you.

104
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,440
Where's Akui?

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,480
Has Akui come back?

106
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Where's Akui?

107
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,440
Akui.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Akui.

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,120
You're still thinking about him, aren't you?

110
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Yao Lan.

111
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,000
Have you ever thought about me?

112
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
Has Akui come back?

113
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,680
Have you ever thought about me?

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,440
Has Akui come back?

115
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,640
It was her.

116
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,920
She was the one who wronged me.

117
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,640
She was also the one who made mistakes.

118
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,280
If she was good to me,

119
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
she should have always been good to me.

120
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
If she couldn't do that, she shouldn't have promised.

121
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
She shouldn't have gotten close to me.

122
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,440
She shouldn't have made me trust her, believe in her.

123
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Didn't you say you wanted to die with Yao Lan?

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
But you only took one sip from that bottle of water, right?

125
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
You got scared.

126
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,280
You chickened out.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,480
Ning Ruirui.

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
You're just a coward.

129
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
You're not worthy of being Yao Lan's friend at all.

130
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,800
I just don't get it.

131
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,160
You two were so close.

132
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Did you ever think about what she was feeling before she died?

133
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
What was on her mind?

134
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,160
What do you know?

135
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
If it weren't for you messing things up,

136
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,120
I would be with her now.

137
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,000
Ning Ruirui.

138
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,720
When Liu Kui was staying at your place,

139
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
did you ever hear him say anything?

140
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,760
No.

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
He just played guitar alone in his room.

142
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,960
He never left the room.

143
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
He didn't talk to me either.

144
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,640
Playing guitar.

145
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,440
So Liu Kui really does have a problem, right?

146
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
I wasn't wrong.

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,040
Liu Kui really does have a problem.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,680
Lanlan should have believed me.

149
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,240
I've always been protecting you.

150
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,200
Why won't you ever believe me?

151
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,080
Liu Kui really does have a problem.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
I knew he had a problem.

153
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,000
Liu Kui really does have a problem.

154
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,720
So I've always been protecting her.

155
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,080
Hello

156
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,080
Mom

157
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm back

158
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,280
Yeah

159
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,480
Just got off the plane

160
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,280
What are you and your brother busy with?

161
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,560
You didn't even call me

162
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,880
But I'm back now, aren't I?

163
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll come see you soon

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
Our whole family

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,720
should get together

166
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,120
Mom

167
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,800
I missed you

168
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay

169
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,440
Daquan

170
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,240
Go straight to the dock

171
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,440
According to Wu Cong's statement

172
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,000
He sold anesthetics to the same buyer three times

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,240
The three transaction locations

174
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:09,960
were

175
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,000
Baima Town

176
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,720
Qinglong Township and Luo County

177
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
These three towns are in different directions of Taining City

178
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,400
Right

179
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,720
So I pulled up

180
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,200
the surveillance footage from the three transaction sites

181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,280
to see if the same person appeared after Wu Cong left

182
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,880
As a result

183
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
I found him

184
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,400
That's something

185
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,080
Qichu

186
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah

187
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
Can you draw from something this blurry?

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,760
I think I can

189
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll give it a try

190
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Draw it

191
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm thinking

192
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
If this buyer is already connected to the trafficking gang

193
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,560
could he also be linked to Liu Kui?

194
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,360
Brother Lai

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Brother Quan

196
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,000
A new batch of goods just arrived.

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,560
The quality is pretty good.

198
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,840
Come here, Xiao Tao, Xiao Shi.

199
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Open the lid.

200
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,160
Look at that.

201
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
Looks nice.

202
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,120
Liu Kui plays the guitar.

203
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
What are you mumbling about by yourself?

204
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,600
Do you remember when we interrogated Ning Ruirui?

205
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,080
What was the last thing she said?

206
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,120
He was just playing guitar alone in the room.

207
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,400
A fugitive suspect

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,880
How could he have the leisure for that?

209
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
But we didn't see a guitar at Yao Lan's house.

210
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,000
And it's just an ordinary guitar.

211
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,640
Why not just leave it at home?

212
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,480
He couldn't have run off carrying something that big.

213
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,840
So where did the guitar go?

214
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,400
Before you went to Yao Lan's house that day,

215
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,120
didn't you almost catch Liu Kui?

216
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,960
Yeah.

217
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,520
What's the name of the street nearby?

218
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,680
Jiulong Alley.

219
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
There's a music store over there.

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,000
Let's go.

221
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,680
How is it?

222
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
I've checked the surveillance footage.

223
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,760
This is the one Liu Kui consigned.

224
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Flashlight.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,040
There seems to be something inside.

226
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,880
It's hard to get out.

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:14:59,960
Come on, come on.

228
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,880
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me.
