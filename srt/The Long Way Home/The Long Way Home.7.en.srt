1
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,960
Dad, hurry up.

2
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,240
We're going to be late.

3
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,880
Quick, quick, quick! We're late!

4
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,360
Master.

5
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,960
Coming.

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,800
Sister.

7
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,880
Um...

8
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,560
The performance is at 3:30.

9
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,120
It's in the auditorium on the first floor of the Children's Palace.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,600
Don't forget.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,960
Okay.

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,640
There's water in the bag.

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,520
Dad's leaving.

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,840
Dad, your hairstyle looks terrible.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,960
Dad really doesn't have time.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,040
Come, let Sister Chuchu fix your hair, okay?

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,520
I was talking about your hair.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,360
Mine? Okay.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,200
Are you done?

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,320
Okay.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,280
Then Dad's leaving.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Sweetie, do your best in the performance.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,640
When you come back, Dad will be your audience.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,200
Can I watch it again, okay?

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm leaving.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,120
Li Dajun has shown up.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,720
I don't have time.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Don't worry.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,160
Take care of yourself.

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,680
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,600
Say bye to Dad.

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm leaving.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,720
Bye-bye, Dad.

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
Bye-bye.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,880
How's your song practice going?

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Sing it for me.

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,400
Where's the ticket?

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
Alright.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Hey

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,480
You didn't buy her another popsicle, did you?

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
Of course I did.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
If I don't, how will she do her homework?

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Qiqi

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,440
Qiqi

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,720
Qiqi

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,480
Qiqi

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
What is it?

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,360
It's time to take Wu Shouwei to identify the scene.

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,200
Let's go.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
He was right there as soon as he came in.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I hit him to death right away.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,800
Then I realized I hit the wrong person.

54
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
So I grabbed a can of gasoline.

55
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,480
I poured it all over.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Set it on fire right there.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,080
That's it.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,880
How long have you been following Yang Dong?

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,960
Over a month.

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,760
Who did he meet before he went there?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,040
Where did he go?

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Wu Shouwei.

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,840
You'd better tell us everything you know.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
Try to make up for it.

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
The court will reconsider your sentence.

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,840
Will it help if I tell you?

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,520
After all these years.

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,280
Let me ask you again.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,840
How much do you know about Yang Dong?

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
Does he have a gang behind him?

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,120
I don't know.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,760
Wu Shouwei.

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
You're not the only one who lost a child.

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
There are so many children still waiting to be saved.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
You know but you won't say.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,080
Do you have a conscience?

77
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,880
A conscience?

78
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,840
Can a conscience bring my son back?

79
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I could have anything.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,680
But you can't bring him back.

81
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't care if others live or die.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,720
No matter how many die.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,600
When they die has nothing to do with me.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,880
It has nothing to do with you?

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,520
Calm down.

86
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
It has nothing to do with you?

87
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,040
Calm down.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,960
Let go of me.

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,680
Zhao Zhi.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
Don't touch me.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,280
What's wrong with him today?

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,760
He's been acting strange since this morning.

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
I think you're acting strange too.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
Do you know how long we've been looking for this group?

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Do you know how much time we've spent?

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,640
How long?

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Five years.

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,760
In 2006,

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,120
we finally learned Liu Kui's name.

100
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
In 2007,

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,320
we found out about his overseas businesses.

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,440
It wasn't until last year

103
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,200
that we found his contact in the country.

104
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,560
You said you joined the task force to be a hero.

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,520
I suggest you be mentally prepared.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,640
Here,

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,640
your dreams won't come true that easily.

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,960
I'll take Wu Shouwei.

109
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,760
Zhao Zhi.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
Just take him straight to the detention center.

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,800
Look at him.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,840
He won't say anything else.

113
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,280
Let's think about other leads.

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,920
Got it.

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,640
Hanging up.

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm driving.

117
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Let's talk.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,680
Sure, let's chat.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
I've seen someone even more ruthless than you.

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,160
His wife died on the operating table.

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,880
He killed the entire family of the hospital director.

122
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,360
That scene

123
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
was too much for even the police to handle.

124
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
He also had a fourteen-year-old son.

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,320
The boy had just been admitted to the top high school.

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
Did they catch him?

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, they did.

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
They chased him for three months.

129
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,480
He was shot dead.

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
On the very day they caught him,

131
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,760
the police officer who caught him

132
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,480
lost his own daughter.

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,280
Li Dajun has shown up.

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,840
I don't have time.

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
Don't worry.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,320
Take care of yourself.

137
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Okay, okay.

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,680
Say goodbye to Dad.

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm leaving.

140
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,920
Bye, Dad.

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Bye.

142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Have you learned the song?

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,280
Did you buy the ticket?

144
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,600
A police officer who can protect others

145
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
can't protect his own family.

146
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,320
Isn't that ridiculous?

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,080
It is.

148
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Who isn't ridiculous?

149
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,080
Every single person out of a hundred is ridiculous.

150
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,840
Your son Chengcheng must be in his teens by now, right?

151
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Just like Qiqi.

152
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
Have you ever had nightmares?

153
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Nightmares about your child being taken away.

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,080
Was he scared?

155
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Nightmares about you not being by his side.

156
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,280
Was he ever hurt?

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,640
Did he feel pain?

158
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,160
Was he hungry?

159
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,560
Did he cry?

160
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Have you ever thought about it?

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,720
If you had been there that day,

162
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
the child wouldn't have gone missing.

163
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
Have you ever thought about it?

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
Every day we live

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,880
is a day of suffering.

166
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
You must be suffering too, right?

167
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
Even if you kill Yang Dong,

168
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
will you really be free?

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
I don't know much either.

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Bring people.

171
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,400
Wu Shouwei is about to talk.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,480
Interrogation room, hurry!

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,880
Zhao Zhi.

174
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,120
What's wrong?

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,440
It's nothing.

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,240
What is it?

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
It's really nothing.

178
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,760
Hurry up.

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,200
You mean in the early morning of the 6th,

180
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,120
you saw Yang Dong at the old factory next to the distillery?

181
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Yes.

182
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,320
The 6th.

183
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,760
It was the 6th.

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,920
That day, I went there planning to kill him.

185
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
But then,

186
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,760
there was another man inside the room.

187
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,080
Since you were already out,

188
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
why didn’t you come home?

189
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
Mom has been looking for you.

190
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
I have a home now.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,680
Is it him?

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,000
I don’t know.

193
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,760
I was outside, I didn’t go in.

194
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,440
I didn’t see his face.

195
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,360
What did they say?

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
Well,

197
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
the man was looking for Yang Dong,

198
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,080
asking for something.

199
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
He said if you don’t want trouble, hand it over.

200
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,880
If you give it up, there won’t be any trouble.

201
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,560
I’ve always been the one to take the blame for everything since I was a kid.

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,800
No matter what it is, they always think I took it.

203
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
Yang Dong wouldn’t give it to him.

204
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,840
So the two of them started fighting.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,480
What exactly was it?

206
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,600
What exactly was it?

207
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
They didn’t say.

208
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
But I think it must have been something important.

209
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,360
Because the fight between them

210
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
was really intense.

211
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,720
Later, Yang Dong ran out.

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,160
I thought,

213
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,280
so I grabbed a knife and went up.

214
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,040
But then,

215
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,520
a young girl came out.

216
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,040
Girl

217
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,640
How old is she?

218
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
About seven or eight.

219
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,520
Yeah, seven or eight.

220
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,280
When I saw there was a child here,

221
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,560
I thought, never mind, I know where he lives.

222
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
I'll go to his house to look for him.

223
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
You know what happened after that.

224
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
That's all.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,880
Are you sure that's really all you know?

226
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
I want to find Yang Dong even more than you do.

227
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,680
Got it.

228
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,400
What you said,

229
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,480
I'll check it out.

230
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,160
Hey.

231
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,440
Can I ask you something?

232
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,400
Go ahead.

233
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
Have you found your child?

234
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,720
Not yet.

235
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,280
Maybe soon.

236
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,800
Maybe.

237
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,320
Hey.

238
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,080
Let me know if you find them.

239
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,000
Even burning a message for me is fine.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,560
Okay.

241
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you.

242
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,480
Thank you.

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
Ask whatever you want.

244
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Is it Liu Kui?

245
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,600
The person who took Qiqi

246
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
was a little boy.

247
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,200
He looked about ten years old.

248
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,400
He was the one who lured Qiqi away.

249
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,200
That little boy

250
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,960
was later found by the police.

251
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
He was originally a kidnapped child too.

252
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,160
But later, he became an accomplice to the traffickers.

253
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,920
And also,

254
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,120
the person who took Qiqi out that day

255
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,920
was me.

256
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,000
We don't have time to play, let's go.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,560
Let's play hide-and-seek.

258
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,360
We really don't have time to play hide-and-seek, Qiqi.

259
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,440
Qiqi.

260
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,840
We're not playing hide-and-seek anymore, Qiqi.

261
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,320
There's no time, Qiqi.

262
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,080
Sis, I'm here.

263
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,880
Come.

264
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,080
Stop running.

265
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,080
Qiqi.

266
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,600
Qiqi.

267
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,720
Come here.

268
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Qiqi, let's stop playing for now.

269
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,960
We're going to be late today, okay?

270
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
Let's go, let's go.

271
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,760
Hello.

272
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Yes, that's me.

273
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,320
Okay, I understand.

274
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Thank you.

275
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,040
Sister

276
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,480
If

277
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,840
If it happened again

278
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,920
That day

279
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,120
Would Zhao Zhi still go after the killer?

280
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
Yes
