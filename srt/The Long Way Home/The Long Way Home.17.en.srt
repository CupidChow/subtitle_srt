1
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,040
Hurry up, hurry up!

2
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,360
Put some effort into it.

3
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Didn't you eat enough?

4
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
All of you, put some effort into it.

5
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
My stomach hurts.

6
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
My stomach hurts.

7
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
Hurry up, hurry up.

8
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,800
Okay.

9
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

10
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,040
What is this?

11
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,080
Didn't you say you didn't know her?

12
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
What did you do to them?

13
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
You took the gold.

14
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
And you even hit me.

15
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,960
How should we settle this?

16
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
Let them go.

17
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,680
Otherwise, you'll never see the gold.

18
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
Take your filthy hands off.

19
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
Second Brother,

20
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
The five of us brothers,

21
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Big Brother, Little Jiang,

22
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:09,640
Dongzi,

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
are all gone.

24
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
Only the two of us are left.

25
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,440
Can the two of us

26
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,560
still be good brothers?

27
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,200
Let's get the gold back.

28
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,880
Mom will give it to you.

29
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,840
Mom.

30
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
You still can't wean off your mom?

31
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,120
You all act so tough.

32
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,520
But I only have Mom.

33
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,440
Let me tell you,

34
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
where the gold is.

35
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,040
Where is it?

36
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,520
Come here.

37
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,920
I'll go.

38
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,880
Let them go.

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Then you might still get to see the gold.

40
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,440
Little girl

41
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
That mute aunt of yours

42
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
I've already sent her back

43
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
Do you want to go back?

44
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,880
Dad

45
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
He still hasn't said where the gold is

46
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,760
Let's have a talk, just the two of us

47
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
What are your terms?

48
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Mom

49
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,320
How would I know where your mom is?

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
Weren't you picked up from the mine?

51
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,240
Your mom

52
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,120
Do you know why your dad wants to find her?

53
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you understand?

54
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
You made a mistake

55
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,040
What?

56
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,520
Will also be

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
You want to see my mom

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Kid

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,040
When making a wish

60
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,000
Be careful

61
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,280
Luo Haixiao

62
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,360
Hello

63
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,040
Brother Lai

64
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,480
Luo Haixiao stole a car and ran away

65
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,920
Brother Hai ran away

66
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,560
Turn right.

67
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,120
Turn right again.

68
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,160
Turn right.

69
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Stop.

70
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,720
Turn off the lights.

71
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,840
Coming. Who is it?

72
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,280
Open the door.

73
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,360
Coming, coming.

74
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Hurry.

75
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,680
This is killing me.

76
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
What is it now?

77
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,240
Hey.

78
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,000
Old Zhao.

79
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Let me tell you.

80
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,960
You should go to the hospital for a checkup, seriously.

81
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
I think you,

82
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,000
might have hyperthyroidism.

83
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,560
This is...

84
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,320
If you're sick, you need treatment.

85
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,880
Stop bothering me.

86
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,840
Is it still about Tang Cheng?

87
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,160
Back then, there were so many of you.

88
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
Nearly ten years of effort.

89
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,160
It's impossible there are no clues at all.

90
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,560
It's not that we don't have skills, do you?

91
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
Cut the nonsense.

92
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,120
Let me tell you, Qian Laosan.

93
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Now people have died because of these gold bars.

94
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
If you know anything, say it now.

95
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,400
You go first.

96
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm listening.

97
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
What is this trying to say?

98
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
Didn't you say there was a maid at Tang Cheng's house back then?

99
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,960
Take a look.

100
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Does it look familiar?

101
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,720
The maid disappeared.

102
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,600
At that time, Tang Cheng

103
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,120
specifically looked for a photo of that maid,

104
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,160
but couldn't find any.

105
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,280
How would I know where she is?

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,440
His name is Liu Kui.

107
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,920
Xu Honglai.

108
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Yang Dong.

109
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,000
Luo Haixiao.

110
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
These might not be their real names.

111
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,240
But they are likely part of a criminal gang.

112
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Who is he?

113
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,760
You don't know?

114
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,240
I know.

115
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
His name is Huang Jiang.

116
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
Huang Jiang.

117
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,080
That's right.

118
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
Did you see him again after the gold bars were stolen back then?

119
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,520
No.

120
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,280
No, I really haven't.

121
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,640
Not bad, Old Zhao.

122
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
Could it be him?

123
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,120
He's just skin and bones.

124
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,440
How much more do you know about Huang Jiang?

125
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,080
How much could I possibly know?

126
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,720
I've only interacted with him a few times.

127
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
The kid is pretty good.

128
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
He's quite handsome.

129
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,160
He told me

130
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,000
Told you what about him?

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
He and a few of his brothers

132
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
were raised by a woman

133
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,520
by the railway tracks.

134
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Who is that woman?

135
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,840
I don't know.

136
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,840
Never met her.

137
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
Third Brother.

138
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,680
Think carefully.

139
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,840
What for?

140
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
You have a lot of connections.

141
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,120
Go, go, go.

142
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,880
Old Zhao

143
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,840
Look at me

144
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Do I look like

145
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,200
a computer to you?

146
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,680
Huh?

147
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
One moment you ask where this is,

148
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,520
the next you ask where that is.

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,160
Am I in charge of household registration?

150
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
If the neighbor's dog goes missing,

151
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,360
do you have to ask me too?

152
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
You know,

153
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,320
where would I...

154
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,000
I remember now.

155
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,920
She's called Aunt Huang.

156
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,640
Aunt Huang.

157
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,360
Which Aunt?

158
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,880
No, that's not right.

159
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,880
Gui.

160
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,600
Gui as in osmanthus, Aunt Gui.

161
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,520
Aunt Gui.

162
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Alright, I got it.

163
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
If I need anything else, I'll ask you.

164
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,360
Thanks, Old Qian.

165
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,400
No need to thank me, I owe you anyway.

166
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,480
Exactly.

167
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
Aren't you still owing me two hundred?

168
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on, hand it over.

169
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
It's been so many years.

170
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,320
I still haven't given you any news about Qiqi.

171
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I haven't found her for you.

172
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't know this person either.

174
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,680
It seems they've never shown their face.

175
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
She is the

176
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
mother of these five people.

177
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Where was Daiqi on the night of the 5th?

178
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,320
The van.

179
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
Wasn't she sick that day?

180
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
Then take this.

181
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,720
The van.

182
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,160
Where's Daiqi, Auntie?

183
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,920
She

184
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
isn't here.

185
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,360
Take the kids home first.

186
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,160
-Qianqian  -Mumu

187
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,360
Mom will be back soon.

188
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,160
Say goodbye to your mom.

189
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,720
Be good.

190
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,360
Bye-bye.

191
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,080
-Let's go, let's go  -Goodbye

192
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,840
Master.

193
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,320
Hmm.

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,880
You do it.

195
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,200
It's finished.

196
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,880
She

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,640
This

198
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,040
This is

199
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,360
the nanny at Daiqi's house.

200
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,880
Who is it? The child is sleeping.

201
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,440
Police.

202
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Is Zhang Guiping here?

203
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,200
Please cooperate.

204
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,080
Stop.

205
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,160
Who are you?

206
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
You just barged in.

207
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,600
Who let you in?

208
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,480
Aunt Zhang isn't here.

209
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,320
She quit yesterday.

210
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,680
Where did she go?

211
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,480
Do you have her phone number?

212
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,600
I don't know, I don't have her number.

213
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
Then you must have the agency's number.

214
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
We now suspect Zhang Guiping.

215
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,240
What else can you suspect?

216
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,040
My daughter and son-in-law have already been taken by you.

217
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,920
Now you're saying our nanny has a problem.

218
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you done yet?

219
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,680
Is your child okay?

220
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,960
I already told you.

221
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,400
He's sleeping.

222
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,840
Go, go, go.

223
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,480
Knocking on the door in the middle of the night.

224
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,240
Do you have any manners?

225
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,400
Mom

226
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,080
The police are watching us now.

227
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,520
And also Brother Hai's side.

228
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,440
Taining is very unsafe right now.

229
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,920
You're worried.

230
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,840
Yes.

231
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,080
You should leave the country the day after tomorrow.

232
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,280
Go to Man Ni Island first.

233
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Wait until I get the gold.

234
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,040
Then I'll bring you back to Wusu.

235
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,800
Little Fa Lao is also waiting for us to return.

236
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,360
You make the decisions this time.

237
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,160
I won't interfere.

238
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,960
Don't worry.

239
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,640
I've arranged everything.

240
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
I've also sorted out your exit route.

241
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,360
This group of children

242
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,200
will all be sent away the day after tomorrow as well.

243
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,240
Add one more.

244
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Add one.

245
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,200
Mumu

246
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,760
I want Daiqi's son too.

247
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,880
Okay.

248
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,240
Understood.

249
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll find another good kid to be his friend.
