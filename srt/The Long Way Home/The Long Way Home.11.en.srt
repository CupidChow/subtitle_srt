1
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
In a bit, I’ll, um...

2
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,680
I’m getting an award tonight.

3
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,520
So how do I keep you from...

4
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,200
Hey, Yao Lan.

5
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Senior.

6
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,720
Hey.

7
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,400
My dish won an award.

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,920
No, no.

9
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,960
Tonight, I’ll treat you to a “thesis” dinner.

10
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,880
No, no, I...

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,480
Sorry, Senior.

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,440
I’ve been really busy lately.

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,480
Wait, hold on.

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,280
Here, hold this for me.

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,520
And this too.

16
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
Um...

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,680
I noticed this brand is pretty popular lately.

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,080
I bought it for you.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,640
That’s not necessary.

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
They have plenty at home.

21
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,160
Master

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,120
Look at this

23
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,600
The lab has a bottle of 25 grams of potassium cyanide

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,960
And a bottle of 25 grams of sodium cyanide

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,040
That's a lot

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Wu Cong has signed out and used them five times in the past three months

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Altogether

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,720
It's about three grams

30
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Do you remember the lethal dose of cyanide?

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
0.02 grams

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
He used way too much

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
Congcong has changed because of that girl.

34
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,880
He's become a completely different person.

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,680
Are you saying

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,720
Wu Cong and Yao Lan are dating?

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
Where did this come from?

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,920
Did you touch my things?

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,960
Money.

40
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,320
Where did it come from?

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm asking you a question.

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,320
I earned it.

43
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,880
Ten thousand yuan.

44
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
You're a student, where did you earn that?

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,240
If it was earned honestly,

46
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
would you have hidden it from me?

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
Say something.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
Stop bothering me.

49
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,720
Say something!

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Stop bothering me!

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,520
Come back!

52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
What is it?

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Did Yao Lan ask you to buy it?

54
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,840
It has nothing to do with her.

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,800
It has nothing to do with you.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
Give it here.

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
If you did something wrong for that kind of woman,

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
if you did something you shouldn't have,

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,320
you're destroying this family.

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,400
What kind of woman?

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
What kind of woman is Yao Lan?

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
Yao Lan is my girlfriend.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
Please don't talk about her like that.

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm your mother.

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,520
Why can't I say what I want?

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
She's nothing but trouble.

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,760
You're my mother.

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Yao Lan.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,920
She's my girlfriend.

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
She's my girlfriend.

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm a troublemaker too.

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,640
Beat me to death.

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
You—

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,480
What are you doing?

75
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,040
I—

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,400
Wu Cong, what are you doing?

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,680
I—

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,120
Beat me to death.

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
What are you doing, Wu Cong?

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,760
Beat me to death.

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,280
What are you doing?

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
Beat me to death.

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,200
What are you doing?

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't want to live anymore, okay?

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,480
What are you doing?

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,320
I don't want to live anymore.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Kids, you know.

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
They're all like that.

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,880
The more you oppose them,

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,160
the more they insist.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,720
I'm the one who pushed him toward Yao Lan.

92
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,840
If I had just gone along with him,

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,560
he definitely wouldn't have gone to Yao Lan.

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Maybe nothing would have happened.

95
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,480
It's all my fault.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
I was wrong.

97
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Why do you have the school's chemicals?

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
Wu Cong stole toxic chemicals from the school.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,160
That's already against the law.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,280
This is your only chance to save your son.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,280
Tell me—

102
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,200
What did Wu Cong take?

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,600
It's succinylcholine.

104
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
An anesthetic.

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,440
To be precise,

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,960
it's a muscle relaxant.

107
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,400
It's not cyanide.

108
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,320
Cyanide.

109
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,960
Cyanide can kill people.

110
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
I wouldn't dare.

111
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,560
Then why did you have it?

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,840
Someone contacted me online and said

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
if I sold him one gram,

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,120
he'd give me a thousand yuan.

115
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,560
But I already had my mom put it all back.

116
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,760
I was just afraid you'd find out.

117
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,320
I swear I didn't poison anyone.

118
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,240
I swear.

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,520
I just wanted to make more money.

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
And make Yao Lan like me, that's all.

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
I did all this,

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
really, it was all for Yao Lan.

123
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920
I...

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,920
If it weren't for Yao Lan,

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,520
I would never have broken the law.

126
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
No one forced you to break the law.

127
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,880
How can you blame Yao Lan for your own mistakes?

128
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,840
Do you know your mom broke the law to cover for you?

129
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
She risked breaking the law.

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
Did she ever blame you?

131
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,280
No.

132
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,560
I...

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,680
This is Wu Cong's account.

134
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
These conversations are probably all coded language for transactions.

135
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Can you find the location of the person he's chatting with?

136
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
The IP address is overseas.

137
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,080
It must be encrypted.

138
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
It will take some time to crack it.

139
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,520
Okay.

140
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,240
Let me know if you have any updates.

141
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Understood.

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,320
I suspect the buyer behind this is involved in human trafficking.

143
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,280
How's it going on your end?

144
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,040
The notes from the neighborhood committee lady read like a novel.

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I've organized everything.

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,640
Take a look.

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,240
Yao Lan.

148
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,160
Lively and adorable personality.

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,480
Polite to elders.

150
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Parents are locals.

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,000
Retired employees from a state-owned enterprise.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
No debts.

153
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,400
What's interesting is this one.

154
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,160
Ning Ruirui.

155
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,320
Shy and reserved personality.

156
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Her mother remarried when she was three.

157
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
Later, she had a younger brother.

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,360
The brother is twenty this year.

159
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,720
He often comes to her for money.

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,320
Shows up at her place.

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,440
Constant arguments.

162
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
The impact is very negative.

163
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,440
What's her brother's name?

164
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,960
Guo Long.

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,480
Authentic Xinjiang lamb kidneys.

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,360
I need to pee.

167
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,800
Bump for me.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,240
Business is booming, boss.

169
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,840
His name is Guo Long.

170
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Him?

171
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,440
He has a bunch of creditors.

172
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,560
He's a regular at the police station.

173
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
He never commits big crimes, but he's always causing minor trouble.

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
Just look at his shop.

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
There's a fight there every other day.

176
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
Those are all regulars.

177
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
Why isn't he here?

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
Normally,

179
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
he should be here during the day.

180
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
Do you know where he lives?

181
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,680
You guys—

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,120
Who are you looking for?

183
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,800
Police.

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Do you know Guo Long?

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,160
Yes.

186
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,920
He's my friend.

187
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,920
Where does he live?

188
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,280
He lives at my place.

189
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm his landlord.

190
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,040
Is it convenient?

191
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Guo Long.

192
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Police.

193
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,200
Open the door.

194
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
Guo Long.

195
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,800
We're the police.

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,520
Come out and answer a few questions for us.

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,200
Guo Long.

198
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,480
Guo Long.

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,520
Where is he?

200
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't know either.

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,760
Don't run!

202
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,960
Stop, Guo Long!

203
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,840
Stop!

204
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
Guo Long, stop!

205
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,360
Don't run, stop!

206
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,520
Guo Long!

207
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,720
Don't run, stop!

208
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Chase him!

209
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Don't move.

210
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
Officer, what do you mean by this?

211
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,400
You need to give me a reason for bringing me here.

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,560
Why did you run?

213
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,240
Who would dare run, officer?

214
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,720
I was just exercising.

215
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,160
Exercising?

216
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,840
Be serious.

217
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
What's your relationship with Ning Ruirui?

218
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,520
Ning Ruirui and I have the same mother.

219
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
But we're not close.

220
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,200
Not close?

221
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,080
If you're not close, how could you shamelessly ask her for money?

222
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,800
Who says it's shameless to ask for money?

223
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,520
It's only natural for an older sister to support her younger brother.

224
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
That's her duty.

225
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
Say "her duty" one more time.

226
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,240
The police are going to hit me! Hit me!

227
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
Guo Long.

228
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Ning Ruirui is currently unconscious from poisoning.

229
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
You are her family member.

230
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
You are obligated to cooperate with the police investigation.

231
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,960
Poisoned?

232
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,320
Did anyone die?

233
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,720
Is there any compensation?

234
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Can you speak like a normal person?

235
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,440
There’s no compensation.

236
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
You can’t unlock these handcuffs.

237
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,760
If you don’t give me money,

238
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I’m not leaving.

239
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,640
Let me tell you,

240
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,120
Think carefully while you’re here.

241
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
Still asking for money?

242
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,000
Do you think you can get out?

243
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320
What do you mean, “think carefully here”?

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,280
You’re the ones who should think carefully.

245
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,120
What kind of person is this?

246
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
Shameless and still so stubborn.

247
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,240
If this were my brother,

248
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,280
I’d be looking for you right now.

249
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
What’s wrong?

250
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,800
There is indeed succinylcholine in Yao Lan’s body.

251
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,160
But its purity is much lower than what Wu Cong’s lab produces.

252
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,520
I suspect

253
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
the source of this drug might

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,920
not be Wu Cong.

255
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,360
Not Wu Cong?

256
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,960
Then it’s Liu Kui.

257
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,120
Human traffickers

258
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
definitely have anesthetics like this.

259
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,560
Not necessarily.

260
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
It must be from the traffickers, right?

261
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
What about dog traders?

262
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,840
This guy isn’t telling the truth.

263
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,520
Old Li,

264
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,800
bring your colleagues from the drug administration and come with me.

265
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes, right now.

266
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,400
We’re going to a barbecue restaurant.

267
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,680
Check their ingredients.

268
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,360
Okay.

269
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,560
What are you doing?

270
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,280
Keep an eye on him for me.

271
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,800
Go back.

272
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,360
Officer

273
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Come back

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,720
I really don't know

275
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Don't shout

276
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,800
Ning Ruirui

277
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,560
Ning Ruirui

278
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,400
We are the police

279
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,520
You're safe now

280
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
We have a few questions

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,880
Where is Yao Lan?

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Where is Yao Lan?

283
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,400
Yao Lan

284
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,800
is no longer here

285
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Ning Ruirui

286
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
Have you seen him?

287
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,440
He's Lanlan's boyfriend

288
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,960
How long did he stay at your place?

289
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,120
Which time?

290
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,920
Which time?

291
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,160
How long did he stay this time?

292
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
About two or three weeks

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Or maybe a month

294
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,400
I don't remember

295
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,800
When he was at home

296
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,320
Did you hear them say anything?

297
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,680
No

298
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
Like names

299
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,280
Times

300
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,160
Places

301
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,840
Don't worry

302
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,800
Come.

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,560
Look at the photos.

304
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,600
Take a look.

305
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,000
Think about it more carefully.

306
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
Focus on the details.

307
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
- For example, names. - I don't know.

308
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
Time and place.

309
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,000
Think again.

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Liu Kui left this time.

311
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,360
Do you know where he went?

312
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,920
Think carefully.

313
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,760
Don't be nervous.

314
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,560
Just think about it, I'm only asking.

315
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,720
The patient needs to rest now.

316
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,240
I'm not finished asking.

317
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,880
Please leave for now.

318
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,760
Please leave immediately.

319
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,680
Ning Ruirui.

320
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,080
Ning Ruirui, think carefully.

321
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,400
He stayed at home for so long.

322
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,640
It's impossible you didn't hear anything.

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,280
We live in a society governed by law now.

324
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
And yet you keep me locked up here for hours.

325
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,800
Does this look familiar?

326
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Sit properly.

327
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,040
Where did you find this?

328
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,240
What is it used for?

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
Don’t you already know?

330
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,480
Why are you still asking me?

331
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,960
I’m asking you right now.

332
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,080
Speak.

333
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
To poison dogs.

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
To poison dogs, that’s it.

335
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
And then?

336
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,400
It’s not easy to run a lamb restaurant these days.

337
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,840
The cost of lamb is too high.

338
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,520
I have to mix in some dog meat to sell.

339
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,720
To save money, you know?

340
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,920
With technology so advanced now,

341
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
Let me tell you about this stuff.

342
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,080
Boil it in hot water,

343
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,640
and people won’t have any problems eating it.

344
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
—I’m not the only one doing this.  —Who did you buy it from?

345
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,080
It must have been sold by a dog dealer.

346
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Name, address—write it down.

347
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,120
My head’s spinning right now.

348
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,280
I really can’t remember.

349
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,640
Guo Long, listen carefully.

350
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,680
Your poison is connected to a poisoning case.

351
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,720
You’re involved in a homicide now.

352
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,400
If you still refuse to cooperate,

353
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,240
do you know what the consequences will be?

354
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,680
Huh?

355
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,920
Write.

356
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,520
What does he look like?

357
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,320
Describe him.

358
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,920
What does he look like?

359
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,040
Looks like a man.

360
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,160
A man.

361
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
Middle-aged.

362
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,640
About 1.65 meters tall.

363
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
On his face.

364
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,240
Pockmarks.

365
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,800
A lot of people have pockmarks.

366
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Well, he has them too.

367
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
I really can't remember.

368
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,160
I really can't recall clearly.

369
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,160
Where do you usually make the deals?

370
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Usually on the street.

371
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,440
On the street.

372
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,320
Why don't you just say you deal at the police station?

373
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,000
We really do deal on the street, officer.

374
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
Really on the street.

375
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
Which street?

376
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
I can't read the street name.

377
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
Not being honest, are you?

378
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,640
I'm really telling the truth now.

379
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm being honest.

380
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,920
I called him.

381
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
He might not answer.

382
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,960
She just woke up, her mind is still confused.

383
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,080
Let's wait a bit more.

384
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,800
Wait for what?

385
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,320
Can we still afford to wait?

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Have we caught anyone yet?

387
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't arrest me.

388
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Go arrest someone else.

389
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
Sorry, Master.

390
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,400
Don't apologize to me.

391
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
Go apologize to Yao Lan.

392
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,520
And apologize to those kids who can't come back.

393
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,840
Hello?

394
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,160
Okay.

395
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
I know who the killer is.
