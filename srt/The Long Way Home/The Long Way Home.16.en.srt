1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Are we lost?

2
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,920
Where is this place?

3
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,640
Go.

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,040
Once we cross this mountain,

5
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,640
we'll reach Wusu.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,440
Trust me.

7
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Let's go.

8
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,720
What's wrong?

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
You are all my children.

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,960
What children are thinking in their hearts,

11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,680
would a mother not know?

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,800
Tell me.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
Why are you leaving me?

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Is it because of that mute Su Yun?

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Mom.

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,280
This has nothing to do with Xiao Jiang.

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,800
It was my decision.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,040
It was all my idea.

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,760
Since you want to leave,

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
then go ahead.

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,960
I'll watch you leave.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
A Kui.

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,720
Xiao Jiang.

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Xiao Jiang.

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,960
A Kui.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
And Xiao Hai.

27
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,520
is dead.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,480
The old man took a sedative before going to bed.

29
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,840
About what happened last night,

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,760
he doesn't remember anything.

31
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,360
It was just fifteen minutes short.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Liu Kui's third and fourth cervical vertebrae were broken.

33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
He was strangled with an oxygen tube.

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Zhao Zhi.

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
We found a handgun under the cabinet.

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
And two bullets.

37
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,880
The fingerprints match Liu Kui.

38
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,800
We didn't hear any gunshots last night.

39
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,000
So the killer must have been hiding in the room in advance.

40
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,200
Gu Da.

41
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
There's also a footprint at the door.

42
00:03:59,480 --> 00:03:59,920
Let's go.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,120
Gu Da.

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,400
It's this one.

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
This footprint has been compared.

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
It appeared before as well.

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,160
At the scene of Yang Dong's death.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you saying this person killed Yang Dong first,

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,480
and now came to kill Liu Kui?

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,560
Then what about Granny Qin?

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
What's her relationship with him?

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,760
Master.

53
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,920
Birthmark.

54
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
Zhao Zhi, I know now.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,760
They are mother and son.

56
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,360
Yes, they are

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,920
mother and son.

58
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
Aunt Qin has been living here for almost ten years.

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,760
She was like this when she arrived.

60
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Her mental state hasn't been normal.

61
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,480
She waits for her son at the door every day.

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
I heard he's been missing for over twenty years.

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,760
Missing.

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Over twenty years.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Liu Kui.

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
Turns out he was also a missing child.

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,280
Did any strangers come here last night?

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
Visitors, volunteers?

69
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
There are visitors every day.

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
This is the visitor log.

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,400
Think carefully again.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,840
Was there anything unusual last night?

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Unusual?

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Oh, right.

75
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,080
Before lights out,

76
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,160
when I was making my rounds,

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
I saw a volunteer still washing dishes in the kitchen.

78
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,960
But usually, volunteers don't stay that late.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
Did you get a good look at him?

80
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,280
His head seemed quite round and big.

81
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
As for his face shape,

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,360
Long face.

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
No, that's not right.

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,240
Square face.

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,160
His jaw was a bit wide.

86
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
He was quite tall.

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
His hair was a bit long.

88
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
But it seemed to come down to about here.

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,360
Long hair.

90
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:08,880
Yes, long hair.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,560
Tall.

92
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Is it him?

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,760
Yes.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,280
He’s the one I saw last night.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,000
He really does look familiar.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,080
And that man, a few months ago,

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,760
also got a new ID card from him.

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,840
This is it.

99
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Luo Haixiao.

100
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
Have Xiao Zhou do a footprint analysis.

101
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,720
Check if the body shape matches Luo Haixiao.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Understood.

103
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
Please take good care of Aunt Qin.

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,520
This money is for her to buy nutritional supplements.

105
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
This...

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
Based on Teacher Qi's sketch

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,920
we can now confirm

108
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
that the person who bought anesthetics from Wu Cong

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,800
is him

110
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,120
Xu Honglai

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
nicknamed A-Lai

112
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,520
he is twenty-nine years old

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
holds a Wusu passport

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
and works in the seafood trade

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,200
Zhao Zhi

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,080
I have another discovery

117
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Do you remember Meiligong?

118
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,400
The place where Liu Kui imprisoned abducted women

119
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,240
When we went to make the arrest

120
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,760
he interfered at Meiligong

121
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,800
Alright

122
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,040
No need to say the rest

123
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,880
This Xu Honglai

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,640
is one of Meiligong's shareholders

125
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,760
Now it all connects

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,960
What we can confirm now is

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Liu Kui

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Yang Dong, and Xu Honglai

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
they belong to a human trafficking organization

130
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,240
So the twelve missing children

131
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
are very likely

132
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
to be in the hands of this gang

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,520
What about him?

134
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,800
What is his relationship with the others?

135
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
The purpose of these three people is very clear.

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
They're all involved in human trafficking.

137
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,480
But I haven't found any connection with Luo Haixiao.

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,200
What does he have to do with human trafficking?

139
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,640
He seems more like

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,680
someone who kills just for the sake of killing.

141
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,280
A hitman.

142
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,680
Someone paid him.

143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,280
To clean up the organization.

144
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,960
A hitman's methods would be more efficient.

145
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,720
But he's not.

146
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,760
Then it's a vendetta.

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Did he also lose a child?

148
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
Do Liu Kui and Yang Dong both

149
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,160
have this same mark on them?

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,520
Yeah.

151
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,960
Why would Luo Haixiao kill people with this mark?

152
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,200
So our next goal

153
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
is to figure out

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
Luo Haixiao's motive for killing.

155
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Su Yun.

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Are you okay?

157
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Everything's gone.

158
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,640
Can't melt it down anymore.

159
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,440
Hey.

160
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,760
Next door.

161
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
There's a shoe seller next door named Old Sun.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,920
Go find him.

163
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,320
But you have to tell him a code word.

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,720
Tell him

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
"Do you have size forty-two,

166
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,800
a pair of little red shoes,

167
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,680
with double air cushions?"

168
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
Do you understand?

169
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Kid, do you like this pair?

170
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,440
I want the red ones with double air cushions.

171
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,800
Who sent you?

172
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,720
Old Pei.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah.

174
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Wang He

175
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,400
Follow

176
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,600
Alright

177
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,440
Here, bro

178
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
The thing you wanted has appeared

179
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,640
I want to find my dad

180
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,880
I know

181
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,840
How much

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Thirty gold bars

183
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
Three million

184
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
The three million from back then until now

185
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,600
Has probably tripled by now, if not more

186
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh

187
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,760
Two petty thieves

188
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,520
Knocked out the nanny in an instant

189
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
Then took a couple hostage

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,840
Do you believe that

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,800
Do you believe that

192
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,320
I don't believe it anyway

193
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Who does he think he is

194
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,280
He is

195
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,960
He is Qian Laosan

196
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,400
A key target in the anti-crime campaign ten years ago

197
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,240
So what

198
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
It means that ten years ago, when he was in the game

199
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,840
You were still failing your exams

200
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,440
Isn't he just a cook now too?

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,160
And his cooking isn't even as good as mine.

202
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
Qian Laosan said the robber's mark is on the collarbone.

203
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,600
It doesn't match either Yang Dong or Liu Kui.

204
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
Doesn't that mean the two of them aren't the robbers?

205
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Even if that night,

206
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
the people Tang Cheng ran into weren't those two,

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,040
it doesn't mean they aren't accomplices.

208
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,120
Do you remember

209
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,520
Liu Kui kept asking Yang Dong for something

210
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,640
important?

211
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,720
You mean

212
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,160
that thing

213
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
was the gold bar?

214
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,240
Hey,

215
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,240
is it possible that

216
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,000
after Tang Cheng's gold bar was stolen,

217
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,480
they went to Yang Dong to fence it,

218
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,760
then Tang Cheng set up a huge manhunt,

219
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,520
so Yang Dong hid the gold bar first.

220
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,760
A few months later,

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
Yang Dong was arrested for intentional assault.

222
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,360
The gold bar's whereabouts became unknown.

223
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,800
So

224
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,720
his accomplices

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,520
had no choice but to wait until Yang Dong got out of prison

226
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,680
to split the loot.

227
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
So Liu Kui, Luo Haixiao,

228
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,360
and even that guy Alai,

229
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,640
were all after that huge sum of money.

230
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,640
Since Luo Haixiao already killed Yang Dong,

231
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
that means he got the gold bar.

232
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
Why would he still kill Liu Kui?

233
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,400
What's his goal?

234
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,040
Will he keep killing?

235
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
Yeah.

236
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Hello

237
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,880
Mom

238
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,000
I know where the gold is

239
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,120
Very soon

240
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,200
I'll bring it back to you

241
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,840
Hey

242
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
Second Brother

243
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
It really is you

244
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,600
Take me to see her

245
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,880
Where is she

246
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
Why are you in such a hurry

247
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,440
I never knew where she was

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
Where is she

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Give me the phone

250
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm not afraid of her

251
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,840
I'll call her

252
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,200
Don't rush

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,320
Let me show you something first

254
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
Who is this

255
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
I don't know

256
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,640
Mm

257
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Okay

258
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
Then give me some advice

259
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,120
You say they took my stuff

260
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,360
What should I do

261
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm going to pee

262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,960
Right here
