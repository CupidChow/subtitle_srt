1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
Ruirui

2
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
They hit you again.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,280
I can't take it anymore.

4
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,160
What are you doing?

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,240
I want to run away.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,080
But when I got here,

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,840
I thought about just jumping down.

8
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,360
Come on, come home with me.

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,560
Every time my little brother cries, it's always my fault.

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Today I couldn't help but talk back to him a little.

11
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,400
That man burned me with an iron.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,920
My mom just stood there and watched.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,840
The three of them are the real family.

14
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,080
If you're tired,

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,600
just lean on me.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,760
Can I do that for as long as I want?

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
As long as you want.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Come on, come home with me.

19
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Sister

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
Why are you up?

21
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister

22
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,920
Could you get me a glass of water?

23
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,120
I just pressed the nurse call button

24
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
but no one came.

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm really thirsty.

26
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
Alright, I'll go get some water.

27
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,000
Lie down quickly.

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Thank you.

29
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,720
Ning Ruirui

30
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,480
Don't

31
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,680
Don't move

32
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,120
Be careful

33
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,760
It's okay, don't be afraid

34
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,920
We're the police

35
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
We're here to help you

36
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Calm down

37
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,440
Ning Ruirui

38
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
I know

39
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
You can't accept that Yao Lan is gone

40
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,120
But you're not the one who hurt her

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
It was Wu Cong

42
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
And Liu Kui

43
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
Trust me

44
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,200
I will definitely catch them

45
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll make them, right in front of you

46
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
Face you

47
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Personally apologize to you and Yao Lan

48
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,560
Okay

49
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,600
Don't move

50
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,320
It's okay now

51
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,240
It's over

52
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,000
It's over

53
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,240
Come on

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,360
Slow down

55
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,640
Ning Ruirui

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,200
You are suspected of intentional homicide

57
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,440
You are now being arrested according to the law

58
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,160
It's been drawn

59
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,320
It's her

60
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,720
Okay

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,840
Go interrogate her quickly

62
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
I'll go

63
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,480
You go

64
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,360
What about you?

65
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Hurry up and go

66
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,240
How can you suspect me?

67
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,480
I'm the victim here.

68
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
The victim.

69
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,320
Then how do you explain this?

70
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
The poison dog dealer has already identified you.

71
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,120
He said you were the one who bought the poison.

72
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,800
That's impossible.

73
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,480
Even if you disguised yourself and fooled those people,

74
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
you can't fool me.

75
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,040
Even if you only showed your back,

76
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,760
I could still draw your face.

77
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,800
Even if I did buy the poison,

78
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,680
that doesn't prove I used it.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,520
Yao Lan wasn't poisoned to death.

80
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,320
She drowned.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,320
These are your fingerprints found on your bathtub.

82
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,040
Isn't it normal for my fingerprints to be in my own bathroom?

83
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
But on your fingerprints,

84
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
there was Yao Lan's vomit.

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,160
And the location where it was found

86
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
is enough to prove your position at the time.

87
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,040
You were holding Yao Lan's head down in the bathtub.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
You were very careful.

89
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,040
If you hadn't been suffering from the effects of the poison at the time,

90
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
and didn't have the strength to wipe off the fingerprints,

91
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,360
we probably wouldn't have found this evidence.

92
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
You know,

93
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,120
we can find out about the conflict between you and your brother.

94
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,800
So you wanted to use his poison dog syringe

95
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
to frame him.

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,200
What,

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,560
were you trying to kill two birds with one stone?

98
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,480
I never planned to frame Guo Long.

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,840
That medicine was prepared for him.

100
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
You wanted to kill Guo Long.

101
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes.

102
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Since I was fourteen,

103
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
my mother left with my younger brother.

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
Later,

105
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,680
she abandoned my brother too.

106
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,560
Guo Long started looking for me.

107
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,520
He wanted money.

108
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
He was always asking for money.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All these years,

110
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,560
it was Yao Lan who kept protecting you.

111
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
Since I was fifteen,

112
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,600
I moved into Yao Lan's home.

113
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,400
You'd definitely look good in these clothes.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,520
We got into college together.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,320
We've never been apart.

116
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
As long as she's around,

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm not afraid.

118
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,560
We moved many times.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,880
But Guo Long still found us.

120
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,760
He knew Yao Lan's boyfriend was wealthy.

121
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
So he started threatening me.

122
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,400
I don't have money for you.

123
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm not here for money.

124
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm just visiting.

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,120
Ow.

126
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
Ow.

127
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,720
Don't touch.

128
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,880
Ow.

129
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
Living such a happy life, huh?

130
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,240
Guo Long, what are you doing?

131
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,560
Living in such a nice place.

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,880
Your brother is suffering outside,

133
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
while the sister is enjoying herself here, right?

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Guo Long, what do you want? I don't have any money.

135
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm not here for money.

136
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm here to collect a debt.

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,080
What about what you promised me last month?

138
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
The sixty thousand yuan.

139
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
I don't have the money, I...

140
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,280
Sister.

141
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,280
This time I came

142
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,680
and brought you a gift.

143
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
An IOU.

144
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,680
Consider it a loan from me to you.

145
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,600
Isn't your best friend rich?

146
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,640
Go ask her for it.

147
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,480
No way.

148
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
Guo Long, I'm warning you.

149
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,440
If you dare go to Yao Lan,

150
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,800
I always try to be polite before using force.

151
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,240
If I don't get the money by noon tomorrow,

152
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,680
I'll cut up her face, one slice at a time.

153
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,960
Get lost.

154
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,800
Consider this the interest.

155
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,280
Come on.

156
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Let him try if he dares.

157
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
If he dares to show up,

158
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,440
A Kui will take care of him right away.

159
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,600
Don't be angry.

160
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,880
Ning Ruirui.

161
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,960
You can't go on like this.

162
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
You need to think of a solution quickly.

163
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,200
Cut ties with this family completely.

164
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,520
Completely cut ties?

165
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
But...

166
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,840
What are you afraid of?

167
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,120
Ning Ruirui.

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,840
Why are you so easy to bully?

169
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,480
Forget it, forget it.

170
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,600
Getting mad at you won't help.

171
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,560
Anyway, don't be afraid.

172
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I'll protect you.

173
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,920
Yao Lan is the only person in this world

174
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,480
the only one

175
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,880
who said she would protect me.

176
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,760
She treats me so well.

177
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
How could I possibly let Guo Long hurt her?

178
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,640
So you poisoned Guo Long

179
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
to protect yourself and Yao Lan?

180
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,720
Yes.

181
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880
Where exactly is Mom?

182
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm at the People's Hospital.

183
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,600
I checked every bed one by one.

184
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
There's no one here at all.

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,800
It's the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.

186
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,640
Who said it was the People's Hospital?

187
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,400
Why would someone be sent to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital after a car accident?

188
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
A car accident?

189
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,160
So now it's a car accident?

190
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
Guo Long, you're lying to me again.

191
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,840
Who said I'm lying to you?

192
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,920
Do you know that those twenty thousand yuan

193
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
were my last savings?

194
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
I was supposed to

195
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,480
give them to you today.

196
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,560
But it's just an empty card anyway.

197
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,120
I don't even want it.

198
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,760
I was supposed to go to Shanghai for an interview today.

199
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,880
If I went,

200
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
I would have had a chance.

201
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,400
Everything would have been better.

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,680
I just need one chance.

203
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
I only need this one.

204
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,960
So,

205
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,880
why are you crying in front of me?

206
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,520
Hurry up and go, why are you just standing there?

207
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,400
It's too late.

208
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,640
There's no time.

209
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
If there's no time, then just go die.

210
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,520
Turn around and jump from there.

211
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,320
They already had this kind of dog poison in their shop.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
Even if he was poisoned,

213
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,960
others would think

214
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,840
he accidentally pricked himself with his own poisoned needle.

215
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,520
This kind of thing happens often in their shop.

216
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
What about Wu Cong?

217
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Why kill him?

218
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Wu Cong

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,280
He was just a lovesick bookworm.

220
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,960
He drank too much and forgot who he was.

221
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
He dared to bully Yao Lan,

222
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
so I knocked him out.

223
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,320
Why did you kill Yao Lan?

224
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,360
Because Lanlan didn't want me anymore.

225
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,720
Lanlan

226
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
Lanlan, don't be impulsive.

227
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
There's definitely something wrong with this guy.

228
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
Maybe his money...

229
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,360
What's wrong with having money?

230
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,160
I just like him, so what?

231
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Think about it carefully.

232
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,400
How many years have you two been broken up?

233
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,880
He disappeared just like that.

234
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,960
-He says get back together, and you do? -Are you done talking?

235
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,160
Do you really know Liu Kui?

236
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,760
What if he was lying to you back then?

237
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,680
I told you to stop talking.

238
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Lanlan

239
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
He's back.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Lanlan, you...

241
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,600
A Kui
