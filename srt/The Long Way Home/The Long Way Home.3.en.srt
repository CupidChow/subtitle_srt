1
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,480
Ever since Yang Dong was released from prison,

2
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,280
he rarely interacted with other villagers.

3
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,400
That day, his house suddenly caught fire.

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,040
By the time the villagers arrived,

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
both he and the house were gone.

6
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,960
He was buried so quickly.

7
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
He didn't have any relatives or friends.

8
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
The villagers followed local customs

9
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
and buried him directly in the ground.

10
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Alright.

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
Then how did you confirm his identity?

12
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,400
He was the only one living in the house.

13
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Judging by the body size, it was indeed him.

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,240
Come help carry.

15
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,480
We really can carry it now.

16
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,040
Let's do it.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Yang Dong's last investigation before his death.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,080
Are there records of his height and weight?

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,920
There should be.

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,280
But they might be from a long time ago.

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
I'll go back and check.

22
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,320
The coffin is already here, why aren't you coming?

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,240
Open it.

24
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Forensic doctor.

25
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,080
What about this situation?

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,200
This is what we recently found out in Hongxing Village.

27
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,840
Where are you going?

28
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
Isn't the whole task force here?

29
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,480
What are you doing here if the task force is already present?

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
What do you mean by that?

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Isn't Dr. Zhou the forensic expert here too?

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Are you arguing with me?

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,760
Didn't you say we should cooperate?

34
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,320
I even dug up the grave.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,920
And now you're acting spoiled.

36
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,840
Look at you.

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,320
Go take a shower, quickly.

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Go.

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Go, go, go.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Go, go, go.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,360
Director Guo.

42
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,520
Yes?

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
The deceased is male.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,760
There is a contusion on the right elbow joint.

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,880
The left arm bone is broken.

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,640
He was likely beaten before death.

47
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,600
There is a blunt force injury above the clavicle.

48
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,280
But the wound shows no vital reaction to burning.

49
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Also, there is no soot in the mouth, nose, throat, or trachea.

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,520
So the victim was beaten first,

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,920
and then the body was burned.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,760
That's right.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Look here.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
This blunt force injury at the back of the head

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
is likely the cause of death.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,760
Did you notice anything else?

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,440
The victim's age should be

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,200
between eighteen and twenty-five.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,880
Wait a moment.

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,240
The age is between eighteen and twenty-five.

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,720
Yes.

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,800
The bone age can't be wrong.

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,960
Remember this clearly.

64
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,440
Zhao Zhi.

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
Yang Dong is already thirty-two.

66
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
The victim inside isn't him.

67
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,160
Then where is Yang Dong?

68
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,560
Find him as soon as possible.

69
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,440
Qichu

70
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
From the main team

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
You forced your way in too

72
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,000
Last night

73
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,720
Lin Shen took you down in just a few moves

74
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
Isn't your fighting skill a bit lacking?

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm here to solve cases

76
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
Not to fight

77
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,360
Why do you think they'd want you?

78
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Alright, alright.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,320
Stop staring, I know I'm handsome.

80
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
You know, ever since I was little—

81
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
Back in first grade—

82
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,080
You were a chubby kid.

83
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
A really chubby kid.

84
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
How did you know?

85
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I'm a sketch artist.

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,160
The most urgent thing right now

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,400
is to quickly identify the victim.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
The DNA we've collected

89
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,360
doesn't match anything in the database.

90
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
And no one nearby has reported anyone missing.

91
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,360
So I want to apply for a skull reconstruction.

92
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
Only the provincial department has that technology.

93
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I've already asked.

94
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,120
It'll take at least a month.

95
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
A month is too long.

96
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,160
That's way too long.

97
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Why are you looking at her?

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,400
Let her sit down.

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
I've never seen this girl so serious before.

100
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,960
Maybe she has a solution.

101
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,280
Why not let her try?

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
Let me think about it.

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,480
Captain Zhao sure has a temper.

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,680
Hey.

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
I heard sketch artists can draw people older or younger.

106
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,440
Can you even figure out if someone was fat or thin?

107
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,360
No, I can't.

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,200
That's what Zhang Liang told me.

109
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,680
How about we have a little competition?

110
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,240
Compete in what?

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
See who gets into the task force first.

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
Then you're definitely going to lose.

113
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
We'll see who has the skills.

114
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,240
What era do you think this is?

115
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Still relying on drawing?

116
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,600
Zhang Liang.

117
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,160
Get to work.

118
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:09,880
What are you doing?

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
Zhao Zhi, thanks for your hard work.

120
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,120
Have an extra meal.

121
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
What's up?

122
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,160
I made these ribs myself.

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
They're still hot.

124
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Let's eat and talk.

125
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,800
I just finished reading the autopsy report.

126
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,680
Have some fruit.

127
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,160
If you have something to say, just say it.

128
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,400
Let's make a deal.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,720
Haven't you always wanted to do a skull reconstruction?

130
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,040
I'll help you.

131
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,560
And then?

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
I join the special task force.

133
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't you have anything else to do all day?

134
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Always keeping an eye on me.

135
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
I'm not watching you.

136
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm watching the special task force.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,120
You know, in our line of work,

138
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
who doesn't want to crack a big case?

139
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,320
Make a big achievement.

140
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,360
Cases aren't about size.

141
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,000
But abilities do differ.

142
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,800
Anyway, just trust me.

143
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,160
I guarantee I'll get the job done.

144
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,000
How can you prove it?

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll give you a big gift right now.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,320
Let's go.

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,520
No, that's not it.

148
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
Please.

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,600
What are you doing?

150
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
Playing a game.

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
This is the simulated facial reconstruction of the deceased.

152
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,040
I didn't sleep well.

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,960
Are your eyes seeing double?

154
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
Is this a potato or a human face?

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
I'll fine-tune it a bit more.

156
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,040
Right away.

157
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,040
Right away.

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,040
Alright, alright, that's enough. Break it up.

159
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,600
That's pretty good.

160
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm quite happy right now.

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,520
No, no, Zhao Zhi.

162
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Thanks.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,080
Liangzi is only at this level.

164
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
There's nothing I can do about it either.

165
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,760
Xiao Yu.

166
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,160
Yeah?

167
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
I have a way.

168
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
Who let you in?

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,320
I said I have a way.

170
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,640
And it's the only way.

171
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,520
You have no choice.

172
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
What do you mean?

173
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
I can reconstruct the victim's appearance.

174
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
Where did you get the photo?

175
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,200
I just remembered something urgent.

176
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,800
You guys go ahead.

177
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,680
Hello?

178
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,360
Hello?

179
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
How long does skull reconstruction take?

180
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,280
If we start right now,

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,840
five days.

182
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,840
Three days.

183
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,120
I guarantee the task will be done.

184
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,320
The victim is male.

185
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
There is a contusion on the right elbow joint.

186
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,120
The left arm bone is broken.

187
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,920
He was likely beaten before death.

188
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
There is a blunt force injury above the collarbone.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,040
But the wound shows no signs of post-burn vital reaction.

190
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,240
Also, there is no soot in the mouth, nose, throat, or trachea.

191
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,960
This blunt force injury at the back of the head

192
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,560
is likely the cause of death.

193
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,080
The victim was beaten first

194
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
and then the body was burned.

195
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,760
The victim's age should be

196
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,320
between eighteen and twenty-five years old.

197
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,800
Zhao Zhi

198
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,320
It's been drawn.

199
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,480
This is still just a child.

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,120
Xiao Yu

201
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,800
Hey.

202
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,840
Come here.

203
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Take it and compare.

204
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,440
Okay.

205
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,560
Master

206
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
I redrew it.

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,640
This won't do.

208
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,480
You need to understand what the witness said first.

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,360
Then start drawing.

210
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,600
Continue.

211
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,360
How is it?

212
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,080
Right away.

213
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,640
Zhao Zhi

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,280
The comparison results are out.

215
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,720
Wang Ziyan
