1
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,040
Zhao Shi

2
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
You two, hurry up and eat.

3
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,200
Zhao Shi

4
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,600
Mm.

5
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,360
Eat.

6
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,440
Remember this.

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
Three thirty in the afternoon.

8
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
First floor of the Youth Center.

9
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:30,960
Okay.

10
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,520
Say it again.

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,280
One thirty, third floor of the Youth Center.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,640
Three thirty, first floor.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,760
Three thirty.

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,360
Qiqi

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Mom's leaving now.

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,040
Okay.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,280
Hello?

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The target has appeared.

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
For this kind of fleeting short-term memory,

20
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,000
if you only rely on describing someone's nose

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
or what their eyes look like,

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,360
there can actually be a big deviation.

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,400
But if you describe a person as

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,040
thin,

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,720
fierce,

26
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,920
to me,

27
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,440
those are actually more valuable features.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,440
How are they valuable?

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,680
It means this person's facial features

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
are in unusual positions on their face.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
They're not harmonious.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,800
To me,

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,040
features are more important than details.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
Then if you can draw,

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
why did you still come to the village?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,720
Because light

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,160
is also very important.

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Alright.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,560
To the left.

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,520
Move yourself a bit to the left.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,360
Turn.

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
Turn your face back a little.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,760
Okay.

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,440
It's lit.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,240
Don't move.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
It's not time yet.

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,880
Wait until it gets a bit darker.

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Don't move.

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
Why are you always bossing me around?

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,080
Why don't you do this to Zhao Shi?

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
Do you have a problem with that?

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't think I don't know.

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,560
You two

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,320
have a secret.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
No need to answer me.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,760
I like to investigate this kind of gossip myself.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
You'll never find out in your whole life.

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,480
Ah.

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm telling you,

60
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
you'll never find out in your whole life.

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,360
Don't underestimate me.

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,200
I am, after all...

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,880
Light it.

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,040
I think...

65
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,640
Don't move.

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,240
-According to my guess...  -Don't move.

67
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,880
Turn around.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,880
Turn your face a bit.

69
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,400
Okay.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Lift your head.

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,720
Okay.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
It's really smoky.

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,760
Bear with it.

74
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
Have you seen this person?

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
No.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,480
What about this one?

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,600
Does this look like him?

78
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,800
It doesn't really look like him.

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
How about this one?

80
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,240
It looks a bit like him.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

82
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,640
Is it him?

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes, that's him.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,080
Zhao Zhi

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,920
This should be what he looks like from the front.

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,880
It's actually him.

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,600
You know him?

88
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,480
Wu Shouwei.

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
I arrested him four years ago.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,200
This Wu Shouwei,

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,200
I remember him.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,560
In 2006, he was convicted of arson.

93
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,160
He served three years in our prison.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
But the year he was supposed to be released,

95
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,280
he suddenly got into a serious fight.

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,080
He got an extra six months added to his sentence.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,280
Do we know why he fought?

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
Ten years ago, his son went missing.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
His wife couldn't take it.

100
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,400
She drank pesticide and killed herself.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,640
Then, his cellmate

102
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,880
used this to provoke him.

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,800
So he got into a conflict with that person.

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,040
The child went missing.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,640
Was he kidnapped?

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes.

107
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,920
The trafficker still hasn't been caught.

108
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Warden.

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,160
Yes?

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,960
You guys keep talking.

111
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm stepping out for a bit.

112
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,680
I think I've figured it out.

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,320
Figured out what?

114
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,800
The truth.

115
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,840
Think about it.

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,000
Yang Dong and Liu Kui knew each other from before.

117
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
So they must know

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,160
or even have been involved in human trafficking.

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
Then Wu Shouwei's son...

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
Wu Shouwei's son was kidnapped.

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
After he got out of prison,

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,800
he wanted revenge.

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Wang Ziyan was killed by mistake.

124
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,880
Wu Shouwei didn't want to kill Wang Ziyan.

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
He wanted to kill Yang Dong.

126
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Zhao Zhi has found out.

127
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,160
Wu Shouwei is now working at Jixiang Distillery.

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
The distillery is inside the West Street Market.

129
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
Okay, got it.

130
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,480
Take some people over there.

131
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
We'll meet up on the way.

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,040
Yes.

133
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,000
So that means,

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,320
Wu Shouwei was waiting in advance at Yang Dong's house.

135
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,240
He was looking for a chance to take revenge.

136
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,760
But he accidentally killed Wang Ziyan, who entered by mistake.

137
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,960
This Wu Shouwei has been following Yang Dong.

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
Could he know something about the trafficking gang?

139
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,320
We'll find out soon.

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Where is he?

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,400
Over there.

142
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
Xiaoyu, Zhang Liang, flank from behind.

143
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,960
Lin Shen.

144
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,320
Lead the way.

145
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Let's go.

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,400
Wu Shouwei

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,960
Stop

148
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Wu Shouwei, come down

149
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,920
Come down

150
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,920
Go to the front

151
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Come down

152
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,040
Wu Shouwei, slow down

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Come down

154
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Come down

155
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,880
I'll kill you

156
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,840
Don't move

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Don't move

158
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Wu Shouwei

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,320
You are suspected of murder

160
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,640
You are now being arrested according to the law

161
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,040
Don't move

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,560
Take him away

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Everyone, stop watching

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's disperse

165
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,920
The police are handling a case here

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,800
Everyone, go back

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,680
Disperse, disperse

168
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:15,960
Stop watching, everyone

169
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,480
Disperse, disperse

170
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Everyone, leave

171
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,960
Stop watching, stop watching

172
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,800
Go back, everyone

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,360
Little one

174
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,680
Why are you here by yourself?

175
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
Where is your family?

176
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,880
Oh, then hurry and find your family

177
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
Don't get lost

178
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,040
The police are here

179
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,880
Everyone, disperse, disperse

180
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,520
Disperse

181
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,360
Go

182
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,600
He was just unlucky.

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,720
He can't blame anyone else for that.

184
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,600
Wu Shouwei.

185
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,760
Why did you set the fire later?

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
I set the fire just to make things easier.

187
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,040
Save me.

188
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
I thought it was Yang Dong.

189
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,840
Later, I realized I killed the wrong person.

190
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,240
Oh no.

191
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,200
Sentence, sentence, sentence.

192
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,680
Isn't it just death?

193
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
You want to die.

194
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,600
Just because you want to die doesn't mean you can take someone else's life.

195
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,200
My wife's life is gone.

196
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
My son's life is gone.

197
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,920
How could I let him live?

198
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,400
I had to kill him.

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,160
There's no chance now.

200
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,560
If I had the chance, I'd still kill him.

201
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
He has to be dealt with.

202
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,320
How's the interrogation going?

203
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,240
Beef.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,800
I can't eat it.

205
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,520
You bought it for me.

206
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,840
Yeah.

207
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,400
I am actually a bit hungry.

208
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,600
What's this drawing?

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
Don't touch my stuff.

210
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:46,920
Hey.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,440
Who is this?

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,560
Who is this?

213
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:49,920
Who?

214
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,520
Be honest.

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,240
Zhao Zhi.

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Who is this?

217
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,360
If you have nothing else,

218
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
Wang Ziyan's case report is over there.

219
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,600
Remember to sign it.

220
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,040
Will she look like this?

221
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I think

222
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,120
she will.

223
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,440
Hello, Zhao Da.

224
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,920
Zhao Da.

225
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,200
Zhao Da.

226
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,960
Hello, Zhao Da.

227
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,000
Zhao Da.

228
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,480
Hey.

229
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,520
Master.

230
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,800
I redrew it again.

231
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
This won't do.

232
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,760
You need to understand what the witness said first.

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,640
Then start drawing.

234
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,840
Continue.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,040
Where's Qiqi?

236
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,400
She was picked up earlier.

237
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,600
She finished her homework too.

238
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
She's playing outside.

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,600
Hey.

240
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
You didn't buy her another popsicle, did you?

241
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,720
Of course I did.

242
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
How would she do her homework without it?

243
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Qiqi.

244
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Qiqi.

245
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,280
Qiqi.

246
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,800
Qiqi.
