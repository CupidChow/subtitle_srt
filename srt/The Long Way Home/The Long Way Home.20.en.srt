1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,720
Dad

2
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
Dad

3
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Dad

4
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
Why are you here?

5
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,840
Dad has something to do.

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,160
Go stay at Aunt Su Yun's house for a few days.

7
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
Together

8
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,600
No

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,080
Will you die?

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
Of course not.

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,840
I'll come back to pick you up.

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,880
Promise me

13
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
I promise you

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll come back for you very soon.

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,400
Take good care of her for me.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
Mumu

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,120
You don't know me.

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,680
Is anyone hurt?

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
Don't be afraid.

20
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,880
Someone will come to save us soon.

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,720
Trust me.

22
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,440
I'll trust you one more time.

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,160
Someone will definitely come to save us.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
Get down quickly.

25
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,240
Go. Keep an eye on everything for me.

26
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,120
Brother Lai

27
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,000
We saw that kid at the mute's house.

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
But Luo Haixiao has never shown up.

29
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
Bring the kid back.

30
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,280
That's a good card to play.

31
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
Understood.

32
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
It's seven thirty, Brother Lai.

33
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
Let's go.

34
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,920
Let's go load the goods.

35
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Alright.

36
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,200
Gu Da found the only fish market dock in Luhua Town.

37
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
It's called Shengfa Fish Market Dock.

38
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Request backup immediately.

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
Don't shout.

40
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,200
Don't yell.

41
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,640
Stay quiet.

42
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Hurry, open it.

43
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,960
The lock is broken, it won't open.

44
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,080
Is it this key?

45
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,040
Ah!

46
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,240
It's blocked.

47
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,960
Kick it open!

48
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
It won't open.

49
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Run!

50
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,040
Who are you?

51
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Don't move, police!

52
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Hold him down.

53
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,800
Come with me.

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,000
Go forward.

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,520
Qi Chu!

56
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,920
Hurry!

57
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,840
All the children are here.

58
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000
Save the children, hurry!

59
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,920
Lin Shen!

60
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,680
There's a lock.

61
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Unlock it.

62
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,640
Slow down.

63
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,480
Be careful.

64
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,000
It's okay.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Take it easy.

66
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Be careful.

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,040
Watch out.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Let's go.

69
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,360
All right.

70
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,200
There are two more.

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,000
Come on, take it slow.

72
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
Careful, don't be afraid.

73
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,600
Mumu.

74
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,520
It's okay.

75
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,400
Count the people.

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,120
Are there any more?

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,880
Count and check everyone.

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
Has Zhang Guiping come here?

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,960
Over there, let's go.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Protect the children.

81
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Go.

82
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,840
You follow along.

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,680
What are you doing?

84
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,520
Wrap it up, Zhang Liang.

85
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
Okay.

86
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,280
Xiao Xu.

87
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,080
Everyone, move faster.

88
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,920
- Keep some order. - Take them this way.

89
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,720
Hurry up.

90
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Are you okay?

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,160
I'm fine.

92
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
That's so ugly.

93
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Hurry up and take off your makeup.

94
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,920
Director Guo.

95
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Reporting, Director Du.

96
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
All thirteen children have been rescued.

97
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
Well done.

98
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,720
Director Du, Director Guo.

99
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Yes.

100
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,640
I heard you discovered this hideout.

101
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,800
And went undercover here.

102
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
You bought us time.

103
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,960
You deserve praise.

104
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Thank you, Director Du.

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,160
Reporting, Director Du.

106
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,920
A Lai and Zhang Guiping have not been caught yet.

107
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,280
We already have a plan.

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,480
Hurry up, we need to move faster.

109
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,800
Yes.

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
There's also an older sister.

111
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,080
What older sister?

112
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,960
An older sister holding a doll.

113
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,200
Seal off Neijiang immediately.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,840
Conduct a thorough search.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,600
Yes.

116
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,320
Let's go.

117
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,800
Hello? What's up? I'm busy.

118
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,200
It's an emergency.

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,880
My people told me

120
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,160
yesterday in Dafeng Village

121
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,320
a woman and a child were kidnapped.

122
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Something this serious,

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
why are you calling me?

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,680
Call the police.

125
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Report it to your local police station.

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,120
Why are you reporting it to me?

127
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,560
Just listen to me first.

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,120
I remember that woman, her name is Su Yun.

129
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,560
She used to be Huang Jiang's girlfriend.

130
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
And the one you're looking for,

131
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
uh, what's his name...

132
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,440
Don't stutter.

133
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,440
She has connections to Luo Haixiao and his people.

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
A woman holding a baby.

135
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,560
Send me the address.

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,960
What's going on?

137
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,400
A new address.

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,440
Go to Su Yun's house.

139
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,200
It's right here.

140
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,440
Xinhe

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Are you Su Yun?

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,080
Go upstairs and take a look.

143
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,480
Okay.

144
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,200
Don't be afraid.

145
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,760
It's okay.

146
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,640
We're the police.

147
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
We're here to help you.

148
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,000
It's okay.

149
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,040
You're Su Yun, right?

150
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Come.

151
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,320
What did she say?

152
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
She asked us to save the children.

153
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
All the children have been rescued.

154
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
All thirteen, not a single one missing.

155
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,000
Yours.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,120
Your child.

157
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,000
Someone took your child.

158
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Do you know who took them?

159
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,840
A Lai.

160
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,000
Aunt Gui.

161
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,200
Do you know where they are?

162
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,280
The station.

163
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,920
The station.

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
Call for backup.

165
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,080
It's okay.

166
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,600
Brother Hai

167
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,440
Brother Hai

168
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,080
It was all Brother Lai who forced me.

169
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,800
You scared my daughter.

170
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,760
I wouldn't dare scare her.

171
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,920
Look here, and here too.

172
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,080
She bit me here.

173
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,520
She's a little troublemaker.

174
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Brother Hai

175
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,840
Please let me go.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,920
Where is Aunt Gui?

177
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,640
I don't know.

178
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Where is Aunt Gui?

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,680
I really don't know.

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Wang He

181
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Follow.

182
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
Okay.

183
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,840
Brother Lai

184
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
The thing you wanted has shown up.

185
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Brother Hai

186
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,680
Please don't come at me.

187
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,120
Brother Hai

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,960
I...

189
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,400
I really don't know.

190
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
It has nothing to do with me.

191
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,160
Let me go.

192
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll help you check.

193
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,800
Let me go.

194
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,600
I...

195
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,480
I'll check.

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,920
I'll go.

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,840
Where is Aunt Gui?

198
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Where?

199
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,840
Taining Bus Station.

200
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,920
How did you know I knew where she was?

201
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,640
You were the one who arranged her passport.
