1
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,560
We did it, bro.

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Bro.

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,360
Once we finish off Tang Cheng, we'll have the gold.

4
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
The good days will come.

5
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,280
You'd better think it through.

6
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,960
Are you taking these or not?

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880
I'm just afraid you'll get it but won't live to spend it.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,560
Hahaha.

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Ah.

10
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,320
Xiao Jiang.

11
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Xiao Jiang.

12
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Xiao Jiang.

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
Xiao Jiang.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Xiao Jiang.

15
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,200
We got our gold back.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,600
Keep it safe.

17
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
Wait until I avenge you.

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Someone will bring me to see you.

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,760
You can only take five of these.

20
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
Otherwise, your liver will be ruined.

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Um...

22
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,400
That's for lung cancer.

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
Looking for your money.

24
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
Zhang Guiping

25
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,920
Zhang Guiping

26
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm here.

27
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Zhang Guiping

28
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
I've arrived.

29
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,360
Hello?

30
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm at the repair shop.

31
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,520
Put the gold in the trunk of the black car.

32
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
I'll wait for you at the bus station in ten minutes.

33
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,000
The gold is here.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
After my people get the gold,

35
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
I'll return Xiaogu to you.

36
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,560
Okay.

37
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,320
You have no choice.

38
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,800
Mom.

39
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,600
Mom.

40
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,440
It's facing the right way.

41
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,120
This is your work badge.

42
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,360
Be careful.

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,120
Alright, let's go.

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Don't worry about me.

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,920
Go, go, go.

46
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm leaving.

47
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
Zhang Guiping

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm here.

49
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,800
Hello

50
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Officer Zhao

51
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,160
Guess how Su Yun knew Xiao Gu was at the bus station

52
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
Come quickly

53
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,040
I have another big gift for you

54
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,800
If you're late

55
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,560
there will be nothing left

56
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,120
Don't play tricks

57
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,280
There are eighty buses at this passenger station.

58
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,240
There are twenty trucks.

59
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,760
There is a warehouse on each side.

60
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
That is the dormitory building.

61
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,080
There is an auto repair shop in both the southeast and southwest corners.

62
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
There is a gas station at the southernmost end.

63
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
There are a total of eight entrances and exits here.

64
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
Backup is already on the way.

65
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,280
Our top priority is to rescue the hostages.

66
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,520
Team Two, check the warehouses first.

67
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,760
- Okay. - Let's go.

68
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,120
Mom.

69
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,040
Tonight, I have to kill you.

70
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
Xiao Hai.

71
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,240
I definitely won't die today.

72
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Let's go.

73
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Think about it.

74
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,000
What do you want most?

75
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,680
Gold.

76
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,400
Me.

77
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
Your daughter.

78
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,040
There are two of A Lai's men over there, seriously injured.

79
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Secure them.

80
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,240
Okay.

81
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,480
Warehouse.

82
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Go.

83
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,120
You child...

84
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,440
You've always been indecisive since you were little.

85
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,960
Choose.

86
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,280
Gold.

87
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,720
Me.

88
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,600
Or your daughter.

89
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll choose for you.

90
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,600
Police! Don't move!

91
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,880
Don't move!

92
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,560
This time, your sister didn't let go.

93
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Didn't let go.

94
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,520
Zhao Zhi.

95
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,200
Master.

96
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,440
Hello

97
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,080
Brother Lai

98
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,120
The gold bar is fake

99
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,680
Hurry up.

100
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,120
We're going to be late.

101
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,680
Hurry, hurry, we're late!

102
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,160
Master.

103
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,480
Coming.

104
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,120
Sister.

105
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,760
Um...

106
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
The performance is at 3:30.

107
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,920
It's in the auditorium on the first floor of the Youth Center.

108
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Don't forget.

109
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,680
Okay.

110
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,320
There's water in the bag.

111
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,760
Oh.

112
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
-Dad's leaving. -Dad, your hairstyle looks terrible.

113
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Oh, Dad really doesn't have time.

114
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,880
Let Sister Chuchu do your hair, okay?

115
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,720
-I meant your hair. -Mine?

116
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,160
Okay.

117
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:40,840
Are you done?

118
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,120
Alright, done.

119
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,120
Then Dad's leaving.

120
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
Sweetie, do your best in the performance.

121
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,480
When you come back, Dad will be your personal audience.

122
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,960
Okay, can I watch it one more time?

123
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,400
Qiqi.

124
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,840
Dad will definitely find you.

125
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
He definitely will.

126
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Zhao Zhi.

127
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,920
Luo Haixiao.

128
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,800
Xiaogu.

129
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,240
Don't worry.

130
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
Xiaogu is very safe now.

131
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,120
She'll be well taken care of at the Children's Home.

132
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,080
Why did you take the bullet for her?

133
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
Because I have a daughter too.

134
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Luo Haixiao.

135
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,920
Now,

136
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
it's time to tell your story.

137
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,880
A Lai said

138
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,960
Aunt Gui calls you the Five Tigers

139
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,800
Five Tigers
