1
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
This woman

2
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
is swimming and holding a ball.

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
I want to ride a Donald Duck float.

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,000
What are you doing?

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
You.

6
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,720
She's a model.

7
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,320
Why isn't she wearing clothes?

8
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,320
Exactly.

9
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,120
I don't get it.

10
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,040
I can't open the camera latch.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
How do you see the photos?

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,160
Wait until this roll is finished.

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,480
Then just develop them.

14
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
How do you develop them?

15
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,360
That's true.

16
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,200
Whatever.

17
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,400
Let's just take it back first.

18
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Can we take a photo, Akui?

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,400
Sure.

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,040
So who presses this button?

21
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,280
I know, I know.

22
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,600
Turn this part.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,680
Then when you hear the clicking sound,

24
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,120
hurry over.

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,880
Really.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
What if it breaks?

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,040
Move aside.

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,560
Let me do it.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,120
Everyone, move over.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,840
Sit properly.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
Look at the dates on these photos.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,560
1990

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,400
1992

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
And 2002

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,600
They should be the same group of people.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,040
It's more than just the same group.

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
Based on their facial features,

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
Liu Kui

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,240
Yang Dong

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,120
Xu Honglai

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
Then who are these two?

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760
I haven't seen them before.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,400
This one

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,000
should be Luo Haixiao.

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,080
The film is too old.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
You can't see this woman's face clearly either.

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,600
She is the

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,120
mother of these five people.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,600
Qi Chu

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,560
Can you draw what this woman looks like now?

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,320
Yes.

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,840
Luchaibang

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Tang Cheng's

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,040
Luchaibang

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,000
Luchaibang

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,160
There's a story called "Contract Child Laborers."

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Have you heard of it?

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
It talks about a child laborer

59
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
who is called Luchaibang.

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,280
Those children,

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,960
after entering Tang Cheng's illegal factory,

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,480
would all be

63
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
branded with this mark.

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
They all called these children

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
Luchaibang.

66
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,320
Tang Cheng said

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,760
to find a few more young ones

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
to go down the mine.

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,240
Stand still.

70
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,200
Where are they taking us?

71
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
Down... down into the cave.

72
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,800
What?

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,760
It was like this last time.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,920
Douya went into the mountains with them.

75
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
And never came back.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
I'm not going.

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,560
I don't want to go into the cave.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
I want to go home.

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,440
What are you trying to do?

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Just wait and see how I deal with you when I get back.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,000
Watch him.

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Are you okay?

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm fine.

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,400
Run! Run! Run!

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Hurry! Go!

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
Quick!

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,680
Where did they go after that?

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,000
After that...

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Go on.

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
They kept hiding everywhere.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Sometimes hungry, sometimes full.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
Because they weren't properly disciplined,

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
when they grew up,

94
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,760
they also acted recklessly.

95
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
They became people no one dared to mess with.

96
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,160
The bullies of the street.

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Move aside.

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
Why is it so hot?

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
Don't make too much noise.

100
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Once inside, one person controls Tang Cheng and the bodyguard.

101
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,040
One person opens the safe.

102
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,200
Who will go?

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,000
Draw lots.

104
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,120
Bro.

105
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
We got picked.

106
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Once we get the gold,

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,560
our good days will begin.

108
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Tang Cheng

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,440
He was once the richest man in Taining.

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,360
That's right.

111
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,080
He was sentenced to life imprisonment a couple of years ago.

112
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
Yes.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
He even dared to use child labor.

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,560
Over twenty years ago,

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,840
it was really shady.

116
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,360
The lucky ones could stay in the factory.

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,640
The unlucky ones

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,360
were all sent to the mines.

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,960
They dug mines for Tang Cheng.

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,680
Gold mines.

121
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,920
He made children dig in the mines.

122
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,080
What else could he do?

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,440
The entrance to the mine was tiny.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,640
Only children could fit in to dig.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,960
If he hadn't been so ruthless,

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,640
could he have made so much money?

127
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,720
Of course.

128
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,920
This is just what I've heard.

129
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,280
I haven't seen it with my own eyes.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,840
You people in the business

131
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,720
Go on.

132
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,360
Eight years ago,

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
on a pitch-black night,

134
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,840
there were two of these

135
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,440
skinny kids

136
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
who broke into Tang Cheng's house

137
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
and stole his gold.

138
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,320
So dumb.

139
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,200
If you want something, just say it.

140
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,640
You took this stuff.

141
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,560
And you even broke my cabinet.

142
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
You pauper.

143
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Never seen so many gold bars, have you?

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,560
Don’t take too few.

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
It’s not worth it.

146
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,040
Why are you trying to act tough with me?

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,560
Do you know where you are?

148
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,520
You think you can come and go as you please.

149
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
Leave whenever you want.

150
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
You’d better think it through.

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,200
Are you taking this stuff or not?

152
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,520
I’m just afraid you’ll get it but won’t live to spend it.

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Tang Cheng

154
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,280
Eight years ago

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
Are you sure you remember?

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm sure.

157
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Tang Cheng said it himself.

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
When he was tied up,

159
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
he saw clearly

160
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,960
that one of them

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,680
had, right under his neck,

162
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,000
this brand.

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
Didn't he call the police?

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,960
Are you stupid?

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,840
Was that gold clean?

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
If Tang Cheng dared to call the police,

167
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,800
If Tang Cheng really dared to call the police,

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,880
would they still go rob?

169
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,440
It was criminals robbing criminals.

170
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,400
Right.

171
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,920
Criminals robbing criminals.

172
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,840
Just had to swallow the loss.

173
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
You guys didn't know back then.

174
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
We knew very well.

175
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,600
Tang Cheng said at the time,

176
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
if you find the gold

177
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,880
and take care of those two thieves for him,

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,640
he'd pay a million.

179
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,080
And then?

180
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,840
How could there be a "then"? Was it that easy to find?

181
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,760
We wanted to find it too.

182
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
A million.

183
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,680
It's not like we didn't want it.

184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,760
We just never found it.

185
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,160
The people

186
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,120
and the gold

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,640
were both gone.

188
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Not a single clue.

189
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
They vanished without a trace.

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
How many gold bars are there?

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
I heard there are about thirty.

192
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
At the gold price back then,

193
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,800
that's three million.

194
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,040
What about Yang Dong?

195
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Where's Mom?

196
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
Looks like we still haven't gotten the goods.

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Yang Dong was probably killed.

198
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,720
The gold is gone.

199
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,120
What happened?

200
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,160
Your little girlfriend is dead.

201
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,080
She was poisoned.

202
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,520
Mom did it.

203
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,040
There's news from Wu Su.

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Go back and keep the buyer calm.

205
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,440
Just wait for the goods.

206
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
The gold bars still haven't been found.

207
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
Is it just for the gold bars?

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,680
What else?

209
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
Big brother.

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,360
You're already on the police's radar.

211
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
You should leave for now.

212
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,560
And one more thing.

213
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,520
Be careful when picking up the goods this time.

214
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
Don't get blown up again.

215
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,160
Help!

216
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,680
Big Brother

217
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,480
I'm only telling you

218
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,640
Something happened to the goods

219
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
How did you know it was blown up?

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,200
I...

221
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,360
I...

222
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:05,920
I...

223
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
Xiao Wu

224
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,560
You're the only brother I have left

225
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,040
Even you betrayed me

226
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Big Brother

227
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Big Brother

228
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,840
Big...

229
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,640
Big Brother

230
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
Mom ordered it to be blown up

231
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
Mom ordered it

232
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,800
It was Mom

233
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
Mom ordered it to be blown up

234
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Why?

235
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,560
She said

236
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,840
Children who lie never end well

237
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,440
Last time

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
Last time, when she dealt with Third Brother

239
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,720
She said the same thing

240
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:03,840
Brother

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,000
Brother

242
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
Don't go against her

243
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
It's really for your own good
