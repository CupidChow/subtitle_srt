1
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
The time of death should be this morning.

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,240
Between nine and eleven o'clock.

3
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,320
The neck is broken.

4
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
That should be the cause of death.

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,960
It looks like it was deliberately broken by someone stepping on it.

6
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,600
Also, on the ground nearby

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,760
there are several footprints left.

8
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,200
These steps are not evenly spaced.

9
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,960
The first few are about the same distance apart.

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,880
But over here,

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,120
they get a bit deeper.

12
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,920
It seems there was a brief pause

13
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,080
for a short rest.

14
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,920
One possibility is that the killer was injured.

15
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,120
Another possibility is

16
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
he has health problems himself.

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
Based on these footprints, we can determine

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
the killer's height should be

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
around 1.75 meters.

20
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,040
A male weighing about 70 kilograms.

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,800
Judging by the wear pattern on the sole,

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,360
the killer's age should be

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,640
between thirty-five and forty.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Zhao Zhi.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,480
A fruit farmer said that car is his.

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
I think it happened when Yang Dong stole the car and was escaping.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
That's when the accident happened.

28
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,800
But we haven't found any other witnesses yet.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,040
Does anyone in the village know him?

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,600
No.

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
Everyone says they've never seen him.

32
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
He probably just showed up here by chance.

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,760
By chance.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,760
Zhao Zhi.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Come take a look.

36
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
There's a brand mark here.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,520
Do you guys feel

38
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,320
there's something unusual about the place where Yang Dong died?

39
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,200
From another perspective,

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,280
what makes this place special to Yang Dong?

41
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,240
Why did he choose to steal a car there?

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Judging by the skid marks on the ground,

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
the car was already at its maximum speed.

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
You said it was a place where no one knew him,

45
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,520
so why did he run?

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Also, the mud on the ground all came from the riverside.

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
What were he and the killer doing by the river?

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
Wu Shouwei said

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,360
Liu Kui was looking for something Yang Dong had hidden.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,680
Could it be somewhere nearby?

51
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,280
Liu Kui.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,240
Has the data from Yang Dong's phone been recovered?

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Lin Shen said it will probably take another hour.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,760
I'll go check on it.

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,320
I need to go to Liu Kui's transport company.

56
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,840
Right now?

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,440
Yes.

58
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
We know too little about them.

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,120
We can't figure out the relationship between Liu Kui and Yang Dong.

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
We don't know what Liu Kui is after.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,520
We can't solve the case like this.

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,400
Zhao Zhi.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Let me go with you.

64
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Go where?

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,080
Stay at home.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't call me Zhao Zhi.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm still your mentor.

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Sir, I...

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,800
Hey.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,600
You...

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:16,880
Who are you?

72
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm from out of town.

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
I came here to look for a relative.

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,920
I've been asking around for a long time and still don't know.

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,960
I just want to ask for some information.

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,320
Oh.

77
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,200
Come in.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,040
Sure.

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,600
Okay.

80
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:32,920
Alright.

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

82
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
You have no idea.

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
I've asked all around.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
They're all locals.

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
How come nobody knows anything?

86
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,200
You're looking for someone?

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,520
Yeah.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
Oh.

89
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
Then you've come to the right person.

90
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,520
I've been here

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
my whole life.

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Oh wow.

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,120
There's no one I don't know.

94
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Oh wow.

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,800
You've found the right person.

96
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
That's great.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,360
Oh wow.

99
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,280
This is a relative from my family.

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,120
Take a look.

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,640
Do you recognize them?

102
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,960
This one...

103
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,960
This...

104
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,920
This person...

105
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,320
Hey

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
Isn't this our boss

107
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,360
A'Kui?

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,480
Liu Kui

109
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,120
Oh wow

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,640
A'Kui is your boss?

111
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Oh wow

113
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
He's made something of himself

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,320
A'Kui became a boss

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
Yeah

116
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
We're all family

117
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,360
That's great

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,920
We're all family

119
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Look at me

120
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
Come

121
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
I don't have anything fancy

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,080
Just a little wine

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,320
Just a little wine

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
We're all family

125
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
So happy, so happy

126
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Come on, come on

127
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,400
Oh dear

128
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
So happy

129
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,840
Sir

130
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
So, where do you think I can find A'Kui?

131
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
Where are you going to look for him?

132
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,040
Huh?

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,800
I want to find him too.

134
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
It's been a long time since we got paid.

135
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
He's disappeared.

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,760
He ran away.

137
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,040
Ah.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey.

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,400
What was this place used for before?

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,280
Did you see that?

141
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,640
Huh?

142
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
These stones in the yard,

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,440
do you know what they're for?

144
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
What for?

145
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,440
They're for land reclamation.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,800
That's a big business.

147
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,520
A big business.

148
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,800
It's huge.

149
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Have you ever seen before

150
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
anyone around A'Kui?

151
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
Do you remember?

152
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,280
Now that you mention it,

153
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,360
when business was good,

154
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,480
he brought back a young girl.

155
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,400
A young girl.

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,720
Just over twenty years old.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Her figure—

158
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,400
she was beautiful.

159
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,680
Girlfriend

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
Such a young girl

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
How could she be Aquai's girlfriend?

162
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Keeps calling her

163
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
Aquai

164
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
That's something

165
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
They seem pretty close

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Hey

167
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Well, he's the boss, he's got money now

168
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,720
Yeah

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,880
Aquai's girlfriend

170
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,720
Our city police conducted surprise inspections at Meili Palace and several other luxury nightclubs

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Forty-seven paid hostesses were caught on the spot

172
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,920
Several entertainment venues were ordered to suspend business for rectification

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,480
Who is it?

174
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,560
Our city police continue to maintain a tough crackdown

175
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
Determined to root out social evils

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,080
To purify the public security environment

177
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,040
Senior Wu Cong

178
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,760
Why are you here?

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,480
Ruirui

180
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,320
I just happened to be passing by your house

181
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,160
So I bought these flowers

182
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,920
Lanlan said we can't accept your gifts

183
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,080
I see

184
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,560
Well, I noticed she hasn't been to school for several days

185
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,480
Is she sick?

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
Lanlan has something going on at home, she's not here

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
If you see her

188
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
Please remember to tell her for me

189
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,600
Just say I need to talk to her

190
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
Don't worry, I'll definitely tell her

191
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,640
And also

192
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,760
Ruirui

193
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Who came?

194
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,760
Who else could it be?

195
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,920
The senior who loves you most

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,840
Wu Cong, of course

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
You're not going to school again

198
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,920
No, I'm not

199
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Alright.

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,280
I'll sign in for you.

201
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,560
Love you the most.

202
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,320
Senior brother has left.

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,080
What is it?

204
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,640
Are you jealous?

205
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah.

206
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm afraid you'll run off with someone else.

207
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,200
Did I say something wrong?

208
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
Don't move.

209
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,880
When did you learn to bandage wounds?

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
You've been gone for almost two years.

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,640
My business.

212
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,320
There’s still a lot you don’t know.

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,800
Regret taking me in?

214
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,240
Let me tell you.

215
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,880
Don’t pretend to be pitiful with me.

216
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
But I’ve come back, haven’t I?

217
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Are you leaving or not?

218
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,640
Liu Kui is a big shot in the underworld.

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
He must have quite a few girlfriends.

220
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,520
Didn’t you check before?

221
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,200
Liu Kui doesn’t have any relatives or friends in Taining.

222
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
No idea where this girlfriend came from.

223
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,320
We can only trace it back to Qingmen District.

224
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Then this number was turned off.

225
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
You’re sure this number belongs to Liu Kui?

226
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,960
Hello?

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,880
Do you remember Dai Qi's husband?

228
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,120
He owns a foreign trade company.

229
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Zhao Zhi.

230
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
The car owner is named Dai Qi.

231
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,080
She's married.

232
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Her husband is the boss of Yiyang Foreign Trade Company.

233
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
His name is Chen Zhengwei.

234
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,520
I think his name has "Yang" in it.

235
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,320
Yiyang Foreign Trade.

236
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
It looks familiar.

237
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,080
But I really don't know his name.

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
His name is Liu Kui.

239
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,240
Four years ago, we held an event here.

240
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
A logistics summit.

241
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,160
All you business owners attended.

242
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,480
He was there too.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,040
The logistics summit.

244
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
Here, it's hot.

245
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,480
Okay, thank you.

246
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Four years ago.

247
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,040
I remember now.

248
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,080
He seems to be in that... um...

249
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
the ore business or something like that.

250
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,040
Yeah.

251
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
He also has some business overseas.

252
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,880
Right, he deals in minerals.

253
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,160
Yeah.

254
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,000
What did you all talk about that day?

255
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,040
And who else was there with you?

256
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
Officer,

257
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,280
we business people

258
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
just go through the motions at these events.

259
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
We exchange business cards,

260
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,880
and that's really all.

261
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,600
Alright.

262
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,440
It's okay, no rush.

263
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Take your time and think carefully.

264
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,280
Anything at all is fine.

265
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
You can tell us anything.

266
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,440
Anything is okay.

267
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Anything.

268
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,160
Is it convenient?

269
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes, it is.

270
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,880
You know what I mean.

271
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,920
Think about it.

272
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,720
Next, let's welcome from Taining City

273
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
the chairman of Yiyang Trading,

274
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,160
Mr. Chen Zhengwei,

275
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,080
to come on stage and give a speech.

276
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,440
Everyone, we're very glad you could join us today.

277
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,320
What are you here for?

278
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,560
Me?

279
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't "me" me.

280
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,200
Why are you here?

281
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,360
For the ribbon-cutting.

282
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,000
Where's the stuff?

283
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
I'll go get it now.

284
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,560
Every year, we...

285
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,600
Do you know where it is?

286
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,760
Everyone gathers together.

287
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
To create a better future together.

288
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,840
Which school are you from?

289
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,240
How old are you?

290
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,640
I'll go get the tools first.

291
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
Wait a moment.

292
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,960
Don't you know the rules?

293
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,480
- In Taining, you need connections. - Don't touch me.

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,440
Who are you?

295
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,040
To create a better future together.

296
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,840
Sorry, big brother.

297
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,360
Ouch.

299
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,640
It hurts.

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,640
Let go.

301
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,360
It's nothing.

302
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,560
What's that girl's name?

303
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,640
Do you still remember?

304
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,000
The girl.

305
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,520
I don't know.

306
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,520
How about this.

307
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
You guys can ask the organizers.

308
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
That would be more straightforward.

309
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,120
Alright.

310
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,320
My clothes are all wet.

311
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,080
Slow down.

312
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,480
Are you cold?

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm not cold.

314
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Lanlan.

315
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Did you really get back together with Liu Kui?

316
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah.

317
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,960
But you were so upset when you broke up before.

318
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,600
And now you forgave him so quickly?

319
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Take me home.

320
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm not like those little boys.

321
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,280
I don't have time to be with you every day.

322
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,720
I know.

323
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,160
You might not see me often.

324
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,360
I know.

325
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,960
Is this still what you want?

326
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,000
I want it.

327
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
But why did he suddenly come back to see you?

328
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
And what about his injuries?

329
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,200
Did you ask him what really happened?

330
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Ruirui.

331
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
I know you're worried about me.

332
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes.

333
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,520
He's much older than me.

334
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,840
And he definitely has a lot of secrets.

335
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,160
But I really don't care about that.

336
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
I just want to be with him.

337
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,880
Why?

338
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,200
I can't really explain it.

339
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,120
But

340
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,160
When you truly fall in love with someone one day,

341
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,760
you'll understand.

342
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,200
This is love.
