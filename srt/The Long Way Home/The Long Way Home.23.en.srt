1
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,040
Every time one is born, one dies.

2
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
You're a jinx.

3
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,360
Do you know that?

4
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,160
You bring misfortune only to our family.

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why don't you just die?

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
What's the point of you being alive?

7
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
My grandson!

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
My grandson!

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,520
Heavens!

10
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,120
Why did you take my grandson away?

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,760
Take this woman away.

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,280
Take this jinx away.

13
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
Please, take this jinx away quickly.

14
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm begging you, heavens.

15
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm begging you.

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,400
Take her away.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Take this jinx away.

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
Heavens!

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,120
Heavens, I'm begging you.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,520
Sorry.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,040
Sorry.

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Looking for a nanny, looking for a nanny.

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
Looking for a nanny.

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Looking for a nanny.

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,920
Looking for a nanny.

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,720
Miss, do you want to be a nanny?

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
Just help take care of a child.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
Just one child.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,160
Why not give it a try?

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Is Xiao Hai dead?

31
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,680
Yes, dead.

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
In the end,

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,800
I couldn't keep a single one.

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,520
Human trafficking.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,160
Home invasion robbery.

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,520
Organizing and leading a criminal gang.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
Inciting minors to commit crimes.

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,400
Intentional injury.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,600
Premeditated murder.

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,760
Zhang Guiping.

41
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,000
You're the best actor I've ever seen among suspects.

42
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,680
Enough.

43
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,240
Start from the first child you abducted.

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
I got married at eighteen.

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,120
I had two children.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,000
One lived for forty days.

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
The other died right after birth.

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,520
A fortune teller said my fate was too strong.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
My life was too tough.

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,000
I had to bring in a child from outside to raise one successfully.

51
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
Only then could I suppress my fate.

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,480
So I went and took one.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
What year was that?

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,440
1982.

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,920
The first time I worked as a nanny,

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
I took A-Lai away.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
This baby is so cute.

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
What's the baby's name?

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
His name is A-Lai.

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,480
A-Lai, A-Lai.

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
Later, I raised four of them.

62
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,600
A-Kui.

63
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,040
Xiao Hai.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
Xiao Jiang.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
And Dongzi.

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
My five tigers.

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,360
I can't understand, I just can't.

68
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,320
Come, give it to me.

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
Go play.

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,160
Help!

71
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
A Kui

72
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Open it and take a look.

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,040
This is what you got in exchange today.

74
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
That lady

75
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
When she got up and ran

76
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
She kept crying and screaming.

77
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,560
Very

78
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
scary.

79
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Don't worry.

80
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
No one will know it was you.

81
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,360
That lady

82
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,200
won't know who you are either.

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,800
Tomorrow, you all go together.

84
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,040
Remember this,

85
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
no one is smarter than you.

86
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,360
You'll understand once you have the skills.

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,360
In this world,

88
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
there's nothing

89
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,640
you can't get.

90
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,320
Got it.

91
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
How did you forge their identities?

92
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Twenty years ago,

93
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
at the county health clinic,

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,000
there was a nurse named Li Xia.

95
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
At that time,

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,080
I paid some money

97
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,360
and bought birth certificates from her.

98
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,080
But later, she died of cancer.

99
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
I never went back after that.

100
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,040
You also planned for Dai Qi to kidnap Li You, didn't you?

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,960
Yes.

102
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,080
I hinted to her

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,160
to kidnap Li You

104
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
so she could take revenge for Wang Ziyan.

105
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,040
This young man is pretty good.

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
That's rare.

107
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,120
Someone like me, I've only ever been a nanny my whole life.

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,880
But I'm a woman too.

109
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,600
That year,

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,440
when my husband passed away,

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,360
it really felt like the sky was falling.

112
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Just think about it,

113
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,880
who could have killed him?

114
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,840
Li You

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,200
That's right.

116
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,160
Let him taste the pain too.

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,040
Wouldn't you feel much better then?

118
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,520
To be honest, about this matter...

119
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
If that's the case,

120
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,320
you caught Dai Qi,

121
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
and I took Mu Mu away.

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Wouldn't that be much more convenient?

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,040
If I hadn't gone to the station today,

124
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
how could you possibly have caught me?

125
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,680
Zhang Guiping

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,480
On the day the task force was formed,

127
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,040
you were destined to be caught.

128
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,760
Speak.

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,200
How many people did you abduct in total?

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,480
A dozen or so.

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,200
I can't remember exactly.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
Those under three were sold.

133
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,880
The older ones

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,720
were kept by my side to work for me.

135
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
Tang Cheng's gold

136
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,680
was also stolen by you, right?

137
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
I worked at the villa for half a year before.

138
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,520
I knew.

139
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,720
That gold

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
wasn't clean anyway.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,200
Giving it to them

142
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,120
wasn't as good as giving it to my kids.

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,880
We can't make a big scene.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,040
After entering the house,

145
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,480
one person controls Tang Cheng and the bodyguard,

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
the other opens the safe.

147
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
Who will go?

148
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Draw lots.

149
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,880
We made it, brother.

150
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll go with you.

151
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,760
You ordered Huang Jiang and Luo Haixiao to commit the robbery.

152
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Then you wanted to kill them to silence them.

153
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Is that right?

154
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,680
Are we lost?

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,520
Where is this place?

156
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,280
Once we cross this mountain,

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,560
we'll reach Wusu.

158
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
Trust me.

159
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,200
Let's go.

160
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,760
What's wrong?

161
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Mom.

162
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
You are all my children.

163
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,840
What my children are thinking,

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,480
would I not know?

165
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Go ahead, say it.

166
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,880
Why are you leaving me?

167
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,200
Is it because of Su Yun, that mute girl?

168
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,120
Mom.

169
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
This has nothing to do with Xiao Jiang.

170
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
It was my decision.

171
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,720
It was all my idea.

172
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,800
It was all my idea.

173
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,480
I'm sorry, Mom.

174
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Since you want to leave,

176
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
then go ahead.

177
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
I'll watch you leave.

178
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,120
A Kui.

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,240
Mom.

180
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Give us a chance.

181
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,840
Xiao Jiang.

182
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Xiao Jiang.

183
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,560
I am their mother.

184
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,040
They're the ones who don't listen.

185
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,320
Then they're not your children.

186
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,920
Yes.

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,600
They never were.

188
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,120
They are.

189
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,320
If it weren't for me,

190
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
they would have died long ago.

191
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
Zhang Guiping.

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,680
In your whole life,

193
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,520
you've never saved anyone.

194
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,960
Every crime you've committed,

195
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,200
every injustice suffered by your victims,

196
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,280
the law will hold you accountable for all of them.

197
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
Nothing will be overlooked.

198
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,880
This child.

199
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,920
Have you seen them?

200
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I don't know them.

201
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,880
Did you look carefully?

202
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Look again.

203
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,120
I said I don't know them.

204
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
Look at this photo.

205
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
I'll ask you again.

206
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,200
In 2005,

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
on May 6th,

208
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,040
in the afternoon,

209
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,320
at the Qing family compound,

210
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,640
this ten-year-old child,

211
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,840
this child,

212
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,520
is yours.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,480
Have you seen them?
