1
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
Qiqi

2
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,840
Yeah

3
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,360
What is this?

4
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,880
Candy

5
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,680
Wrong

6
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,560
What Dad gives you is candy

7
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,760
What others give you could be poison

8
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
Everything you like

9
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,480
could be dangerous to you

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,520
Do you understand?

11
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,200
I understand

12
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Good girl

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Is this dangerous?

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,680
Is this dangerous?

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,440
It's dangerous

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
This is dangerous

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,920
What's dangerous about this?

19
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Dad bought this for you to tie your hair

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
Only I can use it on you

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,040
No one else can

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,360
Okay

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,840
Here

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,320
Thank you

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,960
Let's go home

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,480
You still remember

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,680
This child

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,760
Is yours

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,040
Have you seen her?

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,760
In 2005

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,320
The children I brought in

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
were all sent to Hongwu

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,080
There's a man named Shanchong in Hongwu

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,560
Which two characters?

36
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,120
He likes to take in girls

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
Which two characters?

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
"Shan" as in "big mountain"

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,440
"Chong" as in "taking a shower"

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,400
If I were you

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,480
I wouldn't even bother looking

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
If you don't look

43
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,080
at most, it's just lost

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,360
Look

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,280
All the children

46
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,720
and the women

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
have all been found by you

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,160
There's nothing more to say

49
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
Besides the crime of human trafficking

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,880
there's also all the crimes you participated in

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,080
Confess everything to me right now

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
I ordered someone to blow up Liu Kui's vehicle that was transporting women

53
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,720
Help!

54
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
What happened?

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,960
Our vehicle was blown up

56
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,480
Save whoever you can, quickly

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,760
Deal with the rest as soon as possible

58
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,040
And then?

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,920
Then I framed my mom, saying she ordered the explosion

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,360
I only told you

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
that something happened to the goods

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
How did you know it was blown up?

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,080
I...

64
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,200
I...

65
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
B-boss

66
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,200
It was mom who ordered the explosion

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,480
Mom ordered the explosion

68
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
It was mom

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,960
Mom ordered the explosion

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,360
This way

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
the two of them completely broke off

72
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Liu Kui

73
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,240
I was the one who told Luo Haixiao to go to the nursing home

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
He got his revenge too

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,640
And as for me

76
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I have one less problem

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't move

78
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Drop your weapon

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,280
Liu Kui

80
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,440
Liu Kui

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,240
Liu Kui

82
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,840
Calm down.

83
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,520
Calm down.

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,440
You were the one who led Luo Haixiao and Zhang Guiping to the station.

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,440
Is that so?

86
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
That's right.

87
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
Mom.

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
This is your work badge.

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,520
Be careful.

90
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright, go ahead, don't worry about me.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,880
Go.

92
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm leaving.

93
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Zhang Guiping

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I'm here.

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,720
You want them to turn on each other.

96
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,080
And then take all the gold in the end.

97
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,120
Is that right?

98
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,600
They all have to die.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Do you understand?

100
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,720
What's with all the talk every day?

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Family—Mom loves you all.

102
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Aren't you tired of it?

103
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,120
You were with Zhang Guiping since you were one.

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,520
She cares most about you, her adopted son.

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,320
You're just like the other four.

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,200
Do you hate her too?

107
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,400
What is hate?

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
Do you hate me?

109
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
What are you laughing at?

110
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,560
Why are you laughing?

111
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,320
Feels good.

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
Zhang Guiping isn't the only one who can act.

113
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,640
Wasn't my performance brilliant?

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,080
Wasn't it?

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
This is the child you raised.

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Are you satisfied?

117
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Let me tell you, Zhang Guiping,

118
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,160
I won't give up.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,120
No parent would ever give up.

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
The bus is here.

121
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Don't push. Come on, everyone get off.

122
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Coming.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Come one at a time.

124
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Watch each other, one by one.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
Everyone slow down. Is there anyone else?

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,280
Zhao Zhi is still on the bus. Go call him.

127
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,440
Zhao Zhi.

128
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Zhao Zhi.

129
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,280
Thank you.

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,040
Zhao Zhi.

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,440
They're taking a photo.

132
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,400
Let's go.

133
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,280
Lin Shen

134
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,640
Yeah.

135
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Don't forget the water dispenser.

136
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Right, the water dispenser.

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,560
Just leave it there.

138
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,000
Let me do it.

139
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,680
Move it to the meeting room.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,440
Take it to the meeting room.

141
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,120
Xiao Xu

142
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,920
Give me a hand.

143
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,120
Come here.

144
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,920
Give me one.

145
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't let the girls carry it.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,400
It's fine.

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,120
Go one more time.

148
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Hurry up.

149
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Wait for me on the second floor.

150
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,880
Okay, give me this one.

151
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
Let's go, Xiao Yu.

152
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,160
Wait for me.

153
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm coming.

154
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,120
Shan Chong was caught at Hongwu.

155
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,560
He confessed.

156
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,440
I know.

157
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,520
I have to go there.

158
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,120
You're going alone?

159
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,640
Yeah.

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,280
The task force has already disbanded.

161
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,760
You all have new assignments now.

162
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,080
I'll handle the rest myself.

163
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,680
Alright.

164
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,960
If you need anything, just ask.

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,400
We'll be there whenever you need us.

166
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
How are you doing?

167
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,360
Huh?

168
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
Did your wish come true?

169
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,440
Do you feel like a hero now?

170
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
That's enough, Zhao Zhi.

171
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,440
You're still teasing me about this.

172
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,560
Xin He.

173
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,240
I don't know.

174
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,280
What does it mean to be a hero, anyway?

175
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
But what I do know is,

176
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,400
the only thing we can do

177
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
is to keep going.

178
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't stop.

179
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
We are the last line of defense.

180
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,840
Alright.

181
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,200
It's a deal.

182
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,200
Let's do our best.

183
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,800
The last line of defense.

184
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,400
Take care.

185
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
Xiaogu is a lot like you.

186
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
Oh.

187
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,560
She doesn't like to smile either.

188
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,120
I actually like to smile.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,840
Then smile more.

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,320
Oh.

191
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Master.

192
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
All these years,

193
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,840
I've never blamed you.

194
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,240
Never.

195
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,160
