1
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,840
Driving over this little hill

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
No one knows where I'm going

3
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,840
Stop singing

4
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Your singing is driving me crazy

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid you'll fall asleep

6
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,960
Driving over this small hill,

7
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,240
no one knows where I'm going.

8
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,960
Little truck, hurry up.

9
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,240
- Come home fully loaded.  - Hurry up.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,440
Hurry up.

11
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
Help!

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,120
Watch out!

13
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,960
What happened?

14
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
Our truck got blown up.

15
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
Save whoever you can.

16
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,240
Deal with the rest quickly.

17
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Yes, Kui.

18
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,920
Get to work, get to work.

19
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Things haven't been peaceful lately.

20
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,040
The client is about to turn on us.

21
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm about to return to the country.

22
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
To pick up a new batch of goods.

23
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
You're going back to Taining?

24
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,840
Yeah.

25
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
Mom asked you to go back?

26
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
Yang Dong is out of prison.

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,240
Mom wants me to go get something from him.

28
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,200
It's been hidden for eight years.

29
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,120
It's time to bring it out.

30
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,040
If we can get it back,

31
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,720
things here will get back on track.

32
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,480
Brother.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
How much stuff is there this time?

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,920
Stay out of my business.

35
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,080
Take care of yourself.

36
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,800
But...

37
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,960
Yang Dong was inside for so long.

38
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,000
How can you be sure

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
he didn't tell the police?

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,880
He wouldn't dare.

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,080
I really can't stay in this hellhole any longer.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Boss

43
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,320
I didn't know there was a bomb in the car.

44
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,200
Boss

45
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,680
I really didn't blow up the car.

46
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,200
Go back to the country after handling this.

47
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,640
Understood.

48
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,000
Action.

49
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,960
From last August to this April,

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,240
in five counties and cities in the southeast of our province, including Taining,

51
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,560
eight women and twelve children have gone missing one after another.

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
The impact has been extremely negative.

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,040
The province attaches great importance to this.

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,520
It has been decided to set up a special task force.

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,160
Codename:

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,040
Operation Huntdown.

57
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,280
I will serve as the team leader.

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,240
The deputy team leader will be the division chief from the provincial department.

59
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,560
Comrade Zhao Shi will take the position.

60
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,160
Zhao Shi.

61
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Here.

62
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
Please brief everyone.

63
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,720
On the specific situation.

64
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,520
Yes.

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,320
Everyone,

66
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,280
after several months of investigation,

67
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,960
we have identified

68
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
Ma Li, the owner of the Meiligong Nightclub

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,320
is suspected of being involved in the case.

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
Please take care of us.

71
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
Come and support us often, brothers.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
Sister Lili has been extremely busy lately.

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I don't even know when we'll get paid.

74
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,400
What has she been busy with lately?

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,480
A big client has arrived.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
Through surveillance, it was discovered

77
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,240
that unfamiliar girls frequently come and go at Meiligong.

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,360
But some of the girls

79
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
never return after entering.

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
Brother Wang

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
Why did you come so late?

82
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Seriously.

83
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,800
You didn't even tell me you were coming.

84
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,720
During the course of the operation,

85
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,640
our investigative officers unexpectedly discovered

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,280
the prime suspect we've been tracking for a long time,

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,280
Liu Kui.

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
They have already entered the country from abroad.

89
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,160
This criminal gang is extremely malicious.

90
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
There are introducers among them.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
They carry out abductions.

92
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,160
Smile for the boss.

93
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
Everyone, smile for me.

94
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
There are also intermediaries responsible for the transactions.

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,880
Additionally, there are caretakers, transporters, and so on.

96
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,000
The reason we focused on Liu Kui

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
is because he is one of the gang's

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
transporters.

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,520
You want to cut off this middle route.

100
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes, Director Guo.

101
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,760
No problem.

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
Why are you here?

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
I've been looking for you for a while.

104
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,160
Weren't you investigating?

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm filling in for Sister Zhou today to assist you.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Director Du approved it.

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,120
You were assigned tonight.

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,320
I'll come find you in a bit.

109
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,120
Go, go, go.

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
I'll go later.

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,760
Three sixes.

112
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,480
I'll come in a bit.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
Coming right away.

114
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,000
Everything will go smoothly.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,960
There's a new development.

116
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Room 207.

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
Liu Kui has been spotted.

118
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,840
Liu Kui.

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,360
Are you sure it's him?

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm sure.

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,760
I only saw his profile.

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,720
But I wouldn't mistake him.

123
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,240
I suggest requesting backup and making a direct arrest.

124
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Brother Kui.

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Don't worry.

126
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
My goods

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,440
have always been the best.

128
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,600
Let's talk business.

129
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
I personally selected this batch of goods.

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,200
So, what do you think?

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Satisfied?

132
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
How much is there?

133
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
Same old price.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,960
I'll take it all.

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Thank you, boss.

136
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,320
The main team will arrive in ten minutes.

137
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,440
During these ten minutes,

138
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,640
make sure to stall Liu Kui.

139
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,160
Understood.

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,920
Are you sure the passage has an electronic door?

141
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,440
Yes.

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,960
Alright.

143
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,600
Here's the plan.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
I'll find a way to get inside and stall him.

145
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,760
You go and cut the power.

146
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,040
Lock the electronic door.

147
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,400
Big brother, big sister,

148
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,920
my family has money.

149
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,160
My family has a lot of money.

150
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,520
Whatever you want, my dad will give it to you.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Please, I'm begging you, let me go.

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,920
I promise,

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,480
I won't say a word.

154
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,160
I promise to cooperate.

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,160
Really.

156
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,760
Come out.

157
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,880
Come out.

158
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
I can't sing any songs.

159
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,000
Are you disrespecting Brother Bao?

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
No.

161
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,000
Brother Bao,

162
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,440
Get out.

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Brother Bao, listen to me.

164
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Brother Bao,

165
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
Brother Bao will be back soon.

166
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,560
He'll be back soon.

167
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Sure.

168
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,920
I'll show you how to cooperate.

169
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,080
Get lost.

170
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,320
Lili.

171
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
Not bad.

172
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,600
You didn't invite me to such a nice place?

173
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
Who is this?

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,200
Brought by a premium member.

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,880
Don't be mad.

176
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,760
I'll get him out of here.

177
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,800
Boss, that's my brother.

178
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,400
Get out of the way.

179
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,480
He can afford to play.

180
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,720
But I can't?

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,840
Who are you?

182
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,880
Three.

183
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,880
Two.

184
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,240
One.

185
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,800
Just got the news.

186
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,120
The Xiguan District Public Security Team is conducting a surprise inspection at Meili Palace.

187
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,080
Xiguan District.

188
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,440
Where's Zhao Shi?

189
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Can't reach him right now.

190
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,480
Police inspection.

191
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Everyone in the room, come out.

192
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,080
Please cooperate.

193
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
Come on, people from this side, in the room.

194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,160
This way.

195
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,920
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

196
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Please cooperate.

197
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,000
Come over here, people from this room.

198
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
Come out, come out.

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,040
Come on, please cooperate.

200
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Thank you.

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,160
Everyone, line up.

202
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Face the wall.

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,120
To the restroom.

204
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,520
Everyone is out.

205
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,320
Lili

206
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
Open the door

207
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,400
Put your head out first

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,160
The one who came to this room

209
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,640
Please cooperate

210
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,240
Thank you for coming

211
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,840
Come over here and cooperate with the police inspection

212
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
Police inspection

213
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,360
Ram it for me

214
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Liu Kui

215
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,120
Don't move

216
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,600
Don't move

217
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
Don't move.

218
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,880
Police!

219
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,520
Stop!

220
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
You guys, don't run!

221
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,120
Let go!

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,560
Let go!

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,600
Liu Kui!

224
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,080
Don't move.

225
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Liu Kui!

226
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm a cop too.

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,560
If you're a cop, why are you running?

228
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,560
Gu Da.

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,880
Alright, good work.

230
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,000
Let me go.

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,640
Gu Da.

232
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,320
The boss lady here is way too noisy.

233
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,840
I'll go.

234
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
Check if there's anyone upstairs.

235
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,320
Okay.

236
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,280
Let me go.

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,360
You're the boss, right?

238
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:29,800
Huh?

239
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,280
Do you know who I am?

240
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:31,880
Why did you—

241
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,600
Keep quiet.

242
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,600
What are you being so aggressive for?

243
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Take them to the car.

244
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,920
What are you all doing?

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
Cooperate, please.

246
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,600
Show your ID.

247
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
You guys chatting in the back.

248
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Come on, come on.

249
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,680
We're handling a case.

250
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,000
What are you doing?

251
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Just chatting.

252
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Everyone, please cooperate.

253
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,400
Good, very good.

254
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:47,600
Lin Shen.

255
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:48,920
Yeah?

256
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,320
Gu Da.

257
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,400
What's going on here?

258
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:52,920
Gu Da.

259
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
I just checked.

260
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,640
This place isn't just a simple brothel.

261
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,360
These girls were all drugged.

262
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,800
It probably also involves human trafficking.

263
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,680
Where did those two cars come from?

264
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,600
Did you notify anyone?

265
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,200
I don't know.

266
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,080
I didn't get any notification.

267
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,000
Go provide backup.

268
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
I'll be there in a bit.

269
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Alright.

270
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,520
Resisting arrest.

271
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,640
Assaulting a police officer.

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160
And with your skills,

273
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,560
you wanted to cut the power and escape in the chaos.

274
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,760
I'm telling you, that's an old trick.

275
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,680
I already sent someone to the power room.

276
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Gu Da,

277
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,440
just as you expected,

278
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,160
someone from Meiligong cut the power.

279
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,800
Turn the power back on, quickly.

280
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,760
Okay.

281
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,840
You're the captain?

282
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:53,800
Yes.

283
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,960
Public Security Team, Xiaguan Branch, Taining City Public Security Bureau.

284
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Gu Xinhe.

285
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,080
Gu Xinhe.

286
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,320
That's right, that's me.

287
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,680
Not married.

288
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,400
No girlfriend.

289
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
No siblings either.

290
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,680
Trying to threaten me?

291
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,000
No way.

292
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Liu Kui

293
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,160
Head of Wusu Guolinbei Transport Company

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,520
Taking advantage of his business operations

295
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,200
has been trafficking women and children abroad for a long time

296
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:19,880
What?

297
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,720
In the past three years

298
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,680
dozens of women and children have gone missing

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,040
This person is elusive

300
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,760
and never appears within the country

301
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
But tonight

302
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,880
he happened to return to the country

303
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,680
What did you say?

304
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,720
Dozens of people?

305
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,240
What's his name?

306
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
What do you know?

307
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,680
Do you know

308
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,840
The person you stopped me from catching just now was Liu Kui

309
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,160
Then who are you?

310
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,680
Zhao Shi

311
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,480
Deputy leader of the Operation Hunt task force

312
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,640
I have no wife, no brothers

313
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,280
no sisters

314
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,760
Hello, Director Du

315
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,280
We're conducting a surprise inspection here

316
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,040
We found several women inside who may have been trafficked

317
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
Go take a look

318
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,840
Yes

319
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
Isn't that from the provincial office?

320
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,680
Director Du

321
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,760
He is

322
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,920
He's my team leader
