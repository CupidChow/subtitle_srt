1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
A long, long time ago

2
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,840
there was a fisherman named A Long

3
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,160
who lived in a small village with his wife

4
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
As for A Long

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
he had no money

6
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,200
but he was very hardworking

7
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,720
One time, while fishing in the sea

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,800
he found a beautiful jade pendant

9
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,800
What is a jade pendant?

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,440
A jade pendant is a gemstone

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,320
something very valuable

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,080
He brought the jade pendant home

13
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
His wife told him

14
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,840
he shouldn't take things that belong to others

15
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,160
But he thought his wife was wrong

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
because he wanted to sell the jade pendant

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,680
so they could have a better life

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Aunt Zhang

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,840
Has Mom come back?

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
Go to sleep

21
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
Once Mumu falls asleep

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,880
Mom will come back

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Come, Auntie will tuck you in

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,200
Aunt Gui, this ID number is fake

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,440
The phone number is also out of service

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,240
That's not surprising

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,080
Someone who can hide for twenty years

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,520
won't easily slip up

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Hello

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Okay

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,120
Dai Qi's son is missing

32
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,040
This trick again.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,480
Pause.

34
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,680
Officer.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,520
Officer.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,760
Please save Mumu quickly.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,040
It was my fault last time.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,400
I apologize to you.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,080
Auntie, auntie.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,520
Get up.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,480
Get up, auntie.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Calm down and listen to me.

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,640
I'm begging you.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,920
We will do our best to find the child.

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm sorry to you.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,240
Don't worry.

47
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
The child was probably changed into new clothes right away.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
And has long depended on Zhang Guiping.

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
She won't call for help.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
We can only rely on ourselves now.

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,040
Okay.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
Check all surveillance along the route.

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,880
Set up roadblocks.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
Don't let any car go unchecked.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Understood.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,320
I'll go check the police station first.

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,280
Sorry.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
Are you okay?

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,840
Are you okay?

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you okay?

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister Hui

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't move, let me do it.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,600
It was all an accident.

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,960
Don't move.

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
It was all an accident.

66
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,680
It's fine, it's fine.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,360
It's okay, it's okay.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Take care of yourself.

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
Don't touch my things.

70
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,360
Alright, alright.

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,920
I'll be done soon.

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
Stop bending over.

73
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,880
I told you not to touch my things.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
Qi Chu, are you done or not?

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,120
After this period of investigation,

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,360
we can basically confirm

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,920
that this is a major criminal gang led by Zhang Guiping

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,160
involved in serious crimes.

79
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,480
She has long hidden in society under various identities,

80
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
remaining concealed among the public.

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,800
The children she abducted

82
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,760
have in turn become her accomplices,

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,760
continuing to commit

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,440
abductions,

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,320
murders, and other criminal acts.

86
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
She calls these people the "Five Tigers."

87
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,720
We suspect

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
that in the past six months,

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
the twelve missing

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,840
no,

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,360
thirteen children

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,680
including Dai Qi's son

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,440
are all in the hands of this gang.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
Not only that,

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,760
the Tangcheng gold theft case from eight years ago

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,920
is also strongly suspected to be linked to this gang.

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Among the members,

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
Luo Haixiao

99
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,960
has become the main suspect in the murders of Yang Dong

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,320
and Liu Kui.

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
This Zhang Guiping,

102
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,080
Xu Honglai,

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
and Luo Haixiao

104
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,280
these three people

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
are extremely dangerous.

106
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,400
Now,

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
we have gathered all the evidence of their crimes.

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,800
This time,

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
we must rescue all the children

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
and bring these suspects

111
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,800
to justice.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,760
Yes.

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
Please show your ID card.

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Have your ID card and driver's license ready.

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,280
ID card and driver's license are ready.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,280
Stay close to the car in front.

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,120
Move forward.

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Okay, stop.

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,160
Show your ID card.

120
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,560
Please open your trunk.

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
Routine inspection.

122
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,080
Hello, your documents please.

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,640
Old Zhang.

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Are both bridges up ahead closed?

125
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,120
All of them are closed.

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,680
How many people?

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Twelve people over there.

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
Fifteen people here.

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,840
Alright, keep an eye out.

130
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,440
Um...

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,040
Lin Shen.

132
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Zhang Liang.

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,360
Come here.

134
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
Switch posts.

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:51,920
Okay.

136
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,360
Take a break.

137
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Catch your breath.

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,920
Let me do it.

139
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's go.

140
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,440
Thank you.

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,680
Let's talk.

142
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,640
She's Zhao Zhi's ex-wife.

143
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,200
Luckily, she splashed water on me today.

144
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,160
It made me feel a bit better.

145
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
I think Old Zhao is a sensible person.

146
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,360
The ones doing evil are the traffickers, not you.

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Aren't you overestimating yourself a bit?

148
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,640
Even if he spends just a little energy hating you now,

149
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,360
that's actually a good thing.

150
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
I just don't want him to be like this.

151
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
I don't want his life

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
to be only about work and Qiqi.

153
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:02,960
Then tell me,

154
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,280
what else does he have in his life now?

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
People he needs to protect.

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
We're the same.

157
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,120
Qichu.

158
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,680
Can you pull yourself together?

159
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,200
What are you doing?

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
Don't we have a mission?

161
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,000
Are we doing it or not?

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
Sister.

163
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Sister-in-law.

164
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Let go.

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,040
Where did you go?

166
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,640
Sister-in-law.

167
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
We're on a mission.

168
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm asking him.

169
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
Where did you go?

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
To catch someone.

171
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
To catch a fugitive suspect.

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,840
So Zhao Shi,

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,160
in your heart,

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,800
the case

175
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,160
is always more important than your daughter.

176
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,480
Is that right?

177
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,040
Director Du

178
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
I request permission to take action.

179
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,120
Don't move.

180
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,200
Police!

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
The location where the children are being held

182
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
Do we have any leads at the moment?

183
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,400
According to our analysis,

184
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,000
if they want to smuggle the abducted children,

185
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,760
they definitely have to avoid areas with surveillance

186
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
and checkpoints that inspect large vehicles.

187
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,840
So any highways

188
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
and towns along national roads

189
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,000
are unlikely to be their destination.

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,920
Also, to hide so many children,

191
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,440
first,

192
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
they need to find a concealed place to keep them.

193
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,080
second,

194
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,640
they need a place that is both discreet and convenient for transportation.

195
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,920
So what kind of place meets these conditions?

196
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,440
Where could that be?

197
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,600
Inland river ports.

198
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,520
There are more than a dozen ports around Taining.

199
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,560
Commercial ones,

200
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,160
civilian ones,

201
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,120
and even unused ones.

202
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,200
We still need to narrow down the range.

203
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
We've already sent Qi Chu to investigate.

204
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,000
I believe we'll have results soon.

205
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,720
Director Du,

206
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,960
Qi Chu just sent a message.

207
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,520
Over there.

208
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,800
Search.

209
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,160
Hurry.

210
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,080
Check all the trash cans.

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Look through them.

212
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,200
Here.

213
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
This is where the person was taken.

214
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,960
Check the surrounding surveillance cameras.

215
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,840
Investigate all the vehicles.

216
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,080
Quickly.

217
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,320
Yes.

218
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,520
Hurry.

219
00:13:59,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Yes.

220
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,760
Are you not using your brain?

221
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,480
There.

222
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,400
Go there.

223
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
Come on, bro.

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,320
Where's the food? Where's the food?

225
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,160
He saw a suspicious woman at Meili Palace these past few days.

226
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
Then she was taken to the warehouse.

227
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,720
You weren't seen, right?

228
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,000
Definitely not.

229
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,800
She was alone.

230
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,400
Where am I?

231
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,800
What is this place?
