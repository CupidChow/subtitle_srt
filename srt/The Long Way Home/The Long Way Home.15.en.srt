1
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,400
Brother,

2
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,400
I want to go see Su Yun.

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,280
I don't want to go.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,840
Alright.

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,800
Let's go after finishing with Tang Cheng.

6
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
Xiao Jiang

7
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
Left for you before he passed away

8
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,280
I was just following his instructions

9
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Before Xiao Jiang left

10
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,840
he wanted to come see you

11
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
I was the one who stopped him

12
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,280
I don't blame him, and I don't blame you

13
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,640
Xiao Gu

14
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,880
I watched her grow up

15
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,920
She has never left my side

16
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,720
I need to go away for a few days

17
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
Please take good care of her for me

18
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
What about her mother?

19
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
She doesn't have a mother

20
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,840
But she has a group of fathers

21
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
She grew up in the mine since she was little

22
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,840
Take this gold

23
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,880
Find Old Pei and exchange it for cash

24
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,480
Then use it for yourselves

25
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,800
Say goodbye to her

26
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
No need

27
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
She's mad at me right now

28
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,480
Brother Kui

29
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,320
Sorry about that.

30
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
I drank too much water before coming out.

31
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
Where are we going?

32
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,880
This car is crossing the border tonight.

33
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Brother Lai asked me to take you to the checkpoint.

34
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
Someone over there will take you back to Wusu.

35
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
Why didn't he come himself?

36
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
He went out.

37
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,640
Where did he go?

38
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
How would I know?

39
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
We should get going, right?

40
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,520
No need to look anymore.

41
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,200
It's this one.

42
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,120
Brother Kui, if there's anything, we can talk it out, right?

43
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
This isn't the way to the checkpoint.

44
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,360
What are you trying to do?

45
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,320
I don't know.

46
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
I don't know.

47
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Brother Kui, you...

48
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm telling you—

49
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
It was Aunt Gui.

50
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Aunt Gui told me to bring you out.

51
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
And then...

52
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,560
Figure something out.

53
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,200
Just you?

54
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
Where did A Lai actually go?

55
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
He went to Xiajiang Town.

56
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Xiajiang Town?

57
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,080
Get out of the car.

58
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
I said get out of the car.

59
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
Okay, okay, Brother Kui, I'm getting out now.

60
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,320
Brother Kui.

61
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,280
A Kui, do you really think you can get away?

62
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,240
Mom, do you really have to be so ruthless?

63
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,840
This is what happens when you disobey and betray me.

64
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,080
The nursing home in Xiajiang Town.

65
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,080
Your real mother.

66
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,040
She's been waiting for you there her whole life.

67
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,280
Can you really bear to abandon her and run away on your own?

68
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,240
It's obvious he has single eyelids.

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Then what is this?

70
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,080
It's a shadow, look.

71
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,240
That's a shadow.

72
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,040
What do you think?

73
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,360
Zhao Zhi.

74
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,960
Look.

75
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,080
This should be the Wu Cong case.

76
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,440
The suspect who bought anesthetics.

77
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,640
Lin Shen.

78
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,400
Hey.

79
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Take it and check it out.

80
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,360
Okay.

81
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,280
Big brother.

82
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,080
Don't argue with her.

83
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,440
It's really for your own good.

84
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,000
Where's Mom?

85
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Big brother.

86
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,000
Mom told us to blow it up.

87
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Mom told us to blow it up.

88
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,640
This is what happens when you disobey and betray me.

89
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,640
Your real mother

90
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,560
has been waiting for you there her whole life.

91
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,520
Where did Alai go?

92
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
He went to Xiajiang Town.

93
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
Xiajiang Town.

94
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
The nursing home in Xiajiang Town.

95
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,000
Your real mother

96
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
has been waiting for you there her whole life.

97
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,640
Liu Kui Warrant Hotline.

98
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,320
Hello?

99
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,560
It's me.

100
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
What do you want?

101
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,240
You.

102
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,880
Anhe County.

103
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Xiajiang Town.

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,760
Nursing home.

105
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,240
She's in danger now.

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,800
You need to keep her safe.

107
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Don't play any tricks.

108
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,000
Listen to me.

109
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,920
If you keep her safe,

110
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,960
I'll come to you.

111
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Xiajiang Town Nursing Home.

112
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,000
Hurry.

113
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Let's go.

114
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
Are we lost?

115
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,920
Where are we?

116
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,600
Once we cross this mountain,

117
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,280
we'll be in Wusu.

118
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,040
Trust me.

119
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,680
What's wrong?

120
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,800
Xiao Jiang.

121
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,480
Xiao Jiang.

122
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,160
Xiao Jiang.

123
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,120
Xiao Jiang.

124
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:45,920
Xiao Hai.

125
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,280
Mom knows you've always wanted revenge.

126
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,240
But you can't blame Mom for your brother's death.

127
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,680
A Kui is the real culprit.

128
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
He's now at the nursing home in Xiajiang Town.

129
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,200
This is your last chance.

130
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,720
Son

131
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,080
Have you seen my son?

132
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,520
Why hasn't my son come back?

133
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,160
Son

134
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,800
Liu Kui is a wanted criminal.

135
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,080
He is armed and extremely dangerous.

136
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,720
No matter the reason he turns himself in,

137
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
everyone must remain vigilant.

138
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,440
Copy that, Zhao.

139
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,400
Move out.

140
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,840
Don't move.

141
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Drop your weapon.

142
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,800
The suspect shows no signs of life.

143
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,040
Zhao Zhi

144
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,520
Liu Kui

145
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Zhao Zhi

146
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,640
Liu Kui

147
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,480
Don't touch me.

148
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,280
Liu Kui

149
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,000
Calm down.

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,520
Liu Kui

151
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,240
Calm down.

152
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
He's back.

153
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Medical personnel, please arrive at the scene immediately.

154
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,960
There's also an elderly man here.
