1
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,320
Wu Shouwei said there was a fight here.

2
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,880
But it looks to me like someone cleaned up.

3
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,160
Xiao Zhou.

4
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,720
Did you do the fluorescence test?

5
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,880
Yes, I did.

6
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,320
Zhao Zhi.

7
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,080
Turn off the lights.

8
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Looks like Wu Shouwei was right.

9
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,920
Judging by the sheen and brightness,

10
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
it probably happened within the last two weeks.

11
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Within two weeks?

12
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,640
Yes.

13
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,280
Zhao Zhi, I found something.

14
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Who told you to turn on the lights? Turn them off.

15
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
The timing matches up.

16
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,440
After Yang Dong and Liu Kui left Meili Palace,

17
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,240
they hid at...

18
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,640
Zhang Liang.

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,200
Let's turn on the lights for a moment.

20
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,960
I found an important clue.

21
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
Jian Hospital.

22
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Health Clinic.

23
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,880
It's confirmed.

24
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
That's Yang Dong's hideout.

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
Yang Dong is a bachelor.

26
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,240
Why would he have a receipt from a women and children's clinic?

27
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Hello.

28
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Police.

29
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,160
Please cooperate with us and answer a few questions.

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,480
Take a look at this.

31
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,320
Have you seen this before?

32
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,120
This isn't from our place.

33
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you sure?

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
It says that hospital on it.

35
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,400
Health Clinic.

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,440
I've worked here for five years.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
I've never seen this kind of receipt.

38
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,760
Sister Liu.

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
Can you check if this is from us?

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
This isn't a receipt from our place.

41
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,600
We switched to printed receipts in 2001.

42
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
2001?

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,240
Handwritten ones like this were used over a decade ago.

44
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
They're long gone now.

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:26,960
Oh.

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,960
Alright.

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,440
You're not dead.

48
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
Luo Haixiao.

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
What an awful name.

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,560
I mean,

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,840
your new name.

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
It's really terrible.

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,760
Tell me,

54
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
why did you save me?

55
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,920
I want your gold bars.

56
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,560
Where are they?

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,960
No way.

58
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,120
I've already died once.

59
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,480
You should have figured things out by now.

60
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Where are the gold bars?

61
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
Where's the stuff?

62
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,400
You owe it to me and Xiao Jiang.

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,560
Back then, everything was still handwritten.

64
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,760
What?

65
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Hospital admission records, birth certificates—

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,280
all kinds of records can be forged.

67
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,240
As long as you're willing to pay, you can get anything.

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
It can be done in no time.

69
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
You can become someone else entirely.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,840
So that receipt

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,760
was used by Yang Dong to forge an identity for the child.

72
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,520
That's the police's problem now.

73
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Miss

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,040
Can I borrow a light?

75
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,800
What?

76
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
I actually brought one today.

77
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,680
Let me look for it.

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,360
What's this?

79
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,840
No need.

80
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
It's fine.

81
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,760
Don't bother.

82
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,120
Wait, don't.

83
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
I really did bring it.

84
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,160
I quit, I quit.

85
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,880
I've already quit.

86
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,440
Hurry up and tell me.

87
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
There's news about Yang Dong.

88
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,240
He got a fake ID.

89
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,880
Where is he?

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,640
I'm heading over now.

91
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,600
Don't rush.

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
He's getting the ID, he can't get away.

93
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,200
How can I not be anxious?

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,920
Tell me quickly.

95
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Old Zhao

96
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
When can you ever relax?

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,440
I can't relax.

98
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,480
Don't joke around.

99
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Wait.

100
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
Just this group?

101
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,040
Can they be trusted?

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,480
Where is the stuff?

103
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,720
It's been eight years.

104
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,720
Why does everyone think I took it?

105
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,640
I really don't know.

106
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,680
Liu Kui is also using you.

107
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,280
Because you have the gold bars.

108
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,440
You came to me too.

109
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Liu Kui also came to me.

110
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
Why does everyone think I took it?

111
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Where are the gold bars?

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,280
I really don't know.

113
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,560
I really don't know.

114
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,720
You left it here.

115
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,360
Isn't that right?

116
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
You left it here.

117
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
Or did you leave it here?

118
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,520
I'm not like them.

119
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,520
You all

120
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,640
are all the same.

121
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,640
I'm here because of karma.

122
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Luo Haixiao

123
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
I'll take you to find it.

124
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,560
These were found at the fake ID hideout.

125
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
These are the templates.

126
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,640
This one is Yang Dong.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,520
He changed his name to Zhang Jian.

128
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
Did the person making the fake IDs say anything?

129
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,800
Yeah.

130
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,920
He said Yang Dong didn't get this himself.

131
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
Another man took him to get it.

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,320
And that man, a few months ago,

133
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,000
also got a new ID there.

134
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,800
This is the one.

135
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,440
Luo Haixiao

136
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
The thing is inside.

137
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,920
Why is the water so high?

138
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
It's flood season now.

139
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
See for yourself.

140
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
I can't reach it.

141
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,040
Then when can we get it?

142
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,320
In winter.

143
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,040
Hey, what are you doing?

144
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
Brother Hai

145
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
Why?

146
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,320
Do we have to be ghosts for our whole lives?

147
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,520
Since we've started,

148
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
don't stop.

149
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,120
Definitely don't

150
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
let them go.

151
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,480
Brother

152
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,760
Come on.

153
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,520
Finish me off.

154
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Fourth Brother

155
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,400
You go first.
