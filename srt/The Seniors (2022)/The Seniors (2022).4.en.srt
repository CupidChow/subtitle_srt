1
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:31,765
Hi, everyone! It's your girl, Fifi!

2
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:35,767
I'm back again! And again! And again!

3
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:36,870
I changed my mind.

4
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:41,439
Fifi is back, back,
back in the lower section.

5
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:43,444
You know I have something
that can ruin you.

6
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:44,920
It's me, I'm pregnant.

7
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:47,656
So you not only have a sugar daddy.
You're also pregnant.

8
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:52,119
If you think your drama
will work on me, you're wrong.

9
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:55,889
Babe?

10
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:01,128
You promised me that you'll take care
of my birthday party, right?

11
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,586
Of course. Anything for you.

12
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:06,464
Is my mom there with you?
She's not answering my calls.

13
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:10,596
No. She's not here. Why would she be here?

14
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,888
Let's ride home together.
I want to make sure you get home.

15
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,349
Fifi, I'll let you know. Promise.
Don't worry about me.

16
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,268
But Diana, I don't have money anymore.

17
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,791
They say...

18
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,851
no one is perfect.

19
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,754
I'm as perfect as the lighting here.

20
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,464
Sunkissed!

21
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:32,359
That's why we're always stressed...

22
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,468
Let's try dewy.

23
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,012
Disappointed...

24
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:36,876
And losing it.

25
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,267
Because we expect perfection in everything.

26
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:41,593
Are we ready, Fifi?

27
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:42,744
- Yes!
- Rolling!

28
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,055
Okay. Hi, guys!

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello to our 24 million—

30
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:53,739
So, guys. Sorry it's quite noisy here.

31
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,480
Excuse me!

32
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:59,966
Is that more important
than my Facebook live?

33
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:03,584
A beautiful person is never perfect.

34
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,292
Who knows, maybe her feet stink.

35
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:08,478
Okay, I like this question.
There's a lot! In fairness!

36
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,547
But this question is quite good.

37
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,975
How do you stay gay

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,334
and fit

39
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,528
at the same time?

40
00:02:16,528 --> 00:02:18,722
#gayspiration

41
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,548
#goals

42
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,784
Right! How do you stay fit
and be gay at the same time?

43
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:24,227
Hi guys—

44
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,181
The connection is spotty.

45
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:29,182
Kinda choppy too.

46
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,485
We have to go. Bye! Bye, guys!

47
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:32,540
Bye!

48
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:34,029
Oh my god!

49
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,430
What was that?

50
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,911
The world isn't ready to know
about my being gay.

51
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:42,871
In your case? You're not out yet?

52
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,665
Well, not to everyone.

53
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,999
So you mean?

54
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,501
You're not yet out to your dad?

55
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:48,710
But you guys are close.

56
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,820
Yes. Shout it louder. Go!

57
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,130
Why?

58
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,802
Of course, not everyone knows that—

59
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:57,886
Imagine this.

60
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,454
His only son is—

61
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,114
is—

62
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:06,286
His one and only son is gay, homo, a fag!

63
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:09,622
You know how #boomers are.

64
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:11,750
They're also alpha males!

65
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:12,818
You get it?

66
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:16,129
I guess. I guess we have our own secrets.

67
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,465
It's getting noisy here.
Let's go somewhere else.

68
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,283
- How about your place?
- No. No way.

69
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,635
- Come on.
- Why? Are you hiding something?

70
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,597
Can we just continue
the Facebook live, please?

71
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,390
We still have challenges,
remember? Let’s go.

72
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,208
Okay.

73
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:29,768
Truth or dare?

74
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:33,063
- Why did you move here to Pacaque?
- That’s not part—

75
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:35,273
Spill!

76
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:36,550
Girl,

77
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,802
your mom doesn't know you’re preggy.

78
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,530
Wow.

79
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:45,867
Say it a lot louder, Fifi.
So everyone can hear it too.

80
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,294
She doesn’t know, right?

81
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,338
Okay.

82
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:54,443
Well...

83
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,710
The truth is,

84
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:04,177
We moved here

85
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,582
after knowing that my dad
has another family

86
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,184
and...

87
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,403
he chose them

88
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,424
over us even if we're his legal family.

89
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,943
And...

90
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:23,789
my grandpa, the one you thought
was my sugar daddy,

91
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:26,616
Sorry about that.

92
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,081
I'm his favorite grandchild.

93
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,580
So even though we're far apart,

94
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,883
he still visits me here.

95
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,837
And that's why it is a secret

96
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:42,432
because if my mom finds out,
she won't forgive me

97
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:45,977
for still seeing my dad's family.

98
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,720
What the fuck, girl?

99
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,732
If my life is like a Boys Love series,

100
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,694
yours is like a drama series.

101
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:56,071
But, for real,

102
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,906
are you okay?

103
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,150
Yeah.

104
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:00,867
Really?

105
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,318
Yeah, I mean...

106
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,655
You eventually got used to it.

107
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:09,242
I can't do anything about it, right?

108
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,269
Shit.

109
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,464
You've been through so much
but you don't look like it.

110
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,250
Teach me, senpai.

111
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,653
Teach me how.

112
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:24,692
Teach me to accept that I'm not in the
star section anymore. Teach me how.

113
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:27,644
Please.

114
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,603
SIR DAX: I'LL JUST BE AT SCHOOL
THIS AFTERNOON.

115
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:12,907
Who's there?

116
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:19,622
Who's there?

117
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,970
Students aren't allowed here at night.

118
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:39,863
Ms. Santos?

119
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:43,289
What are you doing here?

120
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:45,490
It's late.

121
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,619
Do your parents know you're here?

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,389
What's that?

123
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,808
- Diana, delete it.
- Nope.

124
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:58,661
- Delete it or I will fail in my class.
- Try me, sir.

125
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,191
Your name and your reputation
is on the line.

126
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,760
As well as the woman you
were with a while ago.

127
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,894
What do you want, Diana?

128
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:11,850
Do you want to pass all my exams?

129
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:15,061
Exemption from class? Just tell me.

130
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:20,058
I want you to put Fifi in the star section.

131
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:21,292
Then.

132
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:22,711
Just then.

133
00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:24,529
I'll keep your secret.

134
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,881
- What?
- You heard me.

135
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:30,624
Next week. Monday.

136
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:33,788
I want Fifi beside me in class by then.

137
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,050
He wil be under your class

138
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:40,787
and we'll graduate together
from the star section.

139
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,959
Diana, you don't know what you're saying.
It's not that easy.

140
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,279
Alright. Then in just one click,

141
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,401
the whole world will know
your dirty little secret.

142
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,472
#Cancelled

143
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:08,773
Oh my gosh.

144
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,234
Girl, thank you!

145
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:14,179
Fifi, I did what I did
because you deserve it.

146
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,823
You don't have to suck up to me.

147
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,231
- No, for real.
- You know what, just tell me.

148
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,452
So I would know
if I should feel guilty or not.

149
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,413
- No, this is for real. You deserve it.
- Really?

150
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,789
- Like, really?
- Yes!

151
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,871
Fifi is our classmate now.

152
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,840
Oh, really?

153
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:45,059
That's cute! Well at least,

154
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,104
- The Certifieds are now complete!
- Certifieds?!

155
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,273
Certifieds, your butt!

156
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:52,550
And cute? Excuse me

157
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:53,968
but are you pretty like me?

158
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,221
Smart like me? Tell me!

159
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,615
You're neither, so shut up!

160
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,034
And why are you so mad?
What did I ever do to you?

161
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:06,763
Aren't you happy now that we're complete?
Why can't you just move on? Or maybe...

162
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:10,042
because you still can't accept the fact
that you're not good enough

163
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,736
for the star section.

164
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:14,479
Well,

165
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,507
sorry to tell you this.

166
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:20,219
From now on,
we are not part of this narrative.

167
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,022
Only the both of you are The Certifieds.
The both of us are...

168
00:10:23,514 --> 00:10:24,557
What are we?

169
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,394
- We are...
- The...

170
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,396
We’re the...

171
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,648
- The Verifieds?
- Verifieds! Yes. Correct. That's right!

172
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,650
- That's so cool, yeah?
- Super!

173
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,070
- Wow! You want to get into trouble?
- Yes!

174
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,740
You want war?

175
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,116
- I want war.
- No, you dont.

176
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,977
I'll give you war.

177
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:47,830
Schedule a Facebook event!
Set it! Schedule it!

178
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,333
- We'll be there.
- Why don't you do it? You thought of it.

179
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,792
- Girl!
- You do it!

180
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:53,961
Let them be.

181
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,133
By the way, guys.
Just check our Facebook chat group.

182
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,594
for the invitation to my 18th birthday.

183
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,847
Oh my, so pretty.
You are just so gorgeous here.

184
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,583
- Thank you.
- Huh?

185
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,808
I'll go!

186
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:09,018
My battery's dead.

187
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,044
You going?

188
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,670
Am I invited?

189
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,426
No, you're not.

190
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,943
Hey, why am I not invited?
Where's my invite?

191
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:20,446
Since there are boys from a private school,

192
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,448
oily-faced people aren't allowed!

193
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,018
Oh really? Fuck you!

194
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,970
- Fuck you, too!
- Fifi, that’s enough.

195
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:31,457
Class, please pass your assignments.

196
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,128
- Yes!
- Oh!

197
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,865
- Sir Dax!
- Yes?

198
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:46,523
Isn't it too late to add
Rafael in the star section?

199
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,807
Rafael?!

200
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,183
Excuse me!

201
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:50,726
Rafael is dead.

202
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,978
Fifi is in.

203
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,689
Hey, Jennifer, wake up!

204
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,049
This is a public school.

205
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:59,026
The government
never expedites matters in this school.

206
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,153
Excuse me.

207
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,081
This is the star section.

208
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,750
- Star section!
- I mean...

209
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:09,161
Students from the star section
think quicker.

210
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,998
We have advanced lessons.
Unlike those who came from

211
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,718
the regular section, they're late.

212
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,879
I'm just really concerned for Rafael.

213
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:23,617
It might be difficult for him to catch up.
Isn't he at the bottom of the class?

214
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:30,016
But that's not up to me, Jennifer.

215
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,317
That's up to Fifi.

216
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,853
Yes, correct. It's up to me.

217
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,688
And, sorry,

218
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:39,066
thank you for you concern. I’m good!
I’m good here, sir. I’m good.

219
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:41,611
I remember, Sir Dax.

220
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:44,138
Our textbooks are only enough

221
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,906
for 18 students, right?

222
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:48,977
That's why you dropped him
from this section, right?

223
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,621
I pity the student
who will lose a textbook

224
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,749
just to accommodate Rafael.

225
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:55,900
Actually...

226
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:59,487
having 18 students in class doesn't mean

227
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,138
all of you will have textbooks.

228
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:03,090
We still lack a few books.

229
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:06,802
I'm not sure if our request reaches
the regional office

230
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,429
since we're far from the city.

231
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,431
But that's not news to us.

232
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,517
In the meantime, you will learn
to share your textbooks.

233
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,728
Exactly! I knew it.

234
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,982
Anyway, class, I want you to check
your physics textbooks.

235
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:23,861
And please answer activities 23-28. Okay?

236
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,489
It will be done by group of three.

237
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:28,666
Deadline is tomorrow.

238
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:31,711
Sir Dax,

239
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:34,246
like what I said earlier,

240
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,383
there is one student without a groupmate.

241
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,089
Then group yourselves into four.

242
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,115
What?

243
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,133
Sir, but that's not fair!

244
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,534
Actually, sir.

245
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,329
I'm good with it.

246
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:52,264
More brains will actually work.
Only if the others do work.

247
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,432
But I'm okay. I'm good with it.

248
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,517
Okay! Good.

249
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:56,936
I'll just go back to
the faculty room, okay?

250
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,064
And see you later on
our teacher's day event!

251
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,024
- Bye, class.
- Okay, sir.

252
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:04,443
Bye, sir!

253
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,491
One, two.

254
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:08,531
Are we friends with them again?

255
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,183
I'm so confused.

256
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,244
Keep up, you dumbass.

257
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,956
Fix this. It's drooping.

258
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:23,045
ANTON: Mom and Dad fought again.
Can you send nudes to make me happy?

259
00:14:23,546 --> 00:14:24,839
NICOLE: Later in the restroom.

260
00:14:25,256 --> 00:14:28,884
- ANTON: Are you wearing a skirt?
- Hey, Marie, are you just gonna sit there?

261
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,890
NICOLE: Yup.
Our usual public school uniform.

262
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,485
This isn't Pacaque standard.

263
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,245
Mico.

264
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,522
- ANTON: Then we can go at it right away?
- Mico, is the mic ready?

265
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,858
It's okay? You sure?

266
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,026
NICOLE: You're so naughty.

267
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,013
- Chico, where are you taking the plants?
- At the side.

268
00:14:49,196 --> 00:14:52,375
There's a ton at that spot.
Take it back. It works better there.

269
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:58,748
ANTON: YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY.
I WANNA DO IT ALREADY.

270
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:05,379
NICOLE: OMG... I said after my birthday.

271
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,715
Can't you all look presentable for once?

272
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,426
Aren't you a star student?

273
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,765
Anton! My baby!

274
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:19,252
Have you seen them?

275
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,117
Hey, are you listening?

276
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,360
- Yeah, super.
- Oh, really?

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,554
What did I just say?

278
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,261
Rose pink
is Ma'am Jemma's favorite color?

279
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:35,451
Oh, you're so amazing!

280
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,453
Amazingly dumb!

281
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,748
You're lucky you're pretty.
Look for Fifi and Diana!

282
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,134
- They're not here.
- Alright.

283
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,736
- Nicole!
- What?

284
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,797
- Door’s this way.
- Oh, sorry.

285
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,232
Sorry, sorry. It's Anton's fault.

286
00:15:50,257 --> 00:15:53,995
Your brain has nothing but boys.

287
00:15:54,595 --> 00:15:57,473
Good afternoon to our dearest principal,

288
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,818
dearest teachers, and my fellow students.

289
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:03,270
Today, we have gathered here

290
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:07,158
to honor the hardwork of
our loving teachers.

291
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:17,952
I was lucky to be raised by godparents

292
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:19,912
who happened to be my teachers as well.

293
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,314
But...

294
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,676
the teacher I am most grateful for

295
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,128
is also my mother.

296
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,297
Ma'am Jemma Dimaculangan.

297
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:37,179
Ma,

298
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,640
thank you for inspiring us.

299
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,878
Thank you for the patience you give

300
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:48,983
and there is no one in this world
that I look up to except for you.

301
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,151
You are a mother

302
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,319
a teacher,

303
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,956
and you are unstopabble.

304
00:16:55,197 --> 00:17:00,128
I can't ask for anything in
this universe other than...

305
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,751
You are my pride and joy, Ma.

306
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,718
Thank you for being the best teacher
in the whole world.

307
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:18,304
And to all the teachers, thank you
so much for your patience.

308
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,973
We have gifts for you.

309
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:22,442
Classmates.

310
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:28,647
Give your roses to your favorite teacher
and the teacher you're most grateful for.

311
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:40,409
Sir Dax...

312
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,494
- Is this for me?
- Yes. Happy Teacher's day!

313
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,438
Happy Teacher's day! Be a good student.

314
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,212
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too. That speech was amazing.

315
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:54,757
Of course. It's for you.

316
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,940
Congrats to you, Jennifer!

317
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,101
Mrs. Dimaculangan,
congrats to your daughter!

318
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,088
Next time, don't give me flowers

319
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:10,940
because it’s not manly.

320
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,359
- Flowers might look well with Sir Dax.
- That's okay.

321
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,027
Maybe Ma'am Jemma would like some.

322
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,155
I better go. The superintendent
is waiting for me.

323
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:22,043
- Roses are alright even for men.
- It's Nicole! Nicole bought it earlier.

324
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:27,039
Hello, mic check. Mic check.

325
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,542
Everyone, attention here please.

326
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:32,544
Thank you. Okay.

327
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:37,841
So, before the day ends we would like
to ask our lovely teachers to please stay

328
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,993
because we have a special...

329
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,304
- Announcement.
- And presentation.

330
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,898
- Yes.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

331
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,849
Thank you, twin sister. Hold this for me.

332
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:49,520
Hey y'all! What's up, what's up?!

333
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,582
- And of course, we have our own stunt too!
- Yes!

334
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:59,680
So with that, if we call your name,
please come forward for your award.

335
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,932
And here it is,

336
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:05,052
the ultimate awards to recognize
our own teachers.

337
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,854
But instead of us, it will be the teachers.

338
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,190
Without further ado.
What's the first award?

339
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:09,796
Here!

340
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,150
Here's the award!

341
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:13,761
Photocopy queen award goes to...

342
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:16,572
Ms. Lourdes Cabral!

343
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,383
Congrats!

344
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:22,136
Endless photocopying it is.

345
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:24,263
Ms. Cabral, this is your award.

346
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,806
- There!
- Yes!

347
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,643
They're so fun!

348
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:33,230
But we also don't have books
so we rely on photocopies.

349
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,400
And you have the cheapest prints,
so we support local!

350
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,219
Congrats, Ms. Cabral!

351
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,029
Let’s take a picture.

352
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:45,367
Didn't I tell you to find them?!

353
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,244
This is your fault.

354
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:50,456
Alright, thank you! Go back to your seat.

355
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,483
The next award is...

356
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,627
Lips of Love award.

357
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,322
Who do you think will get this award?

358
00:19:58,616 --> 00:20:00,783
Ma'am Jemma!

359
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:02,384
Are you guys sure?

360
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:03,761
Yes!

361
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:05,763
Okay, this award is for...

362
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:09,198
Ma'am Jemma Dimaculangan!

363
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,227
- Who? Me?
- Yes!

364
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:16,523
- It's me! Hold this for me.
- Ma'am Jemma! Ma'am Jemma!

365
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,400
- Yay!
- Ma'am Jemma! Ma'am Jemma!

366
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,929
Lips of Love awarded by you.

367
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,073
By you!

368
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,741
Because Ms. Jemma is one of a kind

369
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,395
Her ASMR-like voice
can calm us down with her words

370
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,981
and motherly method of teaching.

371
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,034
Oh to have her as your mother!

372
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,176
Don't you just wish all moms are like that?

373
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:40,255
Alright. Let's take a picture.

374
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:42,132
Thank you for this award.

375
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:43,567
Is that how you do a heart?

376
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:46,370
Congratulations!

377
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,348
- Congrats!
- Thank you!

378
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,433
- Oh, we have snacks!
- Yes, please dig in.

379
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:52,768
Thank you!

380
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,613
Alright. The last but not the least.
The last award is...

381
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,735
The Panty-Dropping award.

382
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:05,280
Oh my god. Do I even need
to say who this is for?

383
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,183
No!

384
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,703
This award is for Sir...

385
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,645
Dax!

386
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,605
Sir?

387
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,914
Dax!

388
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:17,543
Yes, Sir Dax. But don't forget the Tee—

389
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,753
Ten!

390
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,214
Sir Dax, this award is for you.

391
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,591
Oh my gosh.

392
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,702
- Oh my gosh.
- Go, Sir Dax!

393
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:28,688
- Go, Sir Dax!
- Oh my gosh.

394
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,690
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

395
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,673
There, Sir Dax!

396
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,085
Congratulations!

397
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,838
This is your award.

398
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,356
Look at my award!

399
00:21:39,356 --> 00:21:41,066
Lips of Love award.

400
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:45,237
- We took a pouty-lip selfie.
- Because you know how much I love you.

401
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,639
You know how much we love you.

402
00:21:46,664 --> 00:21:49,167
And you know how big—

403
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,326
how big our love for you is.

404
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:53,287
- Congratulations!
- Thank you. Thank you.

405
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,080
Thank you, Sir Dax!

406
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,524
- Thank you, class. Thank you.
- Let’s take a picture!

407
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,025
Let’s take a picture!

408
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,803
Closer! Closer!

409
00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:04,165
Yes! Thank you!

410
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:08,051
JENNIFER: Ma, are we going home together?
We're just cleaning up.

411
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:11,388
MAMA: You can go first, dear.
We still have a meeting.

412
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:14,183
JENNIFER: You sure, Ma?
I can wait for you.

413
00:22:14,183 --> 00:22:17,603
MAMA: YES. We might finish late too.

414
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,522
JENNIFER: Okay, Ma. Love you!

415
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,278
We don't have to wait
for Mom later going home.

416
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,230
Will Anton pick you up?

417
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:38,065
Because...

418
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:39,984
I have a favor to ask.

419
00:22:40,257 --> 00:22:41,402
What is it?

420
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,404
Oh, it's nothing.

421
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:45,447
Just a surprise.

422
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:49,718
Diana, it's your turn.

423
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,512
- Your turn to be trash.
- Have you looked at yourself?

424
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:58,961
Tell Diana and Fifi we'll do
our assignment at my house.

425
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,504
There's an assignment?

426
00:23:01,198 --> 00:23:02,214
Yes.

427
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,374
Wait a minute.

428
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,111
- Now, go!
- Hold on. Let me just...

429
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,270
Diana. Fifi.

430
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:15,519
We'll work on the assignment at Jennifer's.

431
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:16,937
We'll see you.

432
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:20,482
I already told them.

433
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:31,343
Babe!

434
00:23:32,636 --> 00:23:34,388
Babe!

435
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,497
Hey, babe!

436
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:37,416
Hi!

437
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:40,130
Do you have it?

438
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:41,227
It's in my bag.

439
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:42,104
G?

440
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:42,896
- So? Let's go?
- Love you!

441
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,048
- G! G!

442
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,232
Hey! Wait, hold on one sec.

443
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:46,650
Away. Go Away!

444
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,010
You can't ride with us.

445
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,362
Let's just see each other at my place.

446
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,822
- You can walk there.
- What?

447
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,265
They won't fit right?

448
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:55,158
Yeah, there's too much stuff.

449
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:56,994
Too much stuff? How about me and Diana?

450
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,620
Backseat's crowded already.

451
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,721
You're not allowed here.

452
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,373
You'll stink up the car.

453
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,666
- There’s still so much space!
- Let's go. Let's go.

454
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,169
- There's still some seats!
- You're a selfish bitch, Jennifer!

455
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:07,045
Thank you!

456
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,571
We can all fit there!

457
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,934
Bye!

458
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:15,829
Let’s go!

459
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,586
- Do you have money?
- What?

460
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,213
Money?

461
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:26,674
I spent all of it.

462
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,968
It all went to buying snacks
for the teachers.

463
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,511
That makes the two of us.

464
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:33,514
Is Jennifer's place just close by?

465
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,765
- Let's walk.
- No.

466
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:37,267
No, don't walk. You're pregnant, remember?

467
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,103
You're pregnant, remember?

468
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:41,955
And the place is far. Something might
happen to you. Maybe—

469
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:44,858
Fifi, I'm preggy
not amputated, okay? Let's go.

470
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,385
Okay. Let's go.

471
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:57,413
Oh my gosh. You guys are such slow walkers.

472
00:24:58,487 --> 00:24:59,498
Here.

473
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,500
Both of you do the assignment.

474
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:03,585
This is my house.
That's my part for the project.

475
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:04,998
As you can see,

476
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:10,259
Jennifer is that one groupmate who will
volunteer to print your project.

477
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:12,803
And she thinks that's enough.

478
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,381
Certified burden to her groupmates.

479
00:25:16,406 --> 00:25:18,116
You're being too much, Jennifer!

480
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,101
My house, my rules.

481
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,005
This is my textbook. And you?
What have you got?

482
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:25,357
What about Nicole?
What's her role here?

483
00:25:26,106 --> 00:25:27,468
Stand up, girl.

484
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,071
She's pretty.

485
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,531
And you're not.

486
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:34,366
That's her role.

487
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,435
Thanks, girl.

488
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:40,606
Get the juice.

489
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,953
Poor kids. They must be so tired.

490
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:44,918
Juice.

491
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:47,963
Twin sister...

492
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:50,174
You okay?

493
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,804
I'll just get some fresh air.
I can't breathe.

494
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:54,997
I'll be back. Okay?

495
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:56,263
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

496
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,182
As they say,

497
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,726
no one is perfect.

498
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,938
That's why there's Ctrl+Z

499
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,399
so if you make a mistake,

500
00:26:08,598 --> 00:26:11,320
you can just erase and start over again.

501
00:26:12,503 --> 00:26:13,697
Super easy.

502
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,620
This is for you and Diana.
It looks like the both of you are parched.

503
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,956
Rightly so!
You made us walk that far.

504
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:39,947
We were so tired.

505
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:43,435
We could all fit in the car.
You bitches are just selfish!

506
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:48,732
I'll take this too.

507
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,609
Preggies can be picky.

508
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:55,931
- Who's preggy?
- Who's preggy?

509
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:58,700
What?

510
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:03,522
It’s—

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,460
It’s Mr. Kanor's mistress.

512
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:09,069
She's pregnant. Haven't you heard?

513
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:10,529
Dumbass.

514
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,909
But what if Ctrl+Z isn't working anymore?

515
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,128
Maybe it's time to restart?

516
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:40,801
Can we still erase a mistake
that's already been stitched?

517
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,204
Who’s there?

518
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:00,846
JD?

519
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:02,055
Jennifer.

520
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,290
- Dimaculangan.
- Give me it.

521
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,100
I just don't want you to end up like me.

522
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,435
- Like what?
- Be pregnant by the wrong person. Okay?

523
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,437
You're pregnant?

524
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,189
I caught them last night.

525
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:11,565
Jennifer?

526
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,300
Jennifer, are you there?

527
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,303
Yes, sir! We'll come back with
no cuts and bruises!

528
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,905
Please clean him up, too.

529
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:20,657
They say

530
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,201
if you love someone,

531
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:23,827
you want them to be happy.

532
00:28:23,865 --> 00:28:25,162
Yes.

533
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:27,372
Then make this sad boy happy.
