1
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,737
JD?

2
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,614
I just don't want you to end up like me.

3
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,240
Like what?

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,950
Knocked up by the wrong person.

5
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,701
I caught them the other night.

6
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,704
Sooner or later,
the whole school will find out.

7
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,856
It's all my fault.

8
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,834
- You can stay with us.
- If it’s okay.

9
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,153
I just really don't want to go home yet.

10
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:47,239
I appreciate that you
asked me in person, Jeff.

11
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,801
I'll make sure
to take good care of him, sir.

12
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:51,843
Carps?

13
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,012
What's carps?

14
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,454
Carpet, maybe?

15
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,557
Are we gonna have
sex on a carpet?

16
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:59,126
Just make sure you won't regret it.

17
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,211
That's it?

18
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,530
WE HAVEN’T TALKED FOR A WEEK.
WHAT HAPPENED?

19
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,410
BABE? WHY ARE
YOU NOT REPLYING?

20
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,873
TODAY’S MY BIRTHDAY.
YOU PROMISED A BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR ME.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,963
DID YOU JUST USE ME FOR SEX?

22
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,561
Expectation

23
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,645
versus

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,713
reality.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,927
Two different things that
we force to be the same.

26
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,238
Girl,

27
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,139
that’s enough.

28
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,159
It's been a week. Enough.

29
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:00,145
How can I move on?

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,748
It's as if nothing happened.

31
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:04,792
Five years.

32
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:08,070
For five years,
I imagined my first sex to be magical

33
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:11,490
only for him to finish in five minutes.

34
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:13,592
His dick is merely an inch.

35
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,760
That's what you get

36
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:18,539
from reading pocketbooks
and Wattpad stories.

37
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,848
Stop crying.

38
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,625
But in real life,

39
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:24,624
when expectations don't match reality...

40
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,338
Lord,

41
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,231
why You gotta be like that?

42
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,442
Don't text him anymore.

43
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,609
Stop being stubborn.

44
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:32,862
What are you doing?

45
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,797
Let me be.

46
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,616
He's been ignoring you for a week.

47
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,687
Can you leave me alone for now?

48
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:43,844
Are you sure?

49
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,082
Yes.

50
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:46,900
Let me be.

51
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,535
Hey!

52
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,620
You diva!

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,913
Your mom's looking for you.

54
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:25,706
You’re such a scene stealer.

55
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,891
Aren't you going to ask
how I've been first?

56
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,318
Oh wow.

57
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,670
Did you ask how my tummy was last week?

58
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:32,713
Bitch!

59
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:33,964
You better come here

60
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,324
so I can pull your hair out.

61
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,175
Look, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:38,093
Sorry?

63
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,453
Don't try me.

64
00:03:39,855 --> 00:03:42,180
Fi, can we not fight?

65
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,165
And why?

66
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,016
I'm not the one who started this.

67
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:48,312
I didn't call to apologize.

68
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,480
See?

69
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:52,399
You even have a hidden agenda.

70
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,859
I said I'm sorry.

71
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,737
Can’t you see? Karma’s coming back for me.

72
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,708
Really?

73
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:00,807
Okay, what's wrong?

74
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:03,034
It's Nicole,

75
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:03,813
she suddenly—

76
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:06,063
Hello?

77
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,231
Girl?

78
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,292
Hello?

79
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,736
There. Yes, I can hear you.

80
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:15,005
Hello? I said it’s about Nicole.

81
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,757
Can you hear me?

82
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,049
Hello?

83
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,468
Can we get to this conversation today?

84
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,595
Hello, Fi. I can't hear you. Hey.

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,471
There, better.

86
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,763
Do you hear me now?

87
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:25,331
Yup. So, what happened to Nic—

88
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,463
Fuck.

89
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,858
What a time to run out of phone credit.

90
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:37,736
Dear?

91
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,047
- Mom?
- Come on, dear, let’s go.

92
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:41,449
Mom. Wait a minute.

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,203
Dear, what’s taking you so long?

94
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,247
I'm almost done, Mom. Hold on!

95
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:52,693
Remember, we must always
put the Lord God first.

96
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,338
Finish your business later!

97
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay, okay!

98
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:09,601
Hello?

99
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,685
Hello, girl!

100
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:12,145
Where you at?

101
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,089
Here at home. Why?

102
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,399
Girl, I've been texting you.

103
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:17,818
You ain't replying, sis.

104
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:19,445
Sorry, I just had a problem.

105
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:20,987
Why? What do you need?

106
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,013
Problem?

107
00:05:23,392 --> 00:05:24,282
What is it?

108
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:26,910
Nothing. It's nothing.

109
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,496
Come on, tell me.

110
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,724
I just keep on throwing up.

111
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,809
I think it comes with the pregnancy?

112
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,417
Well.

113
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,193
How would I know?

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,154
I don't have a uterus.

115
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,197
And you really ask me of all people.

116
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,258
So why did you call, Fi?

117
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,176
It’s because—

118
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,760
of our BFF.

119
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:45,220
She needs help.

120
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,263
BFF?

121
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:47,722
Yes, who else?

122
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,666
The meanest bitch, Jennifer.

123
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:52,352
Oh why? Did she go home already?

124
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,813
She didn't say. But—

125
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,091
what she did say

126
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:58,108
is that Nicole...

127
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,137
Then? That's it?

128
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,030
That's it.

129
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:04,948
That's it?

130
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,684
That's it, girl. Our call got cut off.

131
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:10,454
So are we gonna help them?

132
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,247
Do they deserve our help?

133
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,857
Diana Marie!

134
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,001
Uh-oh, girl.

135
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,545
Is your mom mad?

136
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,463
It’s nothing. Don't mind her.

137
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,823
Alright, let's just figure out
what Jennifer needs.

138
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,284
- Perfect.
- Hey, Raphael.

139
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:25,927
What was that?

140
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,095
Ah, Pops.

141
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:28,239
Pops.

142
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,097
That’s nothing.

143
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,558
It's a new move from coach.

144
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,959
Part of our drills.

145
00:06:32,984 --> 00:06:34,561
We steal the ball from the air.

146
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,230
It's one of the moves of Shaquille O...

147
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,357
Shaquille O'Bryant.

148
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,676
It’s Shaquille O'Bryant’s signature move.

149
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,071
- Alright, clean this place up.
- Really?

150
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:46,197
Are you for real?

151
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,307
Really, really.

152
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:48,617
How about you?

153
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:51,102
You still haven't told
your mom you're pregnant.

154
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,021
So I think, it's a tie.

155
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,969
See you later then?

156
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,401
Yeah, sure.

157
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:05,747
You're amazing, son.

158
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,661
- Crossover.
- Your hands don't even touch the ball.

159
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:08,762
Huh?

160
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:10,497
Your timing’s off.

161
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:12,541
It's not, Pops. Watch me.

162
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,314
- See? That’s what coach taught us.
- That’s not how it’s done.

163
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,524
You look like a monkey while dribbling.

164
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:22,943
- No, but...
- When you dribble, it's this simple.

165
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,553
Like this.

166
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,138
- You do it well.
- Well, I used to be a varsity player.

167
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,482
JENNIFER: BEFORE YOU REACT,
I JUST WANT TO SAY SORRY.

168
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:35,748
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHY.

169
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,544
IT’S OKAY.

170
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,340
DIANA, DON’T BE TOO NAIVE!

171
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:49,261
AND YOU JENNIFER, YOU HAVE A LOT
TO EXPLAIN. FUCK YOU!

172
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,681
THAT’S ENOUGH, FI.

173
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,810
GIRL, YOU CAN’T BE TOO NICE.
PEOPLE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

174
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,981
JENNIFER, PEACE?

175
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,109
AND YOU MAKE PEACE WITH HER BECAUSE?

176
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:09,740
BECAUSE NICOLE NEEDS US NOW.

177
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,747
Goodbye, Anton.

178
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,019
It's time to forget you.

179
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,105
Everything we did together.

180
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,899
I'm gonna move on now.

181
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,943
I’ll let karma give you hell.

182
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:51,139
One day, someone will love me

183
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:54,468
and treat me right.

184
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,810
I'll forget you.

185
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,247
And there’s no turning back.

186
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,919
God will take care of things.

187
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,071
Karma is a bitch.

188
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:07,781
You're no exception.

189
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,575
Someday...

190
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:14,065
Hey!

191
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,705
He's just a boy

192
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,683
with a small dick.

193
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:27,773
Why are you here?!

194
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,738
My god, the opacity of these bitches!

195
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:32,223
It's audacity.

196
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:33,098
That's enough.

197
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,575
Calm down.

198
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:36,675
We're good.

199
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,061
Really?

200
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,688
You guys made up?

201
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,314
For now.

202
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,274
That hurt!

203
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,503
You hit my boobs. I'm taking care of these.

204
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,613
And I really had bad diarrhea then, okay.

205
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,533
We have something for you.

206
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:52,784
There ya go.

207
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,329
Even though we're not invited,
we have a present for you.

208
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,375
There's no party.

209
00:10:00,843 --> 00:10:01,684
So?

210
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,686
Come on.

211
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,148
Do we really need a party
to celebrate your birthday?

212
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,066
- Of course not. And that's okay.
- True!

213
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,987
He was supposed to be my first dance.

214
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,453
Let me introduce you to my friend,

215
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:21,496
Teendr.

216
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:23,665
Fuck, yeah!

217
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,291
Amazing!

218
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,127
Who's that?

219
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,839
Teendr is a dating app.

220
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,842
It’s easier to move on
when you have lots of options.

221
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,928
Perfect! And since you have more options,

222
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,155
I'm giving you one more.

223
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,640
I also have a present for you.

224
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,432
- Yes!
- Let me introduce you to my pet!

225
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:42,976
Are you ready to know my pet?

226
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:43,935
What's that?

227
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,936
Gimme a minute.

228
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,063
- This is my pet.
- Come on, show it.

229
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,086
And what is it called?

230
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,654
This is stallion extreme.

231
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,204
Thank you.

232
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,501
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

233
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,127
Are you ready to get wasted tonight?

234
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,796
Ready!

235
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,073
Lower! Lower!

236
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:09,417
Lower!

237
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,977
Cheers!

238
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:25,203
Diana,

239
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,305
cheers!

240
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,189
My baby might get drunk.

241
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,415
Oh, right.

242
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,193
- What a weakshit.
- Weakshit.

243
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:33,836
About that,

244
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,006
what's your plan?

245
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,699
And do you know how far along you are?

246
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,034
Not yet.

247
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,013
I still have to go back to
the clinic to get checked.

248
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,890
Where? The one nearby?

249
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,749
If you want, we can go with you.

250
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:48,827
But wait.

251
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,561
Does your baby daddy know?

252
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:51,813
Is he cute?

253
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,231
Was the sex amazing?

254
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,942
Did you both cum?

255
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:55,459
Hey!

256
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,234
Stop!

257
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:57,294
Hey.

258
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,195
- This bitch!
- Watch it!

259
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:01,155
You want me to keep your foul mouth shut?
I don't care if it's your birthday.

260
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,132
Let’s take a shot.

261
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,342
Since both of you have problems,

262
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,118
and both of you are disappointed.

263
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,536
You with your mom,

264
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:07,871
you with your ex.

265
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,956
Cheers!

266
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,707
You really think you're perfect?

267
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,918
I am. As I should.

268
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,611
I'm really the perfect one here.

269
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,588
That's why Jeff is head over heels for me.

270
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,232
Whatever.

271
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,218
You think that jock likes you?

272
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,370
I don't care if he's just a regular jock.

273
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,247
Just as long as

274
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,767
he's my boy.

275
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:31,310
Okay.

276
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,312
You know what,

277
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,755
whenever I see him,

278
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,234
I can hear the church bells ringing.

279
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,051
Calm down!

280
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:39,928
Stop daydreaming.

281
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,339
You guys are not allowed
to get married in church.

282
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,324
Really? Well, same goes for your mom.

283
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,016
Hey.

284
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,435
That’s foul.

285
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,395
Let’s not involve my mom here.

286
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,289
You can talk like that but I can't?

287
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,162
- Fine then! Do whatever you want.
- I sure will!

288
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,228
- So can I continue my story now?
- Fine, go ahead!

289
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,529
Nevermind. You ruined my moment.

290
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,612
I'll tell another one.

291
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,676
Whenever I see him,

292
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:06,471
I imagine myself cooking for him

293
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,432
after he chops up some wood for the fire.

294
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,891
And after that,

295
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,309
we’ll set each other on fire!

296
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:11,868
Gross!

297
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,353
That's disgusting, Fifi!
You know what—

298
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:15,772
Hold up. What now?

299
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:17,435
Are you guys going to fight again?

300
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,069
- And so?
- It's my birthday. We should be happy.

301
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,528
And remember, Fifi, when you said

302
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,947
we should ‘live in the now’?

303
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,891
Why are you all caught up with the future?

304
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,126
She was being a bitch.
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

305
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,320
- Why? I'm telling the truth.
- Bitch.

306
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:31,688
Nicole has a point.

307
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:32,997
I think,

308
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:34,578
she's right.

309
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,776
We should live in the now.

310
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,280
'Cause we'll never know what
the future holds.

311
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,124
So...

312
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,158
let's live in the present.

313
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,098
So I was right, Diana.
That's my line. Right, Nicole?

314
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,559
- Well, it's my line now.
- What?

315
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,228
I said it better.

316
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,898
- And the point goes to the pretty girl!
- Fine, you win! It's all yours!

317
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,109
- But what's mine is my future with Jeff.
- We don't care.

318
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,276
No one gives a fuck.

319
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,780
You lose! Plus she's prettier.

320
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,031
She’s pretty?

321
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,140
Note to self.

322
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:09,976
Stop expecting.

323
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:12,036
Because as they say,

324
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,749
to live a life without expectations
will set you free.

325
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,402
- Pretty face, you pretty!
- Thank you!

326
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,804
Super duper pretty!

327
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,798
Thank you.

328
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,592
But it's not an easy task to do.

329
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,928
So to whoever said that, then

330
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,430
good job, smartypants.

331
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:31,308
Hello?

332
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:33,249
Diana, it's Kent.

333
00:15:35,947 --> 00:15:36,919
Kent?

334
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,468
Can we talk?

335
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:42,069
What for?

336
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,588
You've already made it clear that you won't
take responsibility for this.

337
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:47,113
Diana,

338
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,406
that’s our child.

339
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,262
Oh please, Kent.

340
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,765
Suddenly, it's our child?

341
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:56,439
No, Kent.

342
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,591
Not now.

343
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,067
Not ever.

344
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,257
- Oh my god!
- Easy.

345
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,222
Good morning, ma’am.

346
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,103
It’s you again.

347
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,231
No running away this time?

348
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:42,985
Sign here.

349
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,156
Make sure I can read your handwriting.

350
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,285
How far along are you?

351
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:53,822
Have you been vomiting?

352
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,349
Do you feel any abdominal pain?

353
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,544
Wait, ma'am. I'll answer the form first.

354
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,689
If you can get knocked up at that age,

355
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:06,192
surely you can answer my questions.
Understand?

356
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,569
- I just don't want to mess up.
- Hey, hey!

357
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,321
Enough with the excuses.

358
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:14,267
Kids these days think like
they know everything.

359
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:18,037
I didn't say anything like that.

360
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,071
And one more thing.

361
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:23,901
Your shorts are too short.

362
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:27,905
Maybe that's why you got knocked up early.
You're a slut.

363
00:17:38,074 --> 00:17:40,159
High school student? Pregnant?

364
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,820
You’re not even 18 yet.

365
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,273
And you study in Pacaque?

366
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,400
My god, aren't you ashamed?

367
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,094
Your principal is a friend of mine.

368
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,288
How could they tolerate students like you?

369
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,323
Oh dear.

370
00:17:54,348 --> 00:17:55,199
There,

371
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,534
look at Mary.

372
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,331
Look at her!

373
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:02,248
She keeps on getting pregnant
with different men.

374
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:05,026
She doesn't even have
the means to raise the kids.

375
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:06,627
What's worse?

376
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:09,005
This is her fourth child.

377
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,797
Now what?

378
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,532
Her eldest?

379
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,260
Probably been through
three stepdads, or more.

380
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,512
She's only 30.

381
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:18,289
And yet she looks so old already.

382
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:21,292
My god!

383
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,794
You guys start so young.

384
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,188
As if there's nothing more to life.

385
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,264
You’re gonna give me a heart attack!

386
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,137
You may be pretty.

387
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,307
But you should use your brain more.

388
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,203
So...

389
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:42,496
Your mom's been asking updates from pops.

390
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:43,981
And from the school.

391
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:47,735
The ever fresh Ma'am Jemma
is starting to look haggard.

392
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,378
But girl,

393
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:52,281
you should talk to your mom eventually.

394
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,343
Fine. If you don't want to talk about that,

395
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:59,055
Jeff asked me out at the court earlier.
I was super flushed.

396
00:18:59,787 --> 00:19:00,557
What?

397
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,516
Flushed.

398
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,811
- You got flushed?
- Whatever. He asked me out.

399
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,545
Your shorts are too short, my dear!

400
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,864
Maybe that's why you got pregnant early!
Because you're a slut.

401
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:17,823
Wow.

402
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:19,868
What's with the attitude this early, girl?

403
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,703
Let's go. I don't like it here. Come on.

404
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,072
Wait, what happened in there?

405
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,540
The midwife's got no chill.

406
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:28,209
You know the hashtag for her?

407
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,503
#boomer!

408
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,838
What happened to your check-up?

409
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,548
I was not even checked.

410
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,842
I was judged a lot, though.

411
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,552
Maybe next time.

412
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,529
Let's go then.

413
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,515
- Where's Nicole? Call her.
- There she is!

414
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,601
- Let's go, girls!
- Let's go! Are you ready?

415
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,520
- Comeon.
- Are you ready?

416
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,564
- Wait. I have to give you guys something.
- What is it?

417
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,609
Friendship bracelets!

418
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,860
- Where's mine?
- You made it?

419
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,527
Yes, I did!

420
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,071
This is for Jennifer.

421
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,405
- Okay.
- I made this.

422
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,032
- You really made these?
- Where’s for Diana?

423
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,700
She made this for sure!

424
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,868
Look, look! She definitely made them.

425
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:03,995
Certi-feds?

426
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,205
Feeding program?

427
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,290
- I lost one letter.
- This really is your work!

428
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,126
Wrong spelling. She made it, no doubt.

429
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,088
I just lost one letter!
I know the spelling!

430
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,548
- Come on!
- Let's go!

431
00:20:17,702 --> 00:20:19,427
Let's go!

432
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:21,787
Let's get it on!

433
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,516
Drive faster, Nicole!

434
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:26,893
Come on, let’s go!

435
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:29,795
- Let’s go, Nicole!
- Faster, Nicole!

436
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:33,966
This is so fun!

437
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,122
Hey, Fi!

438
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,736
Is it there? Do you have it?

439
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:37,945
Hold on.

440
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:41,974
Yes!

441
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:43,791
Thumbs up!

442
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:47,288
- Yes!
- Nice!

443
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,441
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes!

444
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,217
Are you guys ready?

445
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:01,369
I’m so ready!

446
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,395
I’m ready!

447
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,589
We're here? Is this it?

448
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,033
Okay, let's go.

449
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,584
Is this the right place?
Be quiet, he might be there.

450
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,084
You check.

451
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,527
Bitch, you check!

452
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,816
- You do it.
- Fuck. Do it, quick!

453
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:15,884
Go ahead.

454
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:20,541
- You do it.
- Nicole, you do it. He's your ex!

455
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:21,555
Quick!

456
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:22,990
- What?
- Let’s go!

457
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,601
- Let's go!
- Give it here. Quick!

458
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,454
Here, catch!

459
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,204
Gimme!

460
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:29,917
Nicole!

461
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:30,692
You ready, Nicole?

462
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:31,218
Catch!

463
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:32,286
Let's go!

464
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:32,978
Ready?

465
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:34,046
What do we write?

466
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,488
One, two, three, go!

467
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:39,448
True?

468
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:40,508
Five four true?

469
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,211
How do you spell "asshole"?

470
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:43,219
For real?

471
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:48,265
There! F-U-C-K.

472
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:49,350
Dumbass.

473
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,085
There!

474
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,687
You missed a spot!

475
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,464
Ti-ny. Tiny!

476
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,066
Tiny!

477
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:57,592
There.

478
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:58,651
It's done!

479
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,237
Nicole, put: Mini!

480
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:03,572
Why are there so many fuck you's?

481
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,867
Mi-ni. There. There!

482
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:10,263
Fuck that bitch, baby.

483
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,959
Let's fuck it. Let's fuck it.

484
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,876
What the fuck?! Nicole!

485
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,295
Fuck you!

486
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,171
Fuck me?

487
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:19,364
Never again!

488
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,430
You bitches!

489
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:31,267
Fuck you, too, moron!

490
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:36,155
Good luck, bitch!

491
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,473
You better hide, fuckers!

492
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:40,733
Fuck you!

493
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,546
Hi!

494
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,088
Mrs. Lisa.

495
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:03,633
- Hi Mrs. Lisa.
- CATHOLIC GIRL DOING UNHOLY THINGS

496
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,592
IS DIANA REALLY PREGNANT?

497
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,578
Shit, girls!

498
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,309
NO WONDER SHE’S PRETTY.
THANKS TO #PREGNANCYGLOW

499
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:16,353
Expectation versus Reality.

500
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:25,012
Diana Santos. You're being called
to the principal's office now.

501
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:35,164
My godmother told me that

502
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:38,167
it's a pro-tip to expect the worst outcome

503
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,795
so you wouldn't be
disappointed in reality.

504
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:46,867
Only that's easy for us to say
because when shit happens,

505
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:52,790
there's no amount of preparation to
get you ready for the worst reality.

506
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,209
Diana.

507
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,681
Please sit down.

508
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:00,130
Here, take this seat.

509
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:01,465
Don't be scared.

510
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,270
Your daughter is very pretty, Mrs. Santos.

511
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:16,230
Good job.

512
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:17,665
You're pretty, too.

513
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,341
Kudos.

514
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,210
But

515
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,304
I really feel bad for Diana.

516
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:24,970
Such a pity.

517
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,407
Because

518
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,868
based on your grades,
you’re very smart.

519
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,312
Intelligent. Your daughter is an achiever.

520
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,747
Very pretty too.

521
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,327
Not to mention she studied from...
I know you had her study

522
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:40,087
in a prestigious catholic school
in Manila.

523
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,498
Wow.

524
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:43,039
Plus her good morals.

525
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:45,693
Yes, yes.

526
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,886
But Diana,

527
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:48,859
there’s something I would like to know.

528
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,240
Since there have been...

529
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,909
Mrs. Santos, there are rumors here
in school.

530
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,895
Rumors

531
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:57,897
about Diana.

532
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:00,816
Diana,

533
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,151
are you pregnant?

534
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,749
Dear?

535
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,514
Yes, I am.

536
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:24,464
Wow.

537
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,276
Mrs. Santos,

538
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,761
this is very disappointing news.

539
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,013
I do not tolerate

540
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,807
any kind of shamelessness

541
00:25:34,021 --> 00:25:36,560
and irresponsibility in this campus.

542
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:39,063
For such a fine woman, Diana.

543
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,065
Aren't you ashamed for your mom?

544
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,317
Be ashamed for

545
00:25:43,434 --> 00:25:44,977
other kids in school.

546
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:45,919
You hear?

547
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:49,590
You, you have this... beauty.
You're very gifted.

548
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:50,883
And yet...

549
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,271
What will the church say if they knew
that Diana is pregnant?

550
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,132
That a student in Pacaque High School
got pregnant?

551
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:58,140
Humiliating. Very immoral.

552
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,542
What will other people say?

553
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,962
What will...

554
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:06,757
Mrs. Santos, what will
her grandparents say?

555
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,223
You're so young, Diana!

556
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,156
So young, so pretty. What a waste.

557
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,557
You still have a future ahead.

558
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:17,701
And now this? It's very immoral!

559
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,378
I'm sorry, Mrs. Santos.

560
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:20,938
I have to expel your daughter.

561
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:37,476
Yuck! This is humiliating.
I have to expel your daughter.

562
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:39,056
My friends needs your help.

563
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,688
Why aren't you ashamed that
classrooms here aren't fit for learning?

564
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:45,629
Be ashamed of that instead, sir.
Pacaque is the name of this school.

565
00:26:46,134 --> 00:26:49,008
I'm so silly. Silly me.

566
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:50,651
Is it your first time on Teendr?

567
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:54,822
Be careful, kiddo.
There are a lot of bad guys online.

568
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,115
Make it hard.

569
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:57,838
Like that.

570
00:26:59,053 --> 00:26:59,952
Sophie!

571
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:04,069
It's my fault because I kept it a secret.

572
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:06,500
I'm pregnant, Mom. Not possessed.

573
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:10,003
Fuck.

574
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:10,754
Diana.

575
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,406
What are you doing here?
