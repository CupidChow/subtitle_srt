1
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,487
We are the stars of Pacaque.

2
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,698
I'm not just a cool gay.
I am gay because I’m a star.

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,741
A Star Gay!

4
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,243
I only make friends with star students.

5
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,137
It always the ugly ones, right?

6
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,954
You mean you?

7
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:38,496
Huh?

8
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,373
I'd like you to meet your newest classmate.

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,958
She’s a transferee from Manila.

10
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:43,643
I'm Diana.

11
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,919
Let's just make sure

12
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,172
she doesn't last long in the star section.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,257
One of you will need to give up their slot.

14
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,409
It's you, Fifi.

15
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
It's me?

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,846
Diana!

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,489
Leave the star section!

18
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,640
Don't tell me what to do.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,517
I have something that can ruin you.

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,810
It's me... I'm pregnant.

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,456
I also have a favor.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,829
Are you sure that was it?

23
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:06,956
It'll get bigger.

24
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,818
I caught them a few days ago.

25
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:10,795
Jennifer!

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,351
I really have to go.

27
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,825
For five years,
I imagined my first sex to be magical

28
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,562
- only for him to finish in five minutes.
- You better hide!

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,371
Fuck you!

30
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,514
It's embarrassing!

31
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,374
I have to expel your daughter.

32
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:27,545
Isn't it more shameful to give up
on your students?

33
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,937
- Boys, this is my girlfriend, Sophie.
- Hi!

34
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,903
Where do you stay here?

35
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,788
Why? Are you going to take me home?

36
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:37,750
Diana.

37
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,349
What are you doing here?

38
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,234
Kent, juice or water?

39
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,078
- I'll have juice.
- Okay.

40
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,576
Diana?

41
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,687
Juice or water?

42
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,540
Water.

43
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,792
Water, okay.

44
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,257
Diana. Sit, my dear.

45
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,007
Come on.

46
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,161
Sit.

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,544
Come on.

48
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,878
Come on.

49
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,025
Choices.

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,944
They say,

51
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,681
life is made up of choices.

52
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,074
You just really have to choose.

53
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,727
They say,

54
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,205
we are defined by our choices in life.

55
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,026
They also say,

56
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,213
we hurt because we choose to hurt.

57
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,871
They say

58
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,142
we are happy because we choose to be happy.

59
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,003
Thank you, Ma.

60
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,438
Thank you too.

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,548
Love you.

62
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:10,899
Love you.

63
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,941
I love you.

64
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,526
I love you and I love you more.

65
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,679
- I love you.
- I love you more.

66
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,157
Let me help you.

67
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,644
That's why,

68
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,120
as they say,

69
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,593
we should always choose to be happy.

70
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,305
Nicole.

71
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,085
Sorry.

72
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:46,126
What?

73
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:48,003
Sorry? Is it me?

74
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,796
Bad breath...

75
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,565
- Does my breath smell bad?
- No!

76
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,441
No!

77
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:56,887
Am I not good?

78
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,031
Sorry, I'll kiss better next time, promise.

79
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:00,891
No.

80
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,406
You don't like me?

81
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,146
It's not you,

82
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:07,958
it's me.

83
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:18,675
You know,

84
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,165
I noticed.

85
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:23,136
Are you gay?

86
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,598
It's okay, promise.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,974
I have a friend who's gay too,

88
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,851
Fifi.

89
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,352
- She's also single.
- I mean, it’s you.

90
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:30,353
Me?

91
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,898
You're just 18
and you're hanging out with me.

92
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,756
A complete stranger in this place.

93
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,916
Maybe not like this?

94
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,023
Look.

95
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,562
I want you to feel safe.

96
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,197
Stop saying "you're just 18"
like it's such a bad thing.

97
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,967
Our age gap isn't that big.

98
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,063
You don't have bad breath.

99
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,378
I just ate some crispy pork.

100
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,862
Does it smell?

101
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,473
Let's go home, so you can brush
your teeth already.

102
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,119
Sorry, okay? Stop teasing me!

103
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,370
They say,

104
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,539
we should alway choose to love.

105
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:32,624
No matter how strange,

106
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:35,303
we should follow our heart.

107
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,203
Bye, Jeff.

108
00:06:11,277 --> 00:06:12,180
What the F...

109
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,584
Fifi. What the Fifi.

110
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,335
But they also say,

111
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:20,273
don't believe in hearsays.

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,386
So who are these people who always say

113
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,413
that we should "do this" or "do that"

114
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,960
or "don't do it"

115
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,123
and keep on telling us to make a choice?

116
00:06:36,593 --> 00:06:37,939
When in reality,

117
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,091
choosing is never easy.

118
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,570
Can I have juice instead?

119
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,888
Juice.

120
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,631
Wait.

121
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,327
Juice might be bad for you,

122
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,453
too much sugar.

123
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,496
Just have water, my dear.

124
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,290
Some people

125
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,666
have no choice.

126
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:58,043
While some

127
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,570
aren't even given a choice.

128
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,001
So...

129
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:13,708
We're here to discuss
the future of your baby.

130
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,044
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:19,923
I'll take responsibility for what happened
between me and Diana.

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,932
Praise the Lord God!

133
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,110
Kent, thank you so much!

134
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,597
What do you mean
you'll take responsibility?

135
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,193
I mean,

136
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,765
I'll marry you.

137
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:33,724
Praise the Lord God again.

138
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,439
Kent, you're like Joseph

139
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,608
- who took in the Virgin Mary's holy son.
- Wait, wait.

140
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,634
Marriage?

141
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:41,980
Why?

142
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,213
Diana.

143
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,570
Yes, marriage. Diana--

144
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:50,453
Didn't you block me?

145
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,153
You didn't want to talk to me?

146
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,107
Then, out of nowhere, you're here?

147
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:56,734
That was then.

148
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,286
Diana, I was just surprised.

149
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:01,634
So now, you're ready?

150
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:02,414
You're okay?

151
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:03,817
Yes, I've thought about it.

152
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,110
Wow!

153
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,320
Thank you so much.

154
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,655
You're so sweet. That's very kind of you.

155
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,639
Diana!

156
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:12,125
Mom. Do you know how unfair this is?

157
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:14,757
I've been carrying this for months

158
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:16,771
- and Kent--
- Well, he’s...

159
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:18,781
here now.

160
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,227
What did your parents say?

161
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,690
They're very excited to have a grandchild.

162
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:28,783
God bless them!

163
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,574
So when's the wedding?

164
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,971
We can have a civil wedding first.

165
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:34,706
Just a small gathering.

166
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,125
Mom, do we really need to get married?

167
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,539
We haven't even finished--

168
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:42,859
- Diana, I can study even if we're married.
- But how about me? What do I do?

169
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,483
Well, you take care of your baby.

170
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,230
You take care of Kent.

171
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:50,150
You are going to be a good mother

172
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,786
and wife.

173
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,325
How about my studies?

174
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:54,117
University?

175
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:54,993
What am I supposed to do about that?

176
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,312
Don't think about it at the moment.

177
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:01,941
- My parents will take care of it. Alright?
- Kent--

178
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,754
Yes, yes. Of course, she's okay.

179
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,297
But Kent,

180
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,937
you have to have a church wedding, okay?

181
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:16,373
So that you will receive all of
the Lord God's blessing and grace.

182
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:19,334
Amen, ma’am.

183
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,730
Girls.

184
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,133
What's our plan for the school break?

185
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,944
I don't know.

186
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:31,763
What more? Sulk.

187
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:36,393
Review for the university entrance exams.

188
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,870
The seminars for the teachers
will take long,

189
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,622
we're not required to go to class anymore.

190
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,315
Then, next semester,

191
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,359
it'll be our last here in Pacaque.

192
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,713
We should at least celebrate
and make the most out of it.

193
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,574
Why y'all being sad?

194
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,665
Well, my dad knows I'm gay

195
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:55,036
but I'm brokenhearted.

196
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:58,081
I don't know how to get through this.

197
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,760
As for me, I understand my mom.
We've already talked.

198
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,089
But the thing is,

199
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:10,927
I don't know how I can accept
her relationship with Sir Dax.

200
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,696
As for me,

201
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:15,516
I don't know if I'll still
be able to study,

202
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:19,144
or just become a full-time wife.

203
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,175
Fifi,

204
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,602
you can get over it!

205
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,836
He's just some guy.

206
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:36,967
You will find a man who will love

207
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:39,120
and accept all of you.

208
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,206
I promise you.

209
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,669
And you, Jen.

210
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,714
I know you're bothered,

211
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:52,510
but you don't have to accept your mom
and Sir Dax's relationship right away.

212
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,293
It's a process.

213
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:56,852
You have to really feel the process,

214
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:58,058
okay?

215
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:03,048
Diana.

216
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:07,942
I know how serious your problem is

217
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,112
and I don't really know what to say.

218
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:13,490
But remember,

219
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,242
whatever happens,

220
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:18,638
whatever your decision may be,

221
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:21,131
we're here for you.

222
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:23,124
Certifieds.

223
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,580
Wow.

224
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,918
You're so full of--

225
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:29,856
wisdom.

226
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,858
True. What’s gotten into you?

227
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,317
Maybe a fever?

228
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,428
No.

229
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,787
I'm just in love.

230
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:40,683
Again?

231
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:50,798
No, no.

232
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,320
Diana. Girls.

233
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:56,116
Just one last shot, promise.
If this doesn't work, I'll let go.

234
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:57,638
Promise.

235
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,142
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

236
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:02,351
Bye.

237
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,793
I also have plans.
I'm gonna get going, girls.

238
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,378
Let's just chat online.

239
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:10,004
- Take care.
- Bye.

240
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,901
- Diana, I'm gonna meet up with my mom.
- Okay.

241
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,033
- How about you?
- I'm good. I'll just stay here.

242
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,618
- Alright, bye.
- Take care.

243
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:32,465
When that happens...

244
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:34,696
Motherfuckers!

245
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,237
Jeff!

246
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:41,911
Can we talk?

247
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:43,429
Okay,

248
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,455
what's up?

249
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,688
Just the two of us in private!

250
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,107
- But I thought...
- No buts!

251
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:52,617
Leave!

252
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:55,758
You think you’re all that?

253
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,244
Is her name Fi too?

254
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:07,078
Yes.

255
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,606
- P-H-I-E.
- I don't care.

256
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,962
Are you happy?

257
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:11,629
Yes.

258
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,458
Do you love her?

259
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:13,859
- Yes, of course.
- Does she love you?

260
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,486
- Yeah.
- That's it?

261
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:19,303
I can love you more than that P-H-I-E!

262
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,264
I'll make you happy every day.

263
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:22,260
Fifi...

264
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:24,767
Jeff. Choose me. You love me, right?

265
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,539
It's not that easy.

266
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:27,974
Jeff,

267
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:29,814
I love you.

268
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:33,479
Why do you like that P-H-I-E more?

269
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:34,689
Can't you accept my fi...

270
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,233
my feelings for you?

271
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:38,990
I also have a heart.

272
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:42,201
I know you have a big heart, Fifi.

273
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,325
- But I can't...
- But what?

274
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:48,519
Are you embarrassed?

275
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,626
It's 2021.

276
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,420
People are used to it.

277
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:55,089
And why would you be embarrassed
if you love me?

278
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,194
But...

279
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,509
But what? All buts! But, but, but!

280
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,427
But what?

281
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,720
But I don't love you.

282
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:05,892
I can't love you the way
you want to be loved.

283
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:09,207
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:10,730
I'm sorry, Fifi.

285
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:27,955
Are you sure you don't have classes today?

286
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:29,435
Yeah.

287
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:32,293
And I've already completed my requirements.

288
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:33,606
Brainy.

289
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,093
Nicole.

290
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,015
About our kiss last night,

291
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,414
- sorry if I'm a little too--
- Tony...

292
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:51,624
It's okay.

293
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,751
Also,

294
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:56,796
I like it too.

295
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:58,527
Really?

296
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,009
Yeah.

297
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,928
You’re a good kisser.

298
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:06,953
Even if

299
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,414
it didn’t last five seconds.

300
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:12,603
Really?

301
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,003
Well, you too.

302
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:16,963
Come on.

303
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:19,298
You don't have to flatter me.

304
00:15:20,383 --> 00:15:22,093
I know I'm not good.

305
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:25,596
I still have a lot to learn.

306
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:28,891
As a noob,

307
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,267
I can say

308
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,520
you'll go far.

309
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:37,817
Why?

310
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,069
Are you going to teach me?

311
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
Teach me?

312
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,055
Teach me...

313
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,036
how to dougie.

314
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:53,557
- Hey.
- You're crazy, I might fall!

315
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,230
I was just kidding, okay?

316
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,422
The water looks pretty deep.

317
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:04,635
Nicole.

318
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,659
Are you really sure about this?

319
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:10,933
Sure about what?

320
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,519
We haven't done anything yet.

321
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,042
Unless... you don't want to?

322
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,798
Not that I don't want to,

323
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,093
I just want a clear answer from you.

324
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,804
Do you really want to do this?

325
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,540
Actually,

326
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,294
I think

327
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,714
I don't want to yet.

328
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,384
I mean, I like you.

329
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,595
I really like you, promise.

330
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,180
- But...
- It’s okay.

331
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:51,682
You don't need to explain.

332
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,394
We don't have to rush.

333
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:57,313
Are you sure?

334
00:16:57,438 --> 00:16:58,626
You're okay with that?

335
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:00,733
Super.

336
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,421
Wow.

337
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:05,988
You got that from me. That "super" line.

338
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,682
That's not true!

339
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:14,371
There's nothing like that in real life!

340
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:15,910
It's not true! Not true!

341
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:18,042
It’s not true!

342
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,711
It’s all fake!

343
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,922
It ain't like that in real life!

344
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,799
There's nothing like that in real life!

345
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,396
- Ouch!
- Dumbass.

346
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:41,649
That hurts.

347
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:44,088
Now,

348
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:45,528
has reality hit you?

349
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,696
You don't have to rub it in, coach.

350
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:50,533
So it hurts?

351
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,096
Are you in pain?

352
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:54,765
Just a little, coach.

353
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,790
Not your head, your heart.

354
00:17:58,415 --> 00:17:59,041
What?

355
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,292
Coach.

356
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:01,460
What?

357
00:18:02,378 --> 00:18:05,256
Is Boys Love all just a fantasy?

358
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,278
Will I ever experience love like that?

359
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:09,593
Fifi.

360
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:13,973
Most of the time, our life as gays
are not like Boys Love stories.

361
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:17,351
So everything's a big lie?

362
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:21,063
Is there no happy ending for us gays?

363
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:21,959
Huh?

364
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,528
I don't know about you but

365
00:18:28,362 --> 00:18:29,800
- I'm tough.
- What?

366
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,637
Fifi, it's like this.

367
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,785
Real life

368
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,934
isn't like what is shown in the movies.

369
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,124
It's different.

370
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,861
Is there anyone who will love us, coach?

371
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:45,087
Of course.

372
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:46,463
I don't want it.

373
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,967
I don't want to love anymore. I'm tired
and I’m done with love.

374
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,869
I'm giving up on love.

375
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,475
Really?

376
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,664
You gotta be kidding me.

377
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,165
Fifi,

378
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:02,688
trust me.

379
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:06,817
Love will always find you.

380
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,170
Love is difficult,

381
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:11,425
whether you're straight or gay.

382
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,971
But for us, it's more challenging.

383
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,912
That's why we give more love.

384
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,684
Fifi.

385
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:21,769
It may be hard for us gays,

386
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,746
but there's a lot to be happy about.

387
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,331
Really, coach?

388
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:26,274
Of course!

389
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,088
When the right time comes,

390
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:29,965
you'll remember this day

391
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,884
and you'll have a good laugh about it.

392
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:33,219
Trust me.

393
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,949
Cheer up!

394
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:36,320
Mel?

395
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:38,844
Let's go. We have a date, remember?

396
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:41,518
My own Boys Love story.

397
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:44,379
Arrived late but he's here now.

398
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:47,657
I'll go ahead, okay?
My date is waiting. Bye!

399
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:48,838
Bye, coach.

400
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:18,722
Jennifer.

401
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:21,662
- Sir Dax. I still have to...
- Jennifer, wait.

402
00:20:25,104 --> 00:20:26,730
I just want to thank you.

403
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,651
Because you accepted me and your mom.

404
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,009
- I just want to...
- I can understand my mom

405
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,054
because she's my mother.

406
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,976
But I don't have any obligation to you.
You're just my teacher.

407
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:46,500
I know.

408
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,524
But I still want to thank you.

409
00:20:53,924 --> 00:20:55,676
You don't know...

410
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,783
how much you mean to your mom.

411
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,744
What is she to you?

412
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,664
A mistress?

413
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,246
- Jennifer.
- No.

414
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,585
Sir Dax, I just want to know the truth.

415
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,943
Since we're already here,

416
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,820
might as well talk about it.

417
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:16,822
Jennifer,

418
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:19,345
I love your mom very much.

419
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:23,704
But...

420
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,435
you have a wife.

421
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,025
We're in the middle of an annulment.

422
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,697
The process is expensive and takes long.

423
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,513
But I'm working on it.

424
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:47,998
I want to marry your mom.

425
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:50,814
If she wants to.

426
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:58,113
But she's not yet annulled too.

427
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:01,554
In my case,

428
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:05,537
I'm still at the final stage
of annulment with my ex-wife.

429
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,415
But I'm doing what I can.

430
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,119
Jennifer.

431
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:19,764
That's how much I love your mom.

432
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,349
That's how special she is to me.

433
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:38,946
I love Jemma.

434
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:53,936
Sorry, Diana.

435
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:56,213
- I just have to prepare some milk.
- It’s okay!

436
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,652
My baby drinks so much milk.

437
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:02,845
Your kid?

438
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,301
Well, yes!

439
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:06,952
Do I look like a grandma?

440
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:11,207
It's okay. I had my baby late.

441
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:16,295
Well, you, when you give birth,

442
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,321
I'm sure it's a girl.

443
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:24,762
You'll probably look like sisters
when she grows older.

444
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:26,618
You look very young.

445
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:32,332
Why did you get pregnant late?

446
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,668
Did you have a hard time conceiving?

447
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,962
Not really.

448
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,417
It was my choice.

449
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,841
I wasn't ready to be a mom back then.

450
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,532
It's good that your husband agreed.

451
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:46,989
Is it his choice to make?

452
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,619
Is he the one carrying the baby?

453
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:54,875
How about you?

454
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,440
What's your plan?

455
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:10,516
This is actually the first time
anyone asked what I want to do.

456
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,877
Are you keeping the baby?

457
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,550
Do I have a choice?

458
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,594
Of course.

459
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,179
You always do.

460
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:29,139
But...

461
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,747
you have to make sure to
stand by the choice you make.

462
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:41,902
I really don't know.

463
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,009
I'm confused.

464
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:47,741
It's like...

465
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:51,370
It's like they've already made
that choice for me.

466
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:53,183
Diana.

467
00:24:53,914 --> 00:24:56,625
This is your life so you get to decide.

468
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,676
Are you telling me to...

469
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:08,949
No, that's not what I'm saying.

470
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,056
What I'm saying is,

471
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,726
no one else should decide but you.

472
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,624
That's your body.

473
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:23,652
I don't know how I'm going to
face them if I...

474
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:25,404
Diana,

475
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:27,927
the only person you have to face
is yourself.

476
00:25:28,966 --> 00:25:30,884
If you make a choice

477
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:33,682
and you're ready to face
yourself afterwards,

478
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:36,081
then all is well.

479
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:41,169
It's your body.

480
00:25:44,756 --> 00:25:49,303
I'm not sure if I'm going to agree
with your choice. But...

481
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,160
I am sure that I won't agree

482
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:57,436
if other people would make
that choice for you.

483
00:26:00,397 --> 00:26:01,440
Anyway,

484
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,521
I better go. My baby is waiting for me.

485
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,814
Alright.

486
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,174
- Take care.
- Okay.

487
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:44,900
Ma.

488
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,879
What's your plan with Dad?

489
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,675
Dear.

490
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:11,530
Ma.

491
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:15,242
I want to know the truth.

492
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:24,001
I already told him that
I want an annulment.

493
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,521
He doesn't want to.

494
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:31,154
Do you...

495
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:36,148
Do you really love Sir Dax?

496
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,711
If your dad finds out that
we have a relationship,

497
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:48,859
he might send us to jail.

498
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:51,278
Because...

499
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:56,430
even if we're separated,
we're still married.

500
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:00,579
I love Dax.

501
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:04,314
But I don't know what to do.

502
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:11,945
May I borrow your phone?

503
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:15,031
I'll try to talk to Dad.

504
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:21,413
We haven't talked in a while anyway.

505
00:28:22,497 --> 00:28:24,186
Maybe...

506
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,313
he'll listen to his daughter.

507
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:28,982
I'll just try, okay?

508
00:28:56,156 --> 00:28:57,240
Hello, Dad?

509
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,288
Diana can give birth in Manila.

510
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:04,873
You have an extra room, right?

511
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:07,209
Yes, ma'am.
We have two guest rooms at home.

512
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,627
Call me Mom.

513
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:10,566
You guys are going to get married anyway.

514
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,630
Mom!

515
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,278
We'll also have a nursery room, Mom.

516
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:16,196
Kent!

517
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:17,302
Kent!

518
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,824
Blue walls if it's a boy,

519
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:20,926
pink if it's a girl.

520
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,162
Perfect! You know what, Kent,

521
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:26,165
I always pray for you to Mama Mary.

522
00:29:27,354 --> 00:29:29,272
You know, they were also teenagers

523
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:30,607
when Joseph and Mary

524
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:34,027
got pregnant with baby Jesus.

525
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,362
- Really?
- Kent.

526
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,134
Yeah. That's why I feel...

527
00:29:37,322 --> 00:29:38,990
- I feel so...
- Mom!

528
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:41,368
Diana!

529
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,308
There's no need to shout.

530
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:54,526
I was talking all this time and yet
no one was listening.

531
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,070
Okay. Okay, what is it?

532
00:29:58,272 --> 00:29:59,323
What is it, dear?

533
00:30:02,764 --> 00:30:04,786
I don't want to push through
with the pregnancy.

534
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:12,732
What?

535
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,019
I might look bitter if I press "angry."

536
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,775
Seems bitter too.

537
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:58,382
Fine, let's go with "like."

538
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,740
Nevermind.

539
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,789
Fucker!

540
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:35,455
Hey.

541
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:53,662
Why'd you use it?

542
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:54,830
That's dirty.

543
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:56,540
You were supposed to throw it.

544
00:31:57,994 --> 00:31:58,786
What?

545
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,087
Just kidding.

546
00:32:02,592 --> 00:32:04,406
You sure this isn't used?

547
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,117
- It smells like...
- Well,

548
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,157
with all the mean things you did to me,

549
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,596
you deserve to be given a used tissue.

550
00:32:11,726 --> 00:32:14,266
Wait, it's you who kept annoying me.

551
00:32:14,396 --> 00:32:15,225
Me?

552
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:18,061
You're just a transferee
but the way you pester me,

553
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:19,671
as if we're close.

554
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:21,923
I'm not a transferee, Fifi.

555
00:32:22,153 --> 00:32:24,259
We've been schoolmates since elementary.

556
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:25,402
What?

557
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,258
You see?

558
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:28,430
You don’t even remember.

559
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,642
You used to ask me for paper
for every quiz we had in fourth grade.

560
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,249
Wow, that's so long ago.

561
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:35,996
You sure?

562
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:36,872
Yeah.

563
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,420
Pretty sure you don't even know my name.

564
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,125
Of course, I do...

565
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:42,444
Jomar.

566
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:47,762
- It’s wrong?
- Not it.

567
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,764
Jejomar?

568
00:32:50,256 --> 00:32:51,002
Nope.

569
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,102
Francis!

570
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,355
Harry?

571
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,226
Yuck.

572
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:58,982
Roque?

573
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,000
Definitely not.

574
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:01,693
Oh, I know! Rody.

575
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:02,736
Gross.

576
00:33:02,902 --> 00:33:03,653
Still not it.

577
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:05,801
Look, I'm sorry.

578
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:11,515
I know I was a bully
and I thought too highly of myself.

579
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:13,288
I'm so sorry.

580
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,645
Don't worry,
I'll remember your name next year.

581
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,066
Too bad I won't be in Pacaque next year.

582
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,210
I'll be transferring.

583
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,127
What?

584
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,447
That's why I dropped by to say goodbye.

585
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:29,449
And to apologize

586
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:31,097
if I hurt you in any way.

587
00:33:40,482 --> 00:33:41,316
I’ll get going.

588
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:43,505
Wait up.

589
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:47,526
Bye, Fifi.

590
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:49,115
I said wait.

591
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,262
Bye!

592
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,472
Hey!

593
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:54,037
Emman!

594
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:55,955
My name is Emman!

595
00:33:58,291 --> 00:33:59,250
Emman?

596
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:02,378
Bye, Emman! Until we meet again!

597
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,317
Bye, Emman!

598
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,610
Emman!

599
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:06,758
Bye!

600
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,385
Bye, Emman!

601
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:21,439
Yes.

602
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:25,630
I understand.

603
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:29,259
Alright, thank you.

604
00:34:32,325 --> 00:34:33,446
Thanks, Dad.

605
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:13,658
Dad said he'll think about it.

606
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,619
We'll talk again some other time.

607
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:20,707
Thanks, my dear.

608
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,461
To be honest,

609
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:30,133
I still can't understand

610
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,178
your relationship with Sir Dax but...

611
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,472
Of course, I want you to be happy.

612
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,079
I know.

613
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:43,521
I'm happy.

614
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:51,883
When I grow older,

615
00:35:54,157 --> 00:35:57,847
will it be easier to understand
how life works?

616
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,958
Actually...

617
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,172
I also don't know, dear.

618
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:12,237
I'm 43 but...

619
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:17,555
I still feel like a 17-year-old

620
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,309
trying to figure things out.

621
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,244
What...

622
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,516
What do you mean

623
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:45,041
you're not pushing through
with the pregnancy?

624
00:36:48,544 --> 00:36:50,171
- Ma, I'm thinking of--
- Hush!

625
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:51,381
Hush!

626
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,780
God might hear you, dear. Don't say it.

627
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,842
Mom, this is my body
so I should decide.

628
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:01,328
It's not yours, dear.

629
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:06,145
God just lent us our bodies! Good heavens!

630
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:07,475
Diana,

631
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:10,041
I'm willing to take responsibility
for our child.

632
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,150
Shut up, Kent!

633
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:12,564
You're not the one giving birth.

634
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:14,633
I won't allow it, Diana.

635
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:16,509
My dear.

636
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:21,035
Do you know how much the Virgin Mary
sacrificed just to give birth to...

637
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,079
I'm not the Virgin Mary!

638
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,770
And the Holy Spirit isn't the father
of the child I'm carrying.

639
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:32,901
Kent and I had unprotected sex
which is why I got pregnant.

640
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:40,179
I'm no longer your innocent baby, Mom.

641
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:44,621
I've grown.

642
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,539
I had sex.

643
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:49,042
And the sooner you accept that, the better.

644
00:37:56,446 --> 00:37:57,363
Diana...

645
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,173
- Please--
- Shut up, Kent!

646
00:37:59,198 --> 00:37:59,969
Shut up.

647
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,830
I've thought about it, Ma.

648
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:13,880
I already talked to Grandpa,
we'll do it in the U.S.

649
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,694
He'll pay for everything.

650
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:20,153
I knew it. Your father's family--

651
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:22,801
- They’re spawns of Satan!
- No, Mom. They just want the best for me.

652
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:24,724
They respect my decision.

653
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:27,810
Well, I don't respect your decision!

654
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:29,729
I'm still your mother!

655
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,440
And when I say you're not doing it,

656
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,984
you're not going to do it!

657
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,426
There are aspects of life that you have
no choice but to accept.

658
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,470
Like your family.

659
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,890
You cannot choose your family.

660
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,977
No matter how much you despise them,

661
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:51,146
they're still your family.

662
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:53,189
Diana!

663
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,942
Diana, let's go for a ride!

664
00:38:56,414 --> 00:38:57,877
Diana, come on!

665
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:59,842
My dear, who are they?

666
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,537
Please, Diana.

667
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:09,956
For our baby.

668
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:17,735
Dear!

669
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:19,070
Diana!

670
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,637
But...

671
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,953
- you can choose your friends.
- Let's go, quick!

672
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:29,701
- Come on!
- Diana!

673
00:39:29,747 --> 00:39:32,291
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere. Let's go.

674
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:33,476
Hey, come here.

675
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,455
Hey!

676
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,838
- You're really going to stay there?
- Diana, what are you doing?!

677
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:37,989
Let's go!

678
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,069
Diana!

679
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,611
- Let’s go, girls?
- Diana!

680
00:39:43,636 --> 00:39:44,178
Come on!

681
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:45,847
- Let's go, let's go!
- Faster!

682
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:46,697
Diana!

683
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:47,932
Diana!

684
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:50,513
Diana! Dear, please!

685
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:53,354
Diana!

686
00:39:58,575 --> 00:39:59,839
And friends

687
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:02,425
are the family you choose.

688
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,434
In the next coming days,

689
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:14,103
they will have to choose.

690
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:27,534
Decisions and choices
that will change their lives.

691
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:33,890
- Wait!
- What?

692
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:35,141
What happened?

693
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,017
Wait.

694
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,727
- What?
- Shit!

695
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:39,959
The engine’s busted!

696
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:42,448
I can't believe this!

697
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:45,923
You took us on a ride
without checking the engine?!

698
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:47,700
You're such a dumbass, Nicole!

699
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,203
- Did you try starting it again?
- Yeah, but it’s not working.

700
00:40:50,203 --> 00:40:51,954
- Damn it.
- We need to push?!

701
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:54,877
- Let's push in one, two, three.
- One, two, three, go!

702
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:55,979
Okay, go!

703
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,586
I can't believe she's making us push!

704
00:40:58,586 --> 00:40:59,858
Game. Okay?

705
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:01,088
One!

706
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:02,548
Hey! What happened?

707
00:41:02,548 --> 00:41:04,800
On the count of three,
you’re not listening.

708
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,178
- Okay, one, two, three, go!
- Okay, go!

709
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:08,471
- Again, together.
- Okay.

710
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:09,384
One.

711
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:10,201
Two.

712
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:10,851
The fuck?!

713
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:14,577
I said, one, two, three, go!
Push after the go!

714
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:16,854
One, two, three, go, then push?

715
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:18,564
- Game!
- Okay, game.

716
00:41:18,564 --> 00:41:19,732
- You ready?
- Okay.

717
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:20,650
One!

718
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:22,193
Two!

719
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:22,944
Three!

720
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:27,031
Go!

721
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:29,075
Hey!

722
00:41:29,075 --> 00:41:30,159
Hey, Fifi!

723
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,702
Wait up!

724
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:35,206
Life is indeed full of choices.

725
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:38,548
But today,

726
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,333
they choose to be teenagers.

727
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:44,433
Free of burden to choose.

728
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:46,738
They just want to be...

729
00:41:48,698 --> 00:41:50,366
The Certifieds.

730
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:51,635
Kidding!
