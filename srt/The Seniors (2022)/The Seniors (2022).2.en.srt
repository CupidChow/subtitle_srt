1
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,112
We are The Certifieds,

2
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,365
the cream of the crop.

3
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:33,556
I'd like you to meet your newest classmate.

4
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:34,618
Hi!

5
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,036
I'm Diana.

6
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:39,594
It's only the first day
and yet she feels so at home.

7
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:43,306
Let's just make sure she doesn't
last long in the star section.

8
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:47,256
I'm very sorry to say but one of you
will need to give up their slot.

9
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,338
Sir, I told you I have suggestions.

10
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,189
It's you, Fifi.

11
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:52,177
It's me?

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,900
Let me go!

13
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:55,093
Open this! Sir Dax!

14
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,008
Dia—

15
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,642
Diana!

16
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:05,536
You think I'm scared?

17
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:07,747
My life is already miserable.

18
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:08,694
I say,

19
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,903
bring it on.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,254
Let's eat.

21
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,824
Let's eat, dear. You'll need it.

22
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:19,867
Oh, wait.

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,244
Let's pray.

24
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:27,250
Lord God, thank you so much for today.

25
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,173
Thank you for these delicious food.

26
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:32,213
Thank you for my daughter, Lord God.

27
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,511
Please guide her,

28
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:37,260
especially in her new environment, oh Lord.

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,011
She—

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,137
Diana, are you okay?

31
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:44,600
- What's wrong?
- Yes, Ma.

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,523
I'm fine. I'm okay.

33
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,813
- Are you sick?
- I'm running late, Ma.

34
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:49,856
I'm gonna go.

35
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,232
Maybe you should just rest?

36
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:52,817
I'll see you later.

37
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,360
See you! Thank you. Bye!

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,407
Okay. Bye!

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,280
Bye, love you!

40
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,119
Sugar high.

41
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:01,496
We all need it.

42
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:05,079
With life as bitter as it is,
sweetness is what we need.

43
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:06,960
When stressed,

44
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:10,714
people crave for the sweetness of sugar.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,587
That's because sugary food

46
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,882
can weaken the body's ability
to respond to stress.

47
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:19,552
Sugar can help you feel less frazzled

48
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:24,269
by suppressing the hypothalamic pituitary
adrenal axis in your brain,

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,107
which controls your response
and blah blah blah blah.

50
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:30,359
Anyway.

51
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,190
Sugar high.

52
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:33,403
Son,

53
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:34,734
are you okay?

54
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:36,343
Yes, Pops...

55
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,115
Huh?

56
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:39,326
We have practice later

57
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,370
so I'm carbo loading.

58
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,287
Huh?

59
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,590
We have practice later, Pops,

60
00:02:53,628 --> 00:02:55,546
so I'm carbo loading.

61
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:59,746
Are you sure Nicole
is going to pick you up?

62
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,469
It's almost seven.

63
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,058
But some say,

64
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,434
what comes up

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,074
must come down.

66
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,604
There's sugar high.

67
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,285
But there's also sugar crash.

68
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,524
Of course, Pops.

69
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,897
We're friends through thick and thin.

70
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,207
She's gonna pick me up.

71
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:16,109
We're The Certifieds.

72
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,723
Good morning, Rafael.

73
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:32,212
Is Chief there?

74
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,559
At the back, boss.

75
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:34,710
Okay, thanks.

76
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,890
Bitch.

77
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:51,727
What the fuck, Nicole?!

78
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:18,049
Hey!

79
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:19,968
It's you.

80
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,079
What a way to ruin my day.

81
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,016
You won't last long.

82
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:27,809
You don't belong here!

83
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,144
Hey!

84
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,183
Hey!

85
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,310
Fifi. You're too loud.

86
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,269
That's true.

87
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,773
You, girls.

88
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,889
I was waiting for so long.

89
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,628
Sorry, girl.

90
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,505
We had to come to school earlier.

91
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,591
We forgot to tell you.

92
00:04:46,616 --> 00:04:49,160
There was a student government meeting.

93
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:51,400
Meeting?

94
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:53,668
Next time, make sure to tell me, okay?

95
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,195
No cellphones?

96
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,281
It's tiring to wait too, you know.

97
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:01,927
Come on.

98
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:04,884
Let's meet up later.
We still have classes. Bye!

99
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:20,441
Fifi.

100
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,194
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:25,321 --> 00:05:27,769
Waiting for the principal. How about you?

102
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,452
Actually, we have a meeting.

103
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:32,954
Meeting?

104
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:34,013
Okay.

105
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,832
Since you're already here,
might as well start.

106
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,584
Take your seat. Please.

107
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:41,045
What is this for?

108
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:43,410
I know what you're doing.

109
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:46,429
Fifi, we've already decided.

110
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,485
Sir Dax,

111
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,155
wait. Hear me out. Please take your seat.

112
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,808
I'm begging you. Sit, please.

113
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,173
Good.

114
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,248
Good morning, Ma'am Jemma.

115
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:01,428
Good morning, Sir Dax.

116
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,668
I am Rafael D. Dimaano

117
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,253
Seventeen years old.

118
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,280
Better known as Fifi.

119
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,119
My middle initial is

120
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:10,996
D.

121
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,248
As in determined.

122
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,538
I was from the star section

123
00:06:15,746 --> 00:06:17,598
but transferred to the lower section

124
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:19,433
because of a transferee from Manila.

125
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,253
I told you it's not
because Diana is from Manila.

126
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:23,087
Sir Dax!

127
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,106
Stop!

128
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,715
This is my report.

129
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,441
We're not yet open for discussions,

130
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:28,301
okay?

131
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,594
I'm here in front of you

132
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,555
to fight for my rights.

133
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,878
My right to go back to the star section.

134
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,421
I am an athlete.

135
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,371
Not just an athlete

136
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,104
but a

137
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:43,024
star athlete.

138
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,168
I have brought home a lot of trophies

139
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:47,903
and medals for this school.

140
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,989
Eight golds.

141
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,407
Seven silvers.

142
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:52,450
Three bronzes.

143
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,702
In total of 21 medals.

144
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,530
Twenty-one?

145
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,835
Fifi, it's...

146
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,016
Your math is wrong.

147
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:00,862
Wrong?

148
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,917
How so?

149
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,198
Why?

150
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:04,003
Eight,

151
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,200
plus seven.

152
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,188
Fifteen.

153
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,786
Plus three... One, two, three.

154
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:09,942
Sir,

155
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,135
I'm gay.

156
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:12,553
I'm not good at Math.

157
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:15,097
But you get the point, right?

158
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,223
Dear...

159
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:17,975
Fifi!

160
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,143
Come again?

161
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,145
Fifi! My name is Fifi!

162
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,772
Yes, of course.

163
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,011
Fifi.

164
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:27,389
I want to explain

165
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,529
that the clustering for
the star section in our school

166
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,799
is based on academic performance

167
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:35,241
or average.

168
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,495
Not athletic performance.

169
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:40,818
Pacaque Rural High School

170
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:43,376
is an academic institution.

171
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,972
Not a sports facility.

172
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,716
We can't just admit you because you got

173
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:52,676
the lowest average.

174
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,719
Sir Dax,

175
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:54,887
I'm sorry.

176
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:59,183
But I told you, this is my report.
We can discuss later. Listen to me first.

177
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:03,062
Did you know?
In a company with diverse employees like

178
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,271
LGBT,

179
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:05,356
woman,

180
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:06,886
and people of color,

181
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,736
productivity increases by 90 percent.

182
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,823
Fifi, we're not a company.

183
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,782
But Sir Dax,

184
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,033
the—

185
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,369
this is the demographics
of the star section.

186
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,413
Out of 18 students,

187
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,748
eleven are guys,

188
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,237
all straight.

189
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,459
For now.

190
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:26,585
Then there are

191
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,586
seven—

192
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:28,879
seven girls.

193
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,913
None of them with color.

194
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,884
My addition will give color to the class.

195
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:37,847
Fifi,

196
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,407
nowadays,

197
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,808
it's not enough that you're gay.

198
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:42,560
Can we just give Fifi a chance?

199
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,272
It wouldn't hurt to add
one student to the star section.

200
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:47,456
I agree.

201
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,941
I agree, Ma'am Jemma. I agree.

202
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,460
- Yes, exactly. Correct! Perfect! Right!
- We can't.

203
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:52,086
Huh?

204
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,046
We can't just add

205
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:56,507
another student to the star section because

206
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,118
the lower sections will complain.

207
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,203
It will only mess up the system.

208
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:01,941
Huh?

209
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,527
What a lousy system!

210
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,613
Fifi, I'm so sorry but

211
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,074
you have to follow the rules.

212
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:10,909
Son of a...

213
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:12,840
Sir,

214
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:13,841
Ma'am,

215
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,051
Do you know what you're doing to me?

216
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,304
You know what this is?

217
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:19,959
This is...

218
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,110
Home—

219
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,220
Homephobia!

220
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,306
Home—

221
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,336
phobia?

222
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:35,112
Yes!

223
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:40,689
Is it wrong?

224
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:42,190
Check it. It's wrong.

225
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,054
It's a typo, sir.

226
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,318
Typo. Wait.

227
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,072
There. It's just a typo.

228
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,722
What you're doing to me is...

229
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:53,435
omephobia.

230
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,233
Omephobia?

231
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,013
Huh?

232
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,111
- It's still wrong?
- Yes, Fifi.

233
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:00,016
Sir Dax,

234
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:02,669
I told you. I'm gay,
I'm not good at spelling.

235
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,754
But you got my point again, right?

236
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:06,256
You know, Fifi,

237
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,925
we're done here, okay? It's done.

238
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:10,956
I'm very sorry

239
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:12,608
but our decision is final.

240
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,030
Okay?

241
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:14,985
No.

242
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:16,349
No!

243
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,239
This can't be. It's 2021.

244
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,450
I'll cancel you on social media
if you remove me from the star section.

245
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,843
This school is homophobic!

246
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:25,025
- Let me talk to the principal!
- Fifi...

247
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,695
do you think

248
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,115
other schools will allow
your hair to be that long?

249
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:35,660
I don't think so.

250
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,503
Are we homophobic?

251
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:38,901
A bit.

252
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:40,052
We have to go.

253
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,458
I'm so sorry.

254
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,002
We have to go. We still have a meeting.

255
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:58,558
Sir?

256
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,197
Did you change your mind?

257
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:02,700
No, Fifi.

258
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,565
Please take off your vest.

259
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,913
You're no longer part of the star section.

260
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,259
Good thing I have an extra.

261
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:44,033
Fuck.

262
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,327
Fuck.

263
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:02,664
I really feel that girl
is hiding something.

264
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,293
Her Instagramn is pretty.

265
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,604
With many followers.

266
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,226
Maybe she bought them.

267
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,258
Girl, 78,000.

268
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:16,523
Don't be fooled, it's easy to fake those.

269
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:18,613
There's a check!

270
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,906
In her Instagramn.

271
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,579
She's verified?

272
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,102
She's verified, so what?

273
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:27,201
Is she certified?

274
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:34,792
Socialite.

275
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,547
Party girl.

276
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:37,579
Looks like it.

277
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,494
She seems like a troublemaker.
Maybe that's why she was dumped here.

278
00:12:42,185 --> 00:12:43,288
Let me see.

279
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,041
But she's an honor student.

280
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:48,601
Top two.

281
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:51,200
Best in Science.

282
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:52,768
Best in Math.

283
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,954
And a leadership awardee.

284
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,155
It looks edited.

285
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,443
If followers can be faked,

286
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,074
then you can fake

287
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,286
trophies and medals, too.

288
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:08,450
Right?

289
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,302
Maybe she just bought them.

290
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:11,316
Most likely.

291
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:13,038
That's how it is in Manila.

292
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,749
Girl, we have a film showing today.

293
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,838
Really?

294
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,922
Yes, let's go.

295
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,294
That's right.

296
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,422
You're so forgetful.

297
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,305
Star section.

298
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:26,581
Yes.

299
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:33,896
Right.

300
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:36,520
Sorry, girls. I keep on forgetting.

301
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,304
Go.

302
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:42,693
Girl,

303
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:45,070
don't worry.

304
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:46,363
Also,

305
00:13:46,388 --> 00:13:49,007
give me that.
You should stop stress eating.

306
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,993
That's not you.

307
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:52,425
Here.

308
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:53,996
Besides,

309
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,874
we won't leave you.

310
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,334
We'll find a way.

311
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:02,838
So you can come back to the star section.

312
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:04,869
I promise.

313
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,009
- Promise.
- We're The Certifieds, right?

314
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,093
Yes.

315
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:12,310
Come on. We'll get going.

316
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,858
Hi, class. This is a group work

317
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,181
and this will require you to be in pairs.

318
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,535
Babe!

319
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:39,504
Jennifer.

320
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,756
Can you take Diana in your group?

321
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,480
Sir, you said—

322
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,422
It's okay.

323
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:46,924
I can make it on my own.

324
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:49,718
Sir, she can do it alone. That's good.

325
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:51,111
No.

326
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:54,644
The purpose of this activity is
for you to know each other.

327
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:55,532
But...

328
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:57,230
It's really fine, Sir Dax.

329
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,148
I can make the project on my own.

330
00:14:59,228 --> 00:14:59,995
I mean,

331
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,611
I'm sure there will be more chances
to get to know my classmates.

332
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,363
It's okay, it's really fine.

333
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,614
I know, Diana.

334
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,487
But for now,

335
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:10,476
this will be a good time.

336
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,161
Jennifer. Nicole.

337
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:15,164
Can you please welcome Diana
to your group, please?

338
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:35,013
You look sad, Fifi.

339
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:36,836
What's the matter?

340
00:15:39,082 --> 00:15:40,006
Nothing.

341
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,426
Symptoms include increase of energy.

342
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,191
Like suddenly having super powers

343
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,778
that allow you to face all
the problems in the world.

344
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,352
I know there's something wrong.

345
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:53,895
You can tell me.

346
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,659
Come on.

347
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:58,120
When your heart beats so loudly

348
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:02,374
that you can't do anything about it.

349
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,375
You know,

350
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:05,698
you don't need to be
part of the star section.

351
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,575
You're already a star.

352
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:10,870
You're an amazing volleyball player.

353
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,218
You sang it, didn't you?

354
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:17,890
And when you're blushing.

355
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:22,715
Here,

356
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:24,425
banana.

357
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:27,053
I bought it for you.

358
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:38,206
Those are some of
the symptoms of sugar high.

359
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,200
Your banana tastes so good, Jeff.

360
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,368
Actually,

361
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:52,829
it's Mrs. Lisa's.

362
00:16:55,093 --> 00:16:56,332
Such a joker.

363
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:00,140
Or maybe,

364
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,712
when you are in love.

365
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:02,939
Or...

366
00:17:07,522 --> 00:17:08,444
Water?

367
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:09,862
Heart attack.

368
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:11,389
Or cardiac arrest.

369
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:12,698
Or heat stroke.

370
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,989
Or other fatal complications.

371
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,984
You like hitting people, don't you?

372
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:39,250
Hi!

373
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:40,877
Let's go.

374
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:41,915
Huh?

375
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,629
Where to?

376
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,356
I'll take care of it.

377
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:50,232
Okay.

378
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,168
Kent! Answer, you asshole!

379
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:14,827
Kent?

380
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,341
Kent!

381
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:17,872
Hello?

382
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,553
Fuck!

383
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:26,255
Diana.

384
00:18:27,728 --> 00:18:29,454
I'm busy, I have no time for you.

385
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:31,231
- Diana!
- Don't shout at me!

386
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:32,374
Don't tell me what to do!

387
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,609
- What do you want?
- I'll shout when I want to!

388
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,003
What do you want, Fifi?

389
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,767
Don't call me Fifi!

390
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:39,089
We're not close!

391
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:41,466
What I want is for you
to leave the star section!

392
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,939
Don't tell me what to do.

393
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,709
I won't give you my slot because again,

394
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:47,619
I deserve it.

395
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,520
Deserve?

396
00:18:48,582 --> 00:18:49,725
You don't deserve it.

397
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,919
You're just a transferee.
I've been here longer, I deserve it more!

398
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,688
My grades are higher than yours.

399
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,702
That's how the system works. I'm sorry.

400
00:18:56,882 --> 00:18:57,799
No.

401
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,885
I'm going to the girl's bathroom.

402
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,391
Do you identify yourself as a woman?

403
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,392
No.

404
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:07,229
I identify myself as a bad bitch.

405
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,660
And I won't stop

406
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:10,520
until you leave the star section.

407
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,484
Well, good!

408
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:12,571
Good, Fifi.

409
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:15,863
Because I identify myself
as a bad bitch too.

410
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:17,323
So can you please?

411
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,225
Stop harassing me!

412
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,851
I'm not harassing you.

413
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm not stopping
until I go back to to the star section.

414
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:25,285
Fifi, please!

415
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:26,453
Can you just please

416
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:28,317
stop harassing me!

417
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:32,167
I've already got a lot of problems.
I have so many things on my mind!

418
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,144
Please, not now.

419
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:35,504
Please.

420
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,385
Why are you crying?

421
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,752
If you think you can cry your way
with me, you're wrong.

422
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,975
I won't fall for your tricks.

423
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,341
All I want is for you to leave
the star section.

424
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,986
- I need to be in the star section.
- I need this too.

425
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:57,655
Need?

426
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,295
You're from a private school.

427
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,781
For sure, you've experienced
star section treatment.

428
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm not used to public schools, Fifi.

429
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,414
I need the star section.

430
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:09,108
Diana, my dad will get furious.

431
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:12,253
So will my mom.

432
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:14,088
Diana,

433
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,087
if my dad finds out,
he'll hang me upside down.

434
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,839
Fuck you, asshole!

435
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,289
- Fuck you too, vagina!
- Not you, shut the fuck up, Fifi!

436
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,113
Diana, did you hear me?

437
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:28,056
If my dad finds out, he'll beat me up.

438
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:30,016
- He'll hang me upside down—
- I don't care!

439
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:37,528
Hi, Ma!

440
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:38,904
How are you?

441
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,682
Ma, are we coming home together later?

442
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,101
I can't.

443
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:46,604
I still have a lot to finish.
Look at these.

444
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:47,605
There's a lot.

445
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,750
You work so hard, Mom.

446
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,083
It's only the second day
and you've got so much to do.

447
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,116
You know we're short
on teachers here in school, right?

448
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,799
Who else would do this but us.

449
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,290
By the way, has Dad called yet?

450
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:08,709
He hasn't.

451
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,211
Not yet.

452
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:13,059
Maybe he's still busy there in Saudi.

453
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:16,133
Don't worry, I'll text him.

454
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:19,220
Alright. So I'll go ahead?

455
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:22,068
- Yes. Take care.
- Bye, love you.

456
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:23,195
Take care.

457
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,863
- Love you.
- Love you.

458
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:26,535
- Finish quickly, okay?
- Yes.

459
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,742
- Don't come home too late.
- I only have a few more.

460
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,536
Sir Dax. Sorry,

461
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:32,954
it almost fell.

462
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:34,331
Jennifer.

463
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:46,551
WATCH THIS, GIRLS! I'LL DO THIS TO DIANA!

464
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:49,804
SLAP!

465
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:53,433
GIRLS, LET'S RIDE HOME TOGETHER, OKAY?

466
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:56,394
I JUST NEED TO PRACTICE FIRST.

467
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:04,194
NICOLE, I KNOW YOU SEE THIS.
YOU BETTER BRING US HOME LATER.

468
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,064
Anton,

469
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:14,108
what's this?

470
00:22:16,581 --> 00:22:17,737
Field.

471
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,794
Why are we alone?

472
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:22,783
Do you want to do it in groups?

473
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:24,910
Huh?

474
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:26,454
I don't get it.

475
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,152
I just want to be with you alone.

476
00:22:29,177 --> 00:22:32,418
Wait, someone might see us.

477
00:22:34,516 --> 00:22:36,046
No one's here, don't worry.

478
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:45,781
Anton, wait.

479
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:48,488
I'm not yet ready.

480
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,889
But your 18th birthday is too far.

481
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,781
It's not. It's only a few weeks away.

482
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,683
What if

483
00:22:57,706 --> 00:22:59,236
I get into an accident?

484
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:01,213
I won't even be able to do it with you.

485
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:04,216
That's not possible. It won't happen.

486
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,928
You're always like that.

487
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,338
You never give in to my requests.

488
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:19,188
Just like Daddy.

489
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,275
With Dad...

490
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,857
he's always away from home.
And with you...

491
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:26,526
I may be a congressman's son

492
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:28,945
but I have

493
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:30,947
no one to talk to

494
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:33,867
who really knows me.

495
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,581
I want it to be special.

496
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,084
Special in what way?

497
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:46,492
Well...

498
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:49,382
you know...

499
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:52,569
with rose petals on the bed

500
00:23:52,594 --> 00:23:55,934
and on the floor.
When you follow the petals,

501
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,754
you'll see our pictures on the ceiling.

502
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,510
There are comfy blankets
and twinkling lights.

503
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:09,027
Then romantic songs would play.

504
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:12,572
Oh my god.

505
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:18,858
I don't want to

506
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:22,665
lose my virginity in a car.

507
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:33,122
Come on, don't be mad.

508
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:35,374
Just a few weeks left.

509
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,571
Promise.

510
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,669
It will we be worth the wait.

511
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:40,683
Super.

512
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:42,423
Super smoky.

513
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:46,886
Fine.

514
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:48,696
Give me a kiss.

515
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:51,015
Okay.

516
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,175
Down here.

517
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,499
No. I'm not yet ready, right?

518
00:25:00,537 --> 00:25:02,209
Next time, okay?

519
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:05,375
Next time. Stop sulking now.

520
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,383
You're home late, dear.

521
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:30,487
I just went for a walk, Mom. For fresh air.

522
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:34,141
Okay, set the table now. Let's eat.

523
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:40,120
Mom, I have something to tell you.

524
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,828
What is it, dear?

525
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,821
Mom.

526
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:52,130
Hello?

527
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,845
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

528
00:26:00,013 --> 00:26:01,055
Okay.

529
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,020
It's the lending company.

530
00:26:07,812 --> 00:26:09,301
They say our payment is due.

531
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:11,316
I thought you paid for it already?

532
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,775
Not all of it.

533
00:26:13,627 --> 00:26:14,836
But don't worry.

534
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:17,184
The Lord God will provide.

535
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,117
We just need to lessen the expenses
until we've paid our debts.

536
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,898
What were you saying, dear?

537
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:33,379
Mom...

538
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,635
Mom, don't get mad, okay?

539
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:44,349
By the way, there was a vigil earlier.

540
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:47,044
I joined them and they said

541
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:50,663
I should tend to the Virgin Mary

542
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,273
since we just moved here.

543
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,484
Who am I to refuse, right?

544
00:26:55,586 --> 00:26:57,921
- Mom. it's—
- There's an upcoming prayer vigil.

545
00:26:57,946 --> 00:27:00,519
Let's join, okay?
You know that

546
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:02,896
I prayed for you to be like
the Virgin Mary.

547
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:04,494
And now, look.

548
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:06,955
I have the best daughter.

549
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:10,124
Never one to make trouble.

550
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:13,590
Oh, wait.

551
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,964
What were you going to say? I'm sorry.

552
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:22,845
I'm hungry.

553
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:25,640
Is that all?

554
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:29,702
But first, let's pray the novena
to Mama Mary, please.

555
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:30,603
Okay.

556
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:49,823
Let's go.

557
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,819
Close the gate.

558
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,503
Go to the barangay hall first.

559
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:56,200
Yes, Chief.

560
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:57,297
Son.

561
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,578
Why are you still here?

562
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:00,954
Also,

563
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,416
why are you wearing
a jacket when it's so hot?

564
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:05,863
Because Pops,

565
00:28:05,888 --> 00:28:06,977
you know that

566
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:08,241
it's Thursday, right?

567
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:10,783
So what if it's Thursday?

568
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,521
Does it snow in Pacaque every Thursday?

569
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:15,986
Pops,

570
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:17,505
we wear sweaters

571
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,543
on Thursdays.

572
00:28:18,568 --> 00:28:20,099
Me and The Certifieds.

573
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:22,017
That's why it's sweat-thurs.

574
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:23,493
Alright.

575
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:24,995
You're not riding the tricycle?

576
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,413
Are you sure

577
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:27,535
they'll pick you up?

578
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:29,399
Yes, Pops. They'll be here.

579
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,165
They always come for me. I'll be fine.

580
00:28:32,665 --> 00:28:33,474
Okay.

581
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,684
I'm going to the barangay hall now.

582
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,489
Okay, Pa.

583
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:37,462
Sweater Thursday?

584
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:38,492
Take care, Pops!

585
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:41,566
Thursday...

586
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:42,467
Wednesday...

587
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,343
Sweat-thur?

588
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:44,969
So that's the trend these days?

589
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:47,388
Thursday sweater?

590
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:49,766
So nothing happened?

591
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:51,309
None.

592
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:53,311
Why?

593
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,485
I said I'm not yet ready.

594
00:28:56,564 --> 00:28:58,232
So Anton got mad?

595
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:00,556
Super.

596
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:04,017
He said his abdomen hurt.

597
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,770
Excuse me.

598
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,124
You asked me to come early so that we
could talk about the school project, right?

599
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,028
I read all about that, it's not true.

600
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:16,380
Really?

601
00:29:16,501 --> 00:29:17,381
Yes.

602
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,591
Girls even have periods every month.

603
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:22,469
If we can take it, so should guys.

604
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,871
Girl,

605
00:29:24,008 --> 00:29:25,914
he asked for...

606
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,303
For?

607
00:29:30,223 --> 00:29:31,170
You know.

608
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:34,256
What?

609
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:36,979
What's that?

610
00:29:43,695 --> 00:29:45,004
Did you do it?

611
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:46,948
Of course, not.

612
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,158
And why?

613
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,206
I don't want to.

614
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:53,262
I'm also scared of getting pregnant.

615
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:54,330
Shit.

616
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:55,794
You're right.

617
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,113
A blowjob doesn't get you pregnant.

618
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,926
You're not part of the conversation.

619
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:06,096
Well, we're not talking about
the group project.

620
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:08,098
So I decided to join your conversation.

621
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,751
Why? Do you have anything to contribute?

622
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,438
Well, I was thinking we could do—

623
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:17,232
How are you verified on Instagramn?

624
00:30:17,311 --> 00:30:18,358
Nicole.

625
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:20,982
Why? I'm just curious.

626
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:22,487
No, it's okay. It's fine.

627
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:26,783
My friend's dad in Manila works
for Instagramn. Connections.

628
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:29,073
Yeah. Do you want to get verified?

629
00:30:30,366 --> 00:30:31,325
Super.

630
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,368
- Yeah, I can help you.
- Nicole!

631
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,887
- It's okay. It's fine.
- What's wrong? I really want to.

632
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:36,038
It's fine. I'll help you.

633
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:37,223
Let me see your Instagramn.

634
00:30:37,248 --> 00:30:39,459
- I really want it.
- Let me see.

635
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:42,620
Oh, well first...

636
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:44,384
you need to be remarkable.

637
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:45,761
Is that so?

638
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:46,887
Let's take a selfie.

639
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:48,513
Huh?

640
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:49,890
Let's take a selfie.

641
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:51,612
Girl...

642
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:52,638
Jennifer.

643
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:54,724
- Do you wanna join us for a selfie?
- No, I'm okay. I'm busy.

644
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:57,201
- Come on, just a selfie.
- No, I'm good.

645
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:59,591
Come on, this is gonna be really cute.

646
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:02,903
Here, sit beside me.

647
00:31:03,516 --> 00:31:04,446
Selfie.

648
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,852
No matter how many candies Fifi eats,

649
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,107
he can still taste
the bitterness of betrayal...

650
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:20,379
You bitches!

651
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,876
Traitors!

652
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,337
And you.

653
00:31:29,175 --> 00:31:30,038
You.

654
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,844
You animal!

655
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:32,887
Girl...

656
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:34,931
this is for a group work. And—

657
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:35,757
And?

658
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:36,699
And what?

659
00:31:36,724 --> 00:31:37,909
Where are your sweaters?

660
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,118
It's Thursday!

661
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:41,229
We wear sweaters on Thursdays!

662
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:44,011
Girl, why wear a sweater
when it's this hot?

663
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,817
Hot?

664
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,865
Of course, I know it's hot!

665
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:51,159
I walked from our house going here

666
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,199
because you forgot to pick me up again!

667
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:54,913
Hey,

668
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:57,094
I texted you. Did you not receive it?

669
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:57,958
I didn't.

670
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,622
I didn't receive anything.

671
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:01,128
That's not my fault anymore.

672
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,084
Or maybe you replaced me

673
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:04,043
and for—

674
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,966
You replaced me so you—

675
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,309
You've forgotten our friendship
so you ditched me?

676
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:21,727
You didn't even text?

677
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:25,189
Take that sweater off
so you wouldn't be so hot-headed!

678
00:32:25,189 --> 00:32:27,775
We have to go to class. Let's go.

679
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:30,444
Sorry, girl.

680
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:32,196
Sorry.

681
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:42,874
Fucking shit!

682
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:45,293
Fuck this shit!

683
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,670
Good morning, class.

684
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:49,284
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.

685
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,716
Are you ready for your reporting?

686
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:53,847
Jennifer.

687
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:55,887
I'd like you to present first.

688
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,977
Sir, isn't that for tomorrow?

689
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,729
Jennifer,

690
00:33:01,017 --> 00:33:03,060
you're running for valedictorian.

691
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:04,883
I can always count on you.

692
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:10,989
Sir, we're...

693
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,392
- We're not yet...
- It's okay, sir.

694
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:14,944
Our group is ready.

695
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:17,354
We already have a Canva presentation.

696
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,464
Thank you.

697
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,105
Very good, Diana.

698
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,024
Great work and impressive research.

699
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,930
Class, that's how you do a report.

700
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:39,100
I wish I could take all the credit, sir.
But I didn't do it alone.

701
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,993
Jennifer did the research and Nicole made
the Canva presentation.

702
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:45,565
I just helped.

703
00:33:45,937 --> 00:33:48,831
That's good. Great teamwork.

704
00:33:48,856 --> 00:33:50,274
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

705
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:52,835
Okay, for the other groups,
we'll do it tomorrow.

706
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,236
See you tomorrow. Class dismissed.

707
00:33:54,236 --> 00:33:55,934
Thank you, sir.

708
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:03,358
Oh my god. I have one thousand followers
on Instagramn!

709
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,402
Diana!

710
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:10,044
Thank you.

711
00:34:10,836 --> 00:34:11,700
It's okay.

712
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:13,756
By the way,

713
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:19,178
do you want to hang out with us
at my place later? With Nicole.

714
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:22,974
For movie marathon and some snacks.

715
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,101
- Is that tonight?
- Yes.

716
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:28,771
I have other plans.
Next time, maybe?

717
00:34:29,063 --> 00:34:30,402
- Sure.
- Take care.

718
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:31,444
You too.

719
00:34:35,987 --> 00:34:37,905
Are we friends with Diana now?

720
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:40,337
Well...

721
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,493
She seems kind.

722
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:47,164
And useful. She also gave you
lots of followers.

723
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:51,293
And she saved us earlier. So...

724
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:53,533
maybe?

725
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:57,913
Sugar.

726
00:34:58,426 --> 00:34:59,789
It can be addicting.

727
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:01,833
It's not always good.

728
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:05,270
It should always be in moderation.

729
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:06,521
But  sometimes,

730
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:08,269
- no matter how much we try to avoid it
- Daddy!

731
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:10,438
and restrain ourselves,

732
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:13,065
we still go back to the delight

733
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:15,234
and sweetness of sugar high.

734
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,198
Thank you, Daddy.

735
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:19,326
I miss you, sweetheart.

736
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,744
Good thing you texted me.

737
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:22,120
Daddy?

738
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:25,995
As in sugar daddy?

739
00:35:26,245 --> 00:35:27,334
Possibly

740
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,331
because of the bitterness of life.

741
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:31,921
Let's eat out?

742
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:32,672
Okay.

743
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,798
As they say,

744
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:34,883
desperate times

745
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:38,328
call for dirty old men with diabetes.

746
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:43,846
Oh, Diana, Diana, Diana.

747
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:46,974
I knew it.

748
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,465
I will cancel you.

749
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:56,442
Ma!

750
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,723
I bought some groceries.

751
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:03,144
I have some savings left
so I used it for grocery.

752
00:36:03,657 --> 00:36:04,563
Diana.

753
00:36:05,826 --> 00:36:08,775
You have a guest.

754
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:10,902
It's Fifi.

755
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:13,863
Hi, Diana!

756
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,326
Did you eat?

757
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:20,704
Let me cook for you.

758
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,676
What are you doing here, Fifi?

759
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,304
Paying you a visit.

760
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:38,571
Why?

761
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:39,598
Am I not allowed?

762
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:41,737
Is there a requirement to visit you, Diana?

763
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:43,059
What are you talking about?

764
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:45,328
Oh, I know!

765
00:36:45,588 --> 00:36:50,050
Should I be a rich old man
to visit you, Diana?

766
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:52,711
Yes.

767
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:54,629
I saw it all.

768
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,506
- I saw you with that old—
- Don't!

769
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:58,383
Don't. Just don't.

770
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,135
Don't me.

771
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:01,886
Be quiet.

772
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:03,638
Stop talking.

773
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,985
Are you ordering me around?

774
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,303
What do you want?

775
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:09,431
You know what I want.

776
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:11,976
I won't give you my spot
in the star section.

777
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:13,606
Okay.

778
00:37:13,686 --> 00:37:14,895
Auntie Elaine!

779
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:16,468
- Auntie El—
- Wait.

780
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,187
You want?

781
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:34,611
This is why you have pimples.

782
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:16,248
Hi, everyone. It's your girl, Fifi!

783
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:20,044
I'm back again! And again! And again!

784
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:21,382
You don't belong here.

785
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:27,176
For gays like us, we work harder
just to gain respect.

786
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:28,264
I'm not gay.

787
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:29,182
Fifi!

788
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,142
I bought bananacue just for you.

789
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:36,898
I also have a favor.

790
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:39,984
I think it's your cig I'm holding.

791
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:41,540
Are you sure that was it?

792
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:42,625
It will get bigger.

793
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,391
You should be holding books, not dicks!

794
00:38:47,352 --> 00:38:48,380
I have something that can ruin you.

795
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,090
You think I'm scared?

796
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:51,508
I will ruin you.

797
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:54,232
Not if... I ruin you first.

798
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:56,876
It's me, I'm pregnant.
