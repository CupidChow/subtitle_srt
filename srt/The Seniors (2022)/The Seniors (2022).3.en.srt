1
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:27,986
Diana!

2
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,613
Get out of the star section!

3
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:30,864
Fifi, please!

4
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,515
Don't call me Fifi!

5
00:00:32,788 --> 00:00:33,909
We're not close!

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,785
Are we friends with Diana now?

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,079
She seems nice.

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,081
Traitors!

9
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,086
Anton, wait a sec.

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,213
So nothing happened?

11
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,298
I said I'm not yet ready.

12
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,509
And I don’t want to get pregnant.

13
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,745
Mom, I have something to tell you.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,514
There's an upcoming prayer vigil.

15
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's join, okay?

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,310
You know I prayed for you
to be like Mama Mary.

17
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,686
I won't give up.

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,838
I will cancel you.

19
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,149
What are you doing here, Fifi?

20
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:07,651
Paying you a visit.

21
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:11,989
Should one be a rich old man
to visit you, Diana?

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,272
Hi, everyone! It's your girl, Fifi!

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,667
I'm back again! And again! And again!

24
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,834
And again!

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,628
The star has returned

26
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,199
to the star...

27
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,075
section!

28
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,052
And you, guys.

29
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:35,470
You better be ready

30
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,373
because I will make your life like hell.

31
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:40,696
- Because I won't stop—
- Fifi!

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,519
Why are you here?

33
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:46,310
Yes, Sir Dax. I am here.

34
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:49,192
Didn't you get the letter from Diana?

35
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,403
She said she'll transfer
to the lower section.

36
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,756
No. I didn't receive any letter.

37
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,825
I have to talk to Diana first.

38
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,910
So you didn't receive it yet?

39
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:00,370
That's so sad.

40
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,189
Okay, sir. Go talk to her.

41
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:03,415
Bye!

42
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,876
After going through

43
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:06,976
all kinds of abuse,

44
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,170
insults, and struggles,

45
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,215
the real hero returns.

46
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:15,051
Everything in the past made him stronger

47
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,303
and better than ever before.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,515
Hi, girls!

49
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,976
It's your girl, Fifi.

50
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,886
Remember your ex-friend who got transferred
to the lower section?

51
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,359
- Fifi...
- Wow!

52
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:33,236
You remember my name?

53
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,638
I feel honored.

54
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,133
Fifi, we had no choice.
And besides—

55
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,184
And you!

56
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:41,286
After gaining more followers,

57
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,437
you forgot about me.

58
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,522
No choice?

59
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,873
You have a choice.

60
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:46,840
And you chose to forget me.

61
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,362
Girl, you're being unfair.

62
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,464
What could we do?

63
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,076
We see Diana every day. It's only fair
since she's our classmate.

64
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,910
So I'm unfair. You think I'm unfair?

65
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,151
Jennifer, you know what's unfair?

66
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,683
It's unfair

67
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,254
that you forgot to pick up
your so-called friend.

68
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,824
It's unfair that I wore a sweater to school
under the scorching heat

69
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,519
because I thought both of you
were wearing it too.

70
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,338
What's also unfair is you replaced me

71
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,780
with a new friend.

72
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,448
That's what’s unfair, Jennifer!

73
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:22,394
By the way, I have good news for you.

74
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,288
You may be smart,

75
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:27,791
but I'm the clever one.

76
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,607
I have my own ways.

77
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,632
If I can drag Diana down
to the lower section,

78
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,384
I can do it to you too.

79
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,386
That's impossible.

80
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,346
I'm smart.

81
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,847
I'm top of the class. I'm—

82
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,848
You're what?

83
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:45,976
Diana is smarter than you.

84
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:47,686
If I was able to kick her out,

85
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:49,896
I can definitely do it to you too.

86
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:51,574
And to you too!

87
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,525
Why me?

88
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,444
Why you?

89
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,483
All you ever do is copy from Jennifer.

90
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:58,551
You do it too.

91
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,468
Sometimes!

92
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,089
But now,

93
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,576
I've changed.

94
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,828
- Okay.
- I'll make sure you fail.

95
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:06,396
You're the one with failing scores.

96
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:14,229
Hey!

97
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,172
What are you doing here?

98
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,281
You don't belong here.

99
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,303
What are you saying?

100
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:22,746
I changed my mind.

101
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,598
I deserve this spot.

102
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,558
You deserve that spot?

103
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,810
- But...
- But what?

104
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,020
Huh?

105
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,521
Now,

106
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,732
leave.

107
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,528
Do you want me to spill the tea?

108
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,654
Go ahead.

109
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:41,323
Tell them.

110
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
With receipts.

111
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,119
Diana has...

112
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,870
Diana.

113
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:47,704
Sir?

114
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,373
I changed my mind. I take back the letter.

115
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,209
I'm a star student again.

116
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,543
And Fifi

117
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,046
is back, back, back

118
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,339
in the lower section.

119
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,465
You can't do this to me.

120
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,425
I can. And I just did. Sorry.

121
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,409
Huh?

122
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,126
Fifi.

123
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:05,872
I’m sorry.

124
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,288
Again?

125
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,367
You’re sorry again?

126
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,420
You want to go through this again, Fifi?

127
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:13,338
What do you mean?

128
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:17,203
What?

129
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,827
Bye!

130
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,070
You better be ready
because he will take his revenge.

131
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,548
No enemy will be spared.

132
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,744
He is out for blood.

133
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,664
And everyone shall pay.

134
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:48,849
Fifi!

135
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,766
Are you okay?

136
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:50,725
I'm okay.

137
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,811
Up your game! I thought
you wanted to play.

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,620
Fifi,

139
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,313
we want to play volleyball

140
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,940
but your energy is for wrestling.

141
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,091
What can I do?

142
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,901
It's just that Diana makes my blood boil.

143
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:02,445
Again!

144
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,880
- Girls!
- Toss it again.

145
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,506
Enough.

146
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,283
Enough. Enough.

147
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:07,934
Fifi,

148
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,061
I think you need more practice.

149
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,204
Coach, you're back.

150
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:12,163
Hi.

151
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,164
Of course!

152
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,192
I heard about what happened.

153
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,376
Coach...

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,338
can you please ask the faculty to bring me
back to the star section?

155
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,673
Come on, Fifi.

156
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,551
You know I only have limited powers here.

157
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,054
Can I know why you're so obssessed
with being part of the star section?

158
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,656
Cause I'm a star.

159
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,957
Okay, look at me.

160
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,542
When I was studying here, Fifi,

161
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:34,242
I was a regular student.

162
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,979
And look at me now,

163
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,506
I'm a P.E. teacher.

164
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,510
With no voice during faculty meetings.

165
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,945
Coach, that's not true.

166
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,573
The team looks up to you.

167
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,591
I’m kidding.

168
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,201
You’re so gullible.

169
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,537
My only point, Fifi,

170
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,581
is that your section doesn't matter.

171
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,542
As long as you work hard
and do your best,

172
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:58,840
you’ll go places.

173
00:06:59,002 --> 00:06:59,961
Of course,

174
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,005
they're at an advantage
in the star section.

175
00:07:02,234 --> 00:07:02,943
Right?

176
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,257
That’s why

177
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,550
you should work harder.

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,410
Double your efforts.

179
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:09,725
Fifi,

180
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,998
I understand you.

181
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:13,857
I'm also gay like you.

182
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,727
And for us,

183
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,022
we need to work harder

184
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,940
just to gain respect.

185
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:22,475
I get that.

186
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,361
I’m not gay.

187
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:26,421
Sorry.

188
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,223
- I thought—
- Just kidding.

189
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,825
Look, my dad won't let me play volleyball

190
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,869
if he finds out I'm not in the
star section anymore.

191
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:35,021
So I really need to go back
to the star section.

192
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,873
Look, Fifi...

193
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,917
Fifi!

194
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,796
Hi, Coach!

195
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,323
I bought bananacue just for you.

196
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,851
So much for not being gay.

197
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:05,532
Girl, look at this.

198
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,320
He's a ten, right?

199
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,697
He's a five.

200
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,393
You're no fun. Your standards are too high.

201
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,287
Girl, look. Cute, right?

202
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,249
I told you.

203
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,169
At least even if there’s a lot of
handsome guys in Manila,

204
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,547
Diana still knows how to
spot good looks.

205
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:29,255
Diana, are you okay?

206
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:32,358
I'm okay.

207
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:34,748
I’m just thinking about something.

208
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:45,477
Is there a hospital
or small clinic around here?

209
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,821
The hospital is far but there's a clinic

210
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,473
near the market. Just a small one.

211
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:53,366
Why? Are you sick?

212
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,644
No, it's my mom.

213
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,904
She has...

214
00:08:58,129 --> 00:08:59,172
fever.

215
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,483
Are you sure you're okay?

216
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,637
Jennifer. Nicole. There's...

217
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,563
What happened to her?

218
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,362
I have the right to sit here

219
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,014
because I'm a Certified.

220
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,535
Fifi, you're always welcome here. Anytime.

221
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,786
Shut up, Nicole.

222
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,898
I'll be eating here so suffer
in my presence.

223
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,125
Fi...

224
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,880
you know the star section
is different from

225
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,673
the lower section.

226
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,175
I know.

227
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,594
But we've been friends for years.

228
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,763
How could you replace me
just like that?

229
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,475
You can't blame us
if we're friends with Diana.

230
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,519
She's our classmate.

231
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,379
But I'm your friend.

232
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,563
Well...

233
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,482
ex-friend.

234
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,526
Fi, like I said,

235
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,695
we became close friends because

236
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,365
we've been classmates since first year

237
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:19,285
until, well, the other day.

238
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,164
So now that I'm in the lower section,

239
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,457
we're not friends anymore?

240
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,042
We're still friends.

241
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,102
Just not that close.

242
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,320
Just admit it,

243
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:31,635
you replaced me with Diana.

244
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,342
Diana is kinda nice, you know?

245
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,387
If you become friends,
I'm sure you'll get along.

246
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,289
Nice?

247
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,292
That bitch is not who you think she is.

248
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,524
What do you mean?

249
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,280
Diana doesn't know what to do.

250
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,824
Right now, all she knows

251
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,993
is that she needs to hold on.

252
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,370
That a real hero

253
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,538
will throw up

254
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,790
but will never give up.

255
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:10,420
But a part of her also wants to give up.

256
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,298
Is there still a future for her?

257
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:14,728
Well,

258
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:18,119
at least her boobs look bigger now.

259
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:22,515
Diana doesn't know what to do.

260
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,310
And just like your typical Gen Z,

261
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:29,981
desperate times

262
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,826
call for

263
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:33,635
the internet.

264
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,673
Fifi!

265
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,742
What were you saying about Diana?

266
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:59,112
Same question.

267
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,246
Well...

268
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,498
she's chic.

269
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,784
Her phone's up to date.

270
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,020
Of course. She's a Manila girl.

271
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,941
Let's be honest: Things are more advanced
in Manila than here in the province.

272
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,669
Also, she's from a private school, right?

273
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,155
And the tuition is expensive
in private schools.

274
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,532
Her parents must be rich.

275
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,326
Her lifestyle there is expensive.

276
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,579
She has a high-end phone
and branded clothes.

277
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,623
Partying in clubs and bars

278
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,083
cost a lot.

279
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,834
You spend thousands per night.

280
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,045
Where do you think she gets the money?

281
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,923
What are you trying to say, Fifi?

282
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,677
OMG.

283
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,262
Don't tell me—

284
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,374
Diana is a hooker?

285
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,226
Well...

286
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,310
Not—

287
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:51,337
No.

288
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:52,558
But...

289
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,382
maybe?

290
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,068
You're not sure?

291
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:58,386
She has a sugar daddy.

292
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,737
Sugar daddy?

293
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,822
Sugar daddy.

294
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:05,827
Those rich old men who give you money
in exchange for your time.

295
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,746
Sugar daddy.

296
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,273
How did you find out?

297
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,109
I saw her yesterday.

298
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,862
Daddy!

299
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,072
I miss you, sweetheart!

300
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,491
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Daddy?

301
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,970
As in sugar daddy?

302
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,304
Let's eat out first?

303
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,097
Okay.

304
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,185
I knew it.

305
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,647
I will cancel you.

306
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,928
An old man was inside the fancy car.

307
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,740
He was hugging Diana then
he gave her money.

308
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,366
So where are your photos?

309
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,617
Your receipts?

310
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,411
- Videos?
- None.

311
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:50,188
- None?
- None.

312
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,875
Are you really a Gen Z?
Why didn't you take a video?

313
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,738
How do we know you're not making these up?

314
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,464
Pictures or it didn't happen!

315
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,159
She's right, maybe you're just trying
to make Diana look bad.

316
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,570
I'm your friend here.

317
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,598
- Why won't you believe me?
- Fi, we’re just saying...

318
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,185
if you're gonna spread
this in Pacaque

319
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,978
and you don't have proof,

320
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,356
they won't believe you.

321
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,485
You were removed from the star section
because of her.

322
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,972
Now you're spreading rumors
without receipts?

323
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,491
How would anyone believe you?

324
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,766
Come here.

325
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:47,954
Do you believe Fifi?

326
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,847
Just let him be.

327
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,435
Eventually, he'll accept not being
in the star section.

328
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,438
Your birthday is coming up, right?

329
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,525
It's your debut! How's the preparation?

330
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,111
It's okay.

331
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,323
- Actually, my mom was thinking—
- I'm sure

332
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,018
it will be the best debut celebration
in Pacaque.

333
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,372
Of course! Of course.

334
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,916
- Anyway, I’m gonna go.
- Okay.

335
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,501
I have a date.

336
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,961
- Good luck.
- Bye.

337
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,931
In a hurry?

338
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,350
Do you have a date with your sugar daddy?

339
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,169
Don't try me, Fifi.

340
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:37,478
And why not?

341
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,772
You know I have something
that can ruin you.

342
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,524
You think I'm scared?

343
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,818
Fine, spread the news.

344
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,863
Go ahead, Fifi. I'll even help you.

345
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,241
What if your mom finds out?

346
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:53,119
I'll go to your house and tell her.

347
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:56,570
If you do that...

348
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,678
Trust me.

349
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:00,985
I will ruin you.

350
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,046
Not if...

351
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:05,300
Not if...

352
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,425
I ruin you first!

353
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,511
If you tell my mom,

354
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,346
I...

355
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,181
will make sure...

356
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,020
you'll go far worse than being
in the lower section.

357
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:20,880
You got that?

358
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,926
Just leave the star section!

359
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:28,946
It stinks!

360
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,349
And that's a no.

361
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,354
Fuck you.

362
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,104
Just drop me here.

363
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,664
Thank you.

364
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,330
Hey!

365
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:20,498
Pay up.

366
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,071
Sir, this is all I've got.

367
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,240
It's not enough!

368
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,238
I'm Chief Dante's son.

369
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,807
I'll pay the rest tomorrow.

370
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,809
Or later, you can go to our house.

371
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:41,836
Okay.

372
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:53,281
Babe.

373
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,366
Yes?

374
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:58,773
Didn’t you

375
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:03,249
promise me before that you'll take care
of my 18th birthday party?

376
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:04,834
Yes.

377
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,034
Is it extravagant?

378
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,131
Of course.

379
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,465
Anything for you.

380
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,508
Really?

381
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,054
I want to invite the whole star section.

382
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,809
You can even invite the whole
Pacaque Rural High School.

383
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,810
Really?

384
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:23,728
Of course.

385
00:18:23,753 --> 00:18:26,088
Daddy is a congressman.
He'll take care of it.

386
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
Thank you.

387
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,282
Babe?

388
00:18:36,544 --> 00:18:37,366
Yes?

389
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,410
I also have a favor to ask.

390
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,062
What is it?

391
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,957
Anton.

392
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,335
I thought we agreed to do this
after the debut, right?

393
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,544
Come on.

394
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,589
Just hold it. Don't look
so it won't spoil you.

395
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,340
- But, babe...
- Please?

396
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,176
Please? Just for five minutes.

397
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,617
Babe, that's too long.

398
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,112
Fine, one minute.

399
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
It's still long.

400
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,682
Fine, thirty seconds.

401
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,933
Lower.

402
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,145
Fine, five seconds.

403
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,106
Okay, fine. I won't look, okay?

404
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,316
Okay.

405
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,200
Babe?

406
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,205
I think it's your cig I'm holding.

407
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:25,289
What?

408
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,290
It's not.

409
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,958
Go deeper

410
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,877
so you can hold it properly.

411
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:39,512
Alright.

412
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,975
That was more than five seconds already.

413
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:48,270
Hold it again.

414
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,247
Babe, next time.

415
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,108
Next time.

416
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:53,275
Fine.

417
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,069
Are you sure that was it?

418
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,488
Of course.

419
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:59,156
It will get bigger.

420
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,783
Really?

421
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,101
Okay.

422
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:08,512
Look,

423
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,710
the doctor isn't here today.

424
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,879
She'll be back next week.

425
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,049
What? I thought she has
a schedule today?

426
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:18,968
Mrs. Linda,

427
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,387
I don't control her schedule.

428
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,931
She's only a volunteer doctor.

429
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,102
If you want,

430
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,062
just come back when she arrives.

431
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:37,361
Hey!

432
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,127
Do you know Mr. Kanor's mistress?

433
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:42,783
Yes, Linda.

434
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:47,121
She was here.
Oh my, she's six months pregnant!

435
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:48,998
Yes, she just left.

436
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,332
Meanwhile,

437
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:52,084
Hilda was also here yesterday.

438
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,003
She's also pregnant, for three months.

439
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,396
My god!

440
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,991
I won't be surprised if they end up
seeing each other here.

441
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,180
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you.
I'll call again later. Bye.

442
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,516
Hey, miss!

443
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,895
Visiting hours are over.

444
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,897
Did your mom give birth here?

445
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:15,733
Huh?

446
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,389
Come here.

447
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:23,890
What?

448
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,913
Here, tell me. Sit down.

449
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,791
It's just...

450
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,110
What?

451
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,383
It's just...

452
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,243
Huh?

453
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,720
It's me...

454
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,848
It's me...

455
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,476
I'm pregnant.

456
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,853
How old are you?

457
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,941
Twenty one.

458
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:58,025
What?

459
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,069
- Twenty-one.
- Give me your I.D.

460
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:09,161
Seventeen.

461
00:22:09,186 --> 00:22:10,454
That's the problem.

462
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:12,581
You're even lying.

463
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,917
Kids nowadays are careless.

464
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,213
Students like you should be
holding books, not dicks!

465
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,632
So what do you want me to do?

466
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,637
It's like there's...

467
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,414
there’s some...

468
00:22:30,546 --> 00:22:31,433
What?

469
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,977
There's blood.

470
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,813
It's called spotting. That's normal.

471
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:37,785
Do your parents know?

472
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,484
And the guy who knocked you up?
Where is he?

473
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:42,528
Huh?

474
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,115
My goodness.

475
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:47,514
Anyway,

476
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:49,785
avoid getting stressed.

477
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,662
Make sure to rest, okay?

478
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:56,625
Don't carry anything heavy. Come back
next week so the doctor can see you.

479
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,003
Why do you keep moving?

480
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,005
Hey! Miss!

481
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,143
Kent!

482
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:14,935
Diana.

483
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:16,687
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

484
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,773
Sorry, I'm just busy
with uni applications.

485
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,942
- How are you?
- Kent, I'm pregant.

486
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,903
With our child.

487
00:23:24,711 --> 00:23:26,380
Are you sure that's mine, Diana?

488
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,298
You fucking asshole!

489
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:27,990
There's no one else—

490
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,743
- I know I'm not the only one who did it—
- Fuck, Kent!

491
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,609
Help me out here!

492
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,152
I haven't told, Mom.
I don't know what to tell her.

493
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:36,623
I don't know what
to fucking do, Kent.

494
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,317
You'll take responsibility, right?

495
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,003
Kent!

496
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:43,088
Kent!

497
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:44,146
Hello?

498
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:46,550
Kent!

499
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,760
Fuck you!

500
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:49,553
Fuck you!

501
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,770
So...

502
00:23:57,795 --> 00:23:59,480
you not only have a sugar daddy.

503
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,119
You also got knocked up.

504
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,124
I’m n—

505
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,827
I just passed by the clinic.

506
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,079
I just—

507
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,538
I only passed by.

508
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,024
I heard everything,

509
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,409
Diana.

510
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:22,211
Okay.

511
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:25,339
I'm pregnant, Fifi.

512
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,840
Okay? Happy now?

513
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,092
Fuck yeah!

514
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:32,554
I'm happy. I'm super happy because
I can go back to the star section,

515
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,390
where I really belong.

516
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,797
Sometimes,

517
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,034
the return of the fallen hero
is not to take revenge.

518
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,997
And not to make the villains suffer.

519
00:24:59,123 --> 00:24:59,832
Hey!

520
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:04,253
If you think crying will work
on me, you're wrong.

521
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,471
It's yours...

522
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,866
You can have the star section, Fifi.

523
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,959
It's all yours.

524
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:21,837
All yours.

525
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,652
It was mine to begin with.

526
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,759
In that moment, Fifi realized

527
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,261
that maybe, in this story,

528
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,538
he's not the only main character.

529
00:25:57,955 --> 00:25:59,850
He still believes that he is the star.

530
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:02,878
But he slowly accepts

531
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:07,716
that there are other stars in the sky.

532
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,413
That maybe Diana is not the real enemy.

533
00:26:20,307 --> 00:26:21,163
Here.

534
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,321
I give up, Fifi.

535
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:07,776
Hello, Ma.

536
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,086
Yes, dear?

537
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,338
Are we eating dinner together?

538
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,784
I'll be going to your godmother's house,
we have a faculty meeting.

539
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,711
Sorry, we still have a lot to do.

540
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:23,827
But last night, you also
finished late, right?

541
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,229
Don't worry, I cooked something earlier.

542
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,526
Just heat it up for your dinner.

543
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:31,024
It's in the freezer.

544
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:34,194
Okay. I'm with Nicole, by the way.

545
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,866
Okay, Ma. I love you.

546
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,531
I love you, my dear.

547
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:42,519
Hey.

548
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,662
Diana.

549
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,206
Diana!

550
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,377
We've been walking for hours,
let's go home.

551
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,171
I can go home on my own.

552
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,298
Diana, let’s go together.

553
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:56,341
I'm okay. Promise.

554
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,427
Diana, let's go.

555
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,095
Fifi, I'm really okay.

556
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:01,430
No.

557
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,516
Let's ride the tricycle together.

558
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,393
I want to make sure you get home.

559
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,728
Fifi, I'll let you know. Promise.

560
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,895
I'm fine.

561
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,827
Don't worry.

562
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,274
You're so stubborn.

563
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,211
Let's just go together.

564
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:17,738
- Fifi, it's okay. I'm okay.
- Diana, look.

565
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:18,514
Look.

566
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,658
I don't have money.

567
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:23,577
Let's go home together.

568
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:26,432
So that's why.

569
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:28,207
Let's go.

570
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:29,666
Really?

571
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,294
Are we going now?

572
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,692
Good evening.

573
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:57,919
Jennifer? Hello.

574
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,783
Is my mom with you?
She's not answering my calls.

575
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:07,146
No. She's not here.
Why would she be here?

576
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:12,855
I thought you have

577
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:16,046
a faculty meeting?

578
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:20,759
We had it in the faculty room earlier.

579
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,220
In reality, there's only one enemy.

580
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:25,138
You also had

581
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,140
a meeting yesterday, right?

582
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,558
Life.

583
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:33,063
Huh? No. Our meeting was last week.

584
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,774
A week before the opening of classes.

585
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,384
I see.

586
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,887
Okay. Thank you.

587
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,491
Life

588
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:46,393
is a bitch.

589
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,498
But they should be bitchier.

590
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,713
And like a real hero,

591
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,490
they should come back stronger,

592
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,535
and better than ever before.

593
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,335
Who's there?

594
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,753
What do you want, Diana?

595
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,756
I want you to put Fifi
in the star section.

596
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,616
The Certifieds are now complete!

597
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,367
Certified?

598
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,927
We're not part of
The Certifieds anymore.

599
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,495
The both of us, we are...

600
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,788
We’re the—

601
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,873
The Verifieds?

602
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:33,874
- Super? Super!
- You see? Super!

603
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,042
The teacher

604
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,936
that I am most grateful for

605
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,671
is also my mother.

606
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,966
Hey! What’s up! What’s up!

607
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,987
And of course, we have our own
stunt too you know!

608
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,155
You want war?

609
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,906
I'll give you war.

610
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,058
I'll take this too.

611
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,726
Preggies have sensitive taste in food.

612
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,019
Who's pregnant?
