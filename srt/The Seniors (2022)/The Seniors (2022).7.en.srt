1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,837
Our BFF needs help.

2
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:32,933
This is extreme booze.

3
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,685
Are you ready to get wasted tonight?

4
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,119
Ready!

5
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:37,344
- What now?
- Let’s go!

6
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:39,064
Give it here.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,707
For real?

8
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:41,667
True?

9
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:43,851
Let's fuck it!

10
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:45,143
You guys better hide!

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,657
Fuck you!

12
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:52,469
Please report to
the principal's office immediately.

13
00:00:52,494 --> 00:00:53,620
Diana,

14
00:00:53,947 --> 00:00:54,997
are you pregnant?

15
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:03,470
Some people refer to the stars
as a guide for the future.

16
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:04,997
What did they say? You hear anything?

17
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:07,468
- Nothing. Are they shouting?
- Keep it down.

18
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,751
Stars give people clarity

19
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,655
- when in doubt.
- This won’t do. Move!

20
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:12,973
- Gurl!
- Ouch!

21
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,726
It's your fault.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,385
But not all the time.

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,063
You move too much!

24
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:22,441
What did I told you so?

25
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,502
Let me see.

26
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,170
Look.

27
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:29,855
Oh my gosh, I'm bleeding.

28
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,899
My hemoglobin's down to 52.

29
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,293
I'm gonna die! I won't get to

30
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:36,737
go to college. Or to enroll
for the second semester.

31
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:38,822
Worst of all, I'll die a virgin.

32
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:40,125
You're overreacting.

33
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:43,076
The cut isn't even that deep.

34
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,079
The good thing is, you got
your period before you died.

35
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,973
Look, it isn't even near a cut.

36
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,801
Bitch, stop it.

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,668
I'm gonna pull that braid off your head.

38
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,529
Does it hurt?

39
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,375
Of course! Why don't you try being pricked?

40
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,808
I've tried, it doesn't feel that good.

41
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,438
Maybe because it barely touched you.

42
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:03,665
Wow.

43
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,734
Coming from you?

44
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,036
I like the character development.

45
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,050
Our future valedictorian is finally
interested in juicy topics.

46
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:14,868
Is this your version 2.0?

47
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,029
Be quiet.

48
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,862
What a pity. Such a fine woman.

49
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,124
Only to get knocked up at a young age?

50
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:22,225
Yuck!

51
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:23,518
Yuck!

52
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm sorry, Mrs. Santos.

53
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,553
This is humiliating.

54
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,549
I have to expel your daughter.

55
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:31,802
Sorry, what did you say?

56
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,763
Say that again.

57
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:36,213
I have to expel her.

58
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:39,091
No, not that. The other one.
When you said that--

59
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,894
that this school

60
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,246
does not tolerate

61
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:45,332
shamelessness

62
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:47,766
and you're ashamed of my daughter

63
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,420
because her pregnancy is immoral.

64
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:52,412
- Yes.
- Are you also a parent?

65
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,021
No, but--

66
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,634
- Would you even say that to your own kid?
- So, are we going to stay here?

67
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:56,927
Just here?

68
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,054
Where do we go?

69
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,307
I'm gonna skip class,
I have to find Mom.

70
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:03,875
As you should.

71
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:07,094
I'm skipping too.
I'll just attend our training.

72
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:07,869
- Really?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:08,855
Hey, hey.

74
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:10,107
Because of Jeff?

75
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:11,790
But I thought you're injured?

76
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:13,692
Nicole, when you love someone,

77
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,554
you’re willing to endure the pain.

78
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,889
- How old-fashioned.
- What?

79
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,172
Dumbass.

80
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:21,174
I said I’m an old soul.

81
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,062
Haven't you read my bio on social media?

82
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:28,775
So, what now?

83
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,194
Are we going to leave Diana?

84
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:33,061
Can we even do anything about it?

85
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,880
You're the one who
wanted to bust in there.

86
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,093
Look,

87
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,177
she can handle this.

88
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,028
She's a strong independent woman.

89
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,654
Let’s just meet later then?

90
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:44,207
- Sure.
- Okay.

91
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:45,642
I'll find my mom first.

92
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:46,810
I’ll find my daddy Jeff.

93
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,378
Bye, virgins.

94
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:51,523
What?

95
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,416
But I'm the only one who had...

96
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:51,348
MA, WHERE ARE YOU?

97
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:53,558
MESSAGE SENDING FAILED.
NOT EOUGH LOAD BALANCE.

98
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:19,444
Jennifer.

99
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,885
- Where's your mom?
- Have you seen my mom?

100
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:55,188
Do you know where my mom is?

101
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,151
No.

102
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,032
She hasn't replied to any of
my messages and calls.

103
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,203
They said that...

104
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,314
that you guys might be on a trip.

105
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:17,527
She didn't contact you?

106
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,204
Jennifer.

107
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,099
I'm sorry if...

108
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,315
If only I can make it up
to you for everything.

109
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:40,467
Do you...

110
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,251
do you really want to?

111
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,437
My friend needs your help, sir.

112
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,577
You take pride in this school's values

113
00:07:00,602 --> 00:07:03,146
but the principal himself

114
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:05,373
has questionable values!

115
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:09,829
Isn't it more shameful to
give up on your students?

116
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,914
Please calm down, Mrs. Santos.

117
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:17,598
Sir--

118
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:21,132
I would like to say something.

119
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,679
Sir, you know we can't just
expel Diana, right?

120
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,322
Just because she's pregnant.

121
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,407
The law doesn't allow that.

122
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:30,742
You know that.

123
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,352
So, you think you're better than me?

124
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,230
You have no right, Mr. Dax.

125
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,790
In case you forgot,

126
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,833
I'm the superintendent's son.

127
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:42,921
I am the principal of
Pacaque Rural High School.

128
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,039
I am the law!

129
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,325
Have some shame.

130
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,487
Sir, are you saying that you're ashamed

131
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,349
because a student got pregnant

132
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,600
at "your" school?

133
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:57,227
"Your" school, sir?

134
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:58,645
Huh?

135
00:07:59,209 --> 00:07:59,980
Then sir,

136
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:03,149
why aren't you ashamed that classrooms
here aren't fit for learning?

137
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,527
Books aren't enough for one whole class.

138
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:09,114
Teachers are overworked and underpaid.

139
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,075
Shouldn't you be ashamed
of that instead, sir?

140
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:15,270
You're just as pretentious
as this school's name.

141
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:18,481
- Have a little shame!
- Leave.

142
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:20,890
Mr. Dax, get out of my sight!

143
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,528
I said leave!

144
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,822
Ms. Diana. Mrs. Santos. Get out!

145
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:40,535
Such a disgrace!

146
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,364
Hey, girl.

147
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,490
What happened?

148
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:54,409
It stinks.

149
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:56,745
Fi!

150
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:58,273
What happened to you?

151
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:59,080
What?

152
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,498
Scram!

153
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:02,525
Wait.

154
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,219
- Ouch.
- What happened?

155
00:09:13,641 --> 00:09:16,890
Do you see it? It hurts a bit.

156
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:19,684
- Does it hurt here?
- Ouch!

157
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,577
Fuck, that hurt.

158
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:25,914
Next time, please be careful.

159
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:28,123
Yes.

160
00:09:51,815 --> 00:09:53,134
Friggin slow.

161
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,786
Don't you have wifi?

162
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,329
We don't. This ain't a computer shop.

163
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,665
What a bitch!

164
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:07,982
Up.

165
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,386
Serves you right.

166
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:27,402
Ma, why did you do that?

167
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:32,282
I'm the one asking the questions.

168
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:35,410
Because...

169
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,570
who am I to you?

170
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,949
I'm your mom, right?

171
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,378
And I won't allow anyone

172
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:49,174
to talk to you like that.

173
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,407
Thank you, Mom.

174
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,786
- Thank you.
- Of course, baby.

175
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,066
I got you.

176
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:15,800
Fi.

177
00:11:16,036 --> 00:11:17,343
What's yummier?

178
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:20,737
Sweet banana?

179
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:21,498
What?

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,043
Or just peeled banana?

181
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,420
It's just a banana.

182
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:28,980
Stop with the dirty thoughts.

183
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:29,756
What?

184
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,123
I knew it. It's embarrassing.

185
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,750
No, no. It's okay.

186
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,043
What is it?

187
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:36,169
Well...

188
00:11:36,252 --> 00:11:38,671
I want to give my special banana
to someone.

189
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:41,232
I can give chocolates soon
once I am on the national team.

190
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:42,811
I'm still tight on budget.

191
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,151
Who’s the lucky person?

192
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:48,291
It's a surprise.

193
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:49,775
I don't wanna ruin it.

194
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,601
No need for suprises.

195
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:53,421
Jeff, you know what,

196
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,216
whether your banana is sweetened or peeled,

197
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,484
I'm sure that person will like it.

198
00:11:59,484 --> 00:12:01,236
That person will gladly accept all of it.

199
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:02,680
- Really?
- Of course!

200
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:04,030
As long as

201
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:09,410
it isn't too sweet.
The person might get diabetes.

202
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,172
Since you're too sweet.

203
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,710
I'm ready to give

204
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,090
all my love.

205
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:19,264
As sweet as my banana.

206
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,575
Ouch.

207
00:12:38,982 --> 00:12:41,901
Are you doing it on purpose? It hurts.

208
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:43,204
Can I have a look?

209
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,919
Thank you so much.

210
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:01,114
Sir?

211
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:01,813
Dax.

212
00:13:01,838 --> 00:13:03,214
- Short for Dickson.
- Dick, what?

213
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:10,857
Sir Dax is our class adviser
in the star section, Ma.

214
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,518
I wish all teachers are like you.

215
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:18,271
Teaching comes from the...

216
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,742
heart. From the heart, yes.

217
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,445
Sir, thank you.

218
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:28,766
Okay.

219
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,059
We'll get going.

220
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,461
Take care.

221
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:33,087
Thank you, sir...

222
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,173
Dax. Sir Dax.

223
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:36,966
Yes, okay.

224
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:56,694
What an oldie!

225
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:58,279
So ugly!

226
00:13:58,936 --> 00:13:59,937
Super!

227
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:01,491
Hard pass.

228
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,375
Two kilometers.

229
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,211
It's near.

230
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,129
Plus he's good looking!

231
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,330
This might work.

232
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,290
Hold on.

233
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,797
HI.

234
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,102
Hi.

235
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:37,600
HELLO! WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

236
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,770
Tricycle?

237
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,398
Nope. Delete, delete.

238
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:47,912
Milk tea?

239
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:52,959
Wait.

240
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:53,783
Wait!

241
00:14:53,783 --> 00:14:57,870
We stare at the stars
because they twinkle beautifully at night.

242
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,885
But because of how beautiful they are,

243
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,379
we tend to forget that stars

244
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,172
are just balls of gases.

245
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,018
Boss, someone’s looking for you.

246
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,884
Specifically, mostly of

247
00:15:11,884 --> 00:15:13,302
- hydrogen and helium
- Sophie!

248
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:15,189
that produce light and heat.

249
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,208
Bros,

250
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,000
meet my girlfriend.

251
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,168
- This is Sophie.
- Hi!

252
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:19,784
Hi, Sophie!

253
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:20,962
Burning.

254
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:22,171
Hello!

255
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:23,614
And blinding.

256
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:25,940
Lucky you!

257
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,672
- I can only wish.
- Lucky you, you have Phie as your girl!

258
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:30,246
No need for another Fifi here.

259
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,082
I am the only Fifi.

260
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,361
Let’s go.

261
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:01,169
Tissue?

262
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:02,545
Sorry, sorry.

263
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,506
I'm not usually like this.

264
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:11,429
Is it your first time on Teendr?

265
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:12,930
Sup...

266
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,792
Of course not!

267
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,418
Try using other apps.

268
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,854
Teendr isn't common here.

269
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:21,022
What?

270
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:23,149
You have to take care, kid.

271
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,401
There are a lot of bad guys online.

272
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,595
Excuse me,

273
00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:30,139
I'm of legal age.

274
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:31,974
You look younger.

275
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:34,964
You are creeping me out.

276
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:39,357
Why?

277
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,192
Did I say anything?

278
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,319
Nothing.

279
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,531
You're young but

280
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,241
you seem to know a lot.

281
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,704
Me?

282
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,125
Knows a lot?

283
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,202
Brainy?

284
00:17:01,227 --> 00:17:02,004
Me?

285
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:07,225
Aren't you the smart one?

286
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,460
I know if it's sarcasm or not.

287
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:10,529
Really?

288
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:11,722
Super.

289
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:14,267
Brainy.

290
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:17,478
Really?

291
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:25,319
Nicole?

292
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,688
Nicole!

293
00:17:29,355 --> 00:17:30,700
Sorry, sorry. What?

294
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,567
Oh, wait.

295
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,829
You look really unfamiliar.

296
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:36,914
You're new here in Pacaque, right?

297
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:38,099
Yeah.

298
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,876
I came from Manila.

299
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:46,581
Why do people from Manila
always end up here in Pacaque?

300
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:47,942
What?

301
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,053
You and Diana know each other, right?

302
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:52,805
Who is she?

303
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,802
Sorry.

304
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:01,772
I'm so silly.

305
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:03,389
Silly me.

306
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:05,193
Nevermind.

307
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,729
I like your laugh.

308
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,869
Excuse you.

309
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,121
Sorry, but...

310
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:21,032
you won't get me through
cheesy pick-up lines.

311
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,710
I've been there.

312
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,045
I learned.

313
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,130
I learned a lot.

314
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:27,747
Don't worry.

315
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:30,666
I'm not the romantic type.

316
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:34,795
So...

317
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,558
Where do you stay here?

318
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:39,285
Why?

319
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,770
Are you going to take me home?

320
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,441
Actually.

321
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,379
Tony!

322
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,132
Let's go!

323
00:18:53,786 --> 00:18:54,759
- Where to?
- Come on!

324
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:56,218
Leave it me.

325
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:57,668
You sure?

326
00:18:57,693 --> 00:19:00,029
Yes, very sure so hop in.

327
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:02,782
I'm really sitting here?

328
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:03,834
Game!

329
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,051
You sure it's safe here?

330
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:13,559
Yup!

331
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,096
Look, it's perfect.

332
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,754
Just the two of us.

333
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,477
You might do something to me.

334
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:24,720
Excuse me?

335
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:25,856
No, no.

336
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:28,109
What I mean is

337
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:31,028
we barely know each other.

338
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:34,438
Then, let's get to know each other.

339
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,287
Hi!

340
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:43,958
I'm Nicole, 18, from Pacaque!

341
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:54,218
Tony, 26. Manila.

342
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:56,470
Hi.

343
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:58,222
Hi.

344
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:19,066
Fuck this life!

345
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,599
Rafael?

346
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,574
This is what I fear the most.

347
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,382
If it was just a fistfight,

348
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,385
I can fight with you.

349
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,638
But when it comes to love,

350
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:24,767
I don't know what to tell you.

351
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,577
It's okay, Pops.

352
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:29,720
You don't have to say anything.

353
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,111
You know,

354
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:39,355
back in the day,

355
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,692
no one taught us

356
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,654
how to raise a...

357
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:49,696
a kid

358
00:21:50,658 --> 00:21:51,909
like you.

359
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:54,922
But...

360
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,549
when you came into my life,

361
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,430
you were the one who taught me how.

362
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,225
It wasn't that hard after all.

363
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:10,177
You're so easy to love.

364
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:15,474
When I think about it,

365
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,601
you took after me.

366
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:22,064
Because you give so much love.

367
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:24,267
And you're a fighter.

368
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,514
You're the best, Pops.

369
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:31,574
If you want,

370
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:34,201
I'll ask my men to find

371
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,829
whoever made you cry.

372
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:15,739
Are you hungry?

373
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,498
Can we talk?

374
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:49,995
I chose to...

375
00:23:53,572 --> 00:23:55,417
hide it from you because

376
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,130
I don't want you to think that

377
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:03,551
we don't matter to your dad anymore.

378
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,221
I didn't want you

379
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:09,723
to feel distant to your dad but...

380
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,059
it's my fault, dear.

381
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,978
Because I kept it a secret.

382
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:19,316
Your dad hasn't sent money for a while now.

383
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,403
So I had to work twice as hard at school.

384
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:26,073
But I didn't notice that

385
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,702
I ended up neglecting you.

386
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:33,946
I'm sorry, my dear.

387
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:42,060
Are you happy, Ma?

388
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,263
- No. I wasn't a good mom.
- Ma.

389
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:53,434
Are you happy?

390
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:56,562
With Sir Dax?

391
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,180
I stoppped seeing him.

392
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:03,277
- For you. So you can forgive me.
- Ma, please.

393
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,738
You still haven't answered my question.

394
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:10,993
Are you happy when you're with Sir Dax?

395
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,804
Do you love him?

396
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:26,999
I'm just...

397
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:27,900
Ma.

398
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:47,746
Rafael,

399
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,440
I'm so proud of you.

400
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,736
Even though I know that

401
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,655
you don't play basketball.

402
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:07,623
So what’s his name?

403
00:26:08,874 --> 00:26:09,885
Shaquille--

404
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,514
Shaquille O'Lebron?

405
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,256
Shaquille--

406
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,519
Shaquille O'Jordan?

407
00:26:19,635 --> 00:26:20,636
It doesn't matter.

408
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,108
Let's not force it.

409
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,886
You're still the greatest teacher

410
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,723
and mother for me.

411
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,731
I won't ask for anything else
but your happiness.

412
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:07,577
Love you.

413
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:15,993
Ma.

414
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,078
What now, Pops?

415
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:45,689
Fifi vs. Popsy?

416
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:48,067
Sure.

417
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:51,236
My favorite dish,

418
00:27:51,435 --> 00:27:52,446
beef stew.

419
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,506
Mine...

420
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:55,424
marinated pork.

421
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:57,367
- Marinated pork?
- Yup.

422
00:27:57,566 --> 00:27:59,178
My favorite color,

423
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:00,053
blue.

424
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:03,130
That's why you're wearing blue.
Mine is red.

425
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:04,239
- Red?
- Red.

426
00:28:04,239 --> 00:28:06,158
My favorite subject...

427
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:07,409
math.

428
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:10,172
And that

429
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:14,468
is my favorite song.

430
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:20,964
Okay. Let me show you how it's done!

431
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,401
How?

432
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:25,319
Like this.

433
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:27,956
Move it! This ain't robotics.

434
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,640
Give respect to budots.

435
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:30,599
Like this.

436
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:31,752
Tongue out.

437
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:35,562
And, Ma.

438
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:39,159
If it happens again next time...

439
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,155
please don't leave your underwear
in the classroom.

440
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:11,500
Hey!

441
00:29:12,914 --> 00:29:13,752
Wow!

442
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:15,477
Good job!

443
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:17,204
Is that your gorilla move?

444
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:19,908
1-0 Popsy! 1-0!

445
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:20,736
One.

446
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:22,673
Scoop!

447
00:29:27,573 --> 00:29:30,033
When they say count your lucky stars,

448
00:29:30,325 --> 00:29:31,545
On the floor, like this!

449
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,923
you end up believing
that everything will be okay.

450
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:37,916
MY MOM AND I MADE UP!!!

451
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,251
JEFF MIGHT NOT LOVE ME
BUT AT LEAST MY DAD DOES!

452
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:40,168
I’LL TELL MY STORY TOMORROW!

453
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:44,828
I THOUGHT MY MOM
FINALLY UNDERSTANDS ME

454
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:48,885
BUT APPARENTLY SHE DOESN’T.

455
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:50,439
Lord God,

456
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:53,108
please help us.

457
00:29:57,686 --> 00:29:58,812
I'm pregnant, Ma.

458
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:00,574
Not possessed.

459
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,859
That everything's going to be fine

460
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:06,612
because you've already been
through the worst.

461
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,083
That's life, my dear.

462
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,045
It’s God's gift of life.

463
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:15,964
We need to take care of it.

464
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,514
Don't worry,

465
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:19,374
God will help us.

466
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:23,545
I don't even know what to do.

467
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,268
That's why I'm here.

468
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,437
To guide you, my dear.

469
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,606
Mom is always here for you, okay?

470
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,403
You'll believe anything
that gives you peace of mind.

471
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:43,367
I was also like you when I got pregnant.

472
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:46,821
I was so scared.

473
00:30:48,523 --> 00:30:50,165
I didn't know what to do.

474
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:52,866
I didn't know how the world works.

475
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:56,713
But with God's grace, my dear,

476
00:30:57,685 --> 00:30:59,549
I was able to raise you well.

477
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:04,429
I don't regret having you.

478
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,893
You are my greatest blessing
from the Lord God.

479
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,024
You got pregnant early.

480
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:18,235
Dad left us.

481
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:26,451
Don't say that, dear.

482
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:33,166
Be thankful you still have
a parent who cares for you.

483
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,129
You have teachers to guide you.

484
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,173
I didn't want this to happen.

485
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,134
I didn't want to get pregnant.

486
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:46,221
You're just tired.

487
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:48,338
You don't mean what you're saying.

488
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:51,143
Please. Be thankful, not spiteful.

489
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,916
Ma’am.

490
00:32:40,849 --> 00:32:43,945
You arrived early. Come in.

491
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,127
What are you doing here?

492
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:02,297
Diana, your mom called me.

493
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:05,717
She told me you’re ready
to talk about our baby

494
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:07,344
and our wedding.

495
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,648
Count your lucky stars.

496
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:23,985
But...

497
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:28,407
What if there are no stars left
for you to count?

498
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:40,460
I'll take responsibility for what happened.

499
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,037
Praise the Lord God!

500
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,982
I don't want to push through
with the pregnancy.

501
00:33:46,081 --> 00:33:49,084
Why do you like that P-H-I-E more?

502
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:52,712
Can't you accept my fi...
my feelings for you?

503
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:55,440
It's not you, it's me.

504
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:58,176
What does my mom mean to you?
Just the other woman?

505
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,870
Ma, this is my body.
My body, my rules.

506
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:05,483
When I say you're not doing it,
you have no choice but to obey.

507
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:07,003
Diana!

508
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,948
Diana, let's go!
