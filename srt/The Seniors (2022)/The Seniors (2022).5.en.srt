1
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,280
I want you to put Fifi in the star section.

2
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:31,881
You can go on with "The Certifieds."

3
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:32,907
As for us...

4
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,702
- We are--
- We are the-- The Verifieds.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,886
- Super? Super!
- Ya see? Super!

6
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,473
And to all the teachers,
we have gifts for you.

7
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,459
There's no one in this world

8
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,086
that I look up to

9
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,128
except for you.

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
Time for our surprise!

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,800
- The Panty Droppin' Award!
- Yes!

12
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,068
Get the juice.

13
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,403
Poor kids. They must be so tired.

14
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,554
I'll take this too.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,431
Preggies can be picky.

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,849
Who's preggy?

17
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:58,809
Huh?

18
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:00,477
Then in just one click,

19
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,607
the whole world will know
your dirty little secret.

20
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:18,203
What's this?

21
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,163
Lost and found.

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,873
Who's this?

23
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,338
What the hell? It stinks.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,216
Duh, it's a fart.
Did you expect to smell perfume?

25
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,409
Excuse me.

26
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,745
Where are you going?

27
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:37,557
You stink!

28
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:39,266
As human beings,

29
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,976
it's normal to lose stuff.

30
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,002
Wait up!

31
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,506
But not lace panties.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,549
Wait up!

33
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,325
Diana!

34
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,747
Jennifer...

35
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,669
Why are you Sir Dax's favorite?

36
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,670
Why do you care?

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,298
You have a lot to explain.

38
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:13,133
Give me that.

39
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,468
- Give it to me.
- No.

40
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:15,820
Wait,

41
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:18,722
is that the panty from the chat room?

42
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:20,932
Mind your own business!

43
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,645
You already ruined my plans earlier.
Now, you wanna ruin my night too?

44
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:25,646
Hey!

45
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,424
My twinnie ain't doing anything wrong.
It's you who's being a bitch here.

46
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:32,230
Wait, what's going on?

47
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:34,696
It's Diana.

48
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,822
Such a busybody
who keeps running her mouth.

49
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,224
At least I don't do it with older men.

50
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,663
What are you trying to say?
Whatever it is,

51
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:43,789
it's fake news.

52
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:44,831
- Give me that.
- No.

53
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,749
- Give it!
- No.

54
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,067
Give it to me!

55
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,336
- Jen--
- What the?!

56
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:51,783
What the hell?!

57
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:52,767
Hey!

58
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:56,718
It's also normal for people to find
the things you lost.

59
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,411
Move.

60
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:02,040
Except maybe for
a panty with the initials...

61
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:03,782
JD?

62
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:05,394
Jennifer?

63
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:06,895
Dimaculangan?

64
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,589
Yuck! That's yours?

65
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:12,807
You fucking stink!

66
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,304
Jennifer.

67
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,515
Whatever it is you're doing with him,
I'm telling you now,

68
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,210
- it's not gonna end well.
- Stop speaking English!

69
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:21,827
Jen...

70
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,203
you're still a minor.

71
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,288
Please, just stop it!

72
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,457
I just don't want you to end up
like me, okay?

73
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,875
I don't want you ruining your life

74
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,193
because of sex.

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,047
Hey, girl! How's it going?

76
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,757
I can't hear anything.

77
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:38,345
I know, okay?
I know this is a bit confusing.

78
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,261
But trust me.

79
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,912
I felt it once too.

80
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,498
I just don't want you to end up like me.

81
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,251
- Like what?
- Knocked up by the wrong person.

82
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,394
Okay?

83
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,603
You're pregnant?

84
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:51,857
You're not a virgin?

85
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,799
Hey!

86
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:54,926
This is not about me.

87
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,928
Okay. Don't you get it?

88
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,056
I'm warning you.

89
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:02,976
Maybe he's just grooming you
because that's what pedophiles do.

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,703
Jennifer, I'll help you.

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,871
We'll help you.

92
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:08,315
- We'll report Sir Dax to...
- Wait. Wait.

93
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:09,958
Jen?

94
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:12,252
And Sir Dax?

95
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,696
So that's why you're Sir Dax's favorite!

96
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:16,923
No.

97
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,467
Wait. Hold on.

98
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,760
- That's not--
- Yes.

99
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,428
Yeah.

100
00:04:21,807 --> 00:04:23,455
I caught them the other night.

101
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:26,391
And sooner or later
the whole school will know.

102
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,809
Jen, I'm telling you.

103
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,340
Why didn't you tell me?

104
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,067
Jen...

105
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,514
Jen, you have to stop
this nonsense with Sir Dax.

106
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,892
We'll help you. Promise.

107
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,602
Jen...

108
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:53,944
Jennifer!

109
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,327
What are we doing here?

110
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:32,707
Can we stop first? I need to go to
the bathroom. I can't hold it in.

111
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:35,877
You know what,

112
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,197
- let's go back. Let's just go home.
- No, we're already here.

113
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,624
Diana, I really can't--

114
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:50,806
Shut up.

115
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,107
I can feel it coming.

116
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,471
Save your energy.

117
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,579
Let's do it again.

118
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,621
Aren't you tired?

119
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,039
I'm all fired up.

120
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:14,974
Let's just go.

121
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,919
Are you there yet, babe?

122
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,006
- Wait a sec.
- I'm getting all sweaty here.

123
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:26,041
Move! I really need to go poop.

124
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,090
Shit! Jennifer--

125
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,733
Shit!

126
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,626
Let's go.

127
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,515
Where is she?

128
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,696
Jennifer! I really have to go.

129
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:17,098
In that moment,

130
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:20,006
- The Certifieds realized two things.
- Jen?

131
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:22,634
Jennifer?

132
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,595
Jennifer? Are you there?

133
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,780
- One,
- Jennifer!

134
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,658
some things are better lost

135
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,934
than found.

136
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:32,602
Jennifer!

137
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:35,872
- Two,
- What a pity.

138
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,458
why are bathrooms in Pacaque too far?

139
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,128
- Pity your ass.
- Let's find Jennifer first.

140
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,989
Jen? Jennifer?

141
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,596
Jennifer,

142
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,477
you know I get scared pretty easily.

143
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,871
Jennifer!

144
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,480
Fuck, Fifi!

145
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,173
It's so stinky!

146
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:03,775
Can't you just--

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,592
hold it in?

148
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,194
Just five more minutes.

149
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,179
Hold it in!

150
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:08,430
How?

151
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:11,224
Fuck, it smells so fucking bad.

152
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,410
Hold it in. Can you just--

153
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:16,813
- ...be a few steps away.
- There. You happy?

154
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,235
What a brat.

155
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,595
DID YOU FIND HER?

156
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,671
This is my fault.

157
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:53,141
Jennifer's gonna come back. Don't worry.

158
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,140
Maybe--

159
00:08:55,855 --> 00:08:58,355
maybe she just needs some time to think.

160
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:00,654
She's right.

161
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:03,151
Your daughter can be pretty mean

162
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:05,278
but she's still our friend.

163
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:08,214
Don't worry, Ma'am Jemma.
I'll ask Pops...

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,576
to help us find Jennifer.

165
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:13,816
Thank you.

166
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:23,987
Ma'am Jemma.

167
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,137
Yes?

168
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:26,983
I'm really sorry

169
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,710
but I've been holding this for too long.

170
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,362
Can I use your bathroom?

171
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,658
Sorry, girl.

172
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:34,783
What?

173
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:38,136
Sorry.

174
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,673
There you are.

175
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,819
Girl, it's okay.

176
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,434
Just let it all out.

177
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:21,980
No one's looking.

178
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,303
But girl,

179
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,404
when you're done
and you're feeling okay, just tell me.

180
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:31,779
I'll take you home.

181
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,710
I don't want to. I can't go home yet.

182
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,254
What?

183
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:48,882
Where do you plan to go?

184
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,847
I don't know.

185
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,429
Maybe if only--

186
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,060
if I can find

187
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,480
some place to stay.

188
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,150
A friend's house, perhaps?

189
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,446
Someone kind enough...

190
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,657
to take me in...

191
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,495
while I'm having a hard time.

192
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:27,214
Even just for a few days.
I just really don't want to go home.

193
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:33,593
A couple of days will do.

194
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,366
Hey.

195
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:41,768
Hey, girl.

196
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,561
Are you asleep?

197
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,707
Well, you said you didn't want to go home.

198
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:48,833
I know!

199
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,777
Let's ask Diana for help.

200
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:52,570
She's from Manila, right?

201
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:54,964
I'm sure she knows a lot of--

202
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,990
No.

203
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:57,951
And besides,

204
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,912
she has other things to worry about.

205
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,956
Plus, we aren't that close.

206
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,959
Where will you stay then?

207
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:07,836
At Fifi's?

208
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,004
Don't you get it?

209
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:12,966
It's only the two of us here.
Maybe I can stay with you.

210
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,386
Sorry.

211
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,321
At your place, if it's alright.

212
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:23,142
I don't want to force anybody.
I just really don't want to go home.

213
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,354
If it's just okay with you.

214
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,941
Sure, you can stay with us.

215
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:33,945
But tell your mom, okay?

216
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:35,822
I don't want to.

217
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,426
Alright, just stay at our house.
I'll tell my mom

218
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:44,330
to prepare your clothes and food.

219
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:47,959
It's okay. Cry it all out.

220
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,490
Don't be shy, Jenny.

221
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:05,143
Bring some food home for your mom.

222
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:09,122
Ma,

223
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,613
Jen is going to stay here again later.

224
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:14,933
We're going to finish a project.

225
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,407
Why not stay at Jennifer's so Ma'am Jemma
can help you out?

226
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,327
She's busy with her other man--

227
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,348
--mandatory seminars.

228
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:31,210
All the teachers are required to attend.

229
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:35,194
- Alright. I'll call your siblings.
- Okay, Ma.

230
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,094
Eat a lot, okay?

231
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:43,848
Let's just wait for them.

232
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,865
Engaged!

233
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,572
Fifi...

234
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,079
love...

235
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:07,705
Rafael!

236
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:09,916
You have a guest.

237
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:12,752
Who is it?

238
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,254
A member from your basketball team.

239
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,788
Right, Pops.

240
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:20,885
That's my friend.

241
00:14:21,516 --> 00:14:23,805
Wait up. I'll just freshen up.

242
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,121
Fifi...

243
00:14:32,146 --> 00:14:33,272
love...

244
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,782
Jeff.

245
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:38,572
Will you marry me?

246
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,599
Yes, I do!

247
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,326
Rafael!

248
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:48,936
What's taking you so long?
Your guest is waiting outside!

249
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:53,918
Jeff, I appreciate that
you're asking for permission.

250
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,712
Of course, sir.

251
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,737
It's for us anyway.

252
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:03,386
Just make sure you get home before curfew.

253
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,320
Yes, sir.

254
00:15:04,484 --> 00:15:07,724
I'll make sure to take good care of him.

255
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,585
Alright.

256
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:10,864
Nice.

257
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:14,556
Thank you for letting us use
the court, Chief!

258
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:16,605
- Chief! Chief! Chief!
- What?

259
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,068
- Chief! It's about Vicky's kid!
- What about?

260
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:20,760
He fell through the sewer again?

261
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:21,796
No, sir.

262
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,146
Then what?

263
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:24,991
Have you seen him?

264
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,550
Dumbass.

265
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:29,349
I should be asking you!
Let's go. Let's look.

266
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,651
This kid always goes missing.

267
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,149
Ma, do you think I can
handle the responsibility?

268
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,343
You? Of course!

269
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:26,969
You can do it.

270
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,521
Take care! Bye. I love you.

271
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,366
- Please get home safe. Love you!
- Love you!

272
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,936
Ma, thank you for inspiring us.

273
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:37,149
You are my pride and joy, Ma.

274
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:41,192
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too.

275
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,438
Have you tried climbing here?

276
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,791
Dumbass!

277
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:08,381
Don't point your fingers! They say there's
a spirit living in that tree.

278
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,045
Really?

279
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,239
Yes! Here, bite your fingers. Like this.

280
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,200
- All of it.
- Then?

281
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:16,994
And then you go back home.

282
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,164
You're so annoying.

283
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,500
Hey.

284
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:23,584
Sorry.

285
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,944
But...

286
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,111
Thank you, really.

287
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:36,622
No worries.

288
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,295
Alright, cut the drama.

289
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,672
As if I have a choice?

290
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,900
I'm kidding.

291
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:48,968
That's a joke.

292
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:51,929
Just promise...

293
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:55,308
that you'll go home once you're okay.

294
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:58,160
Hey.

295
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:00,586
One moment.

296
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:04,765
It's Anton.

297
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:07,440
TRIPLE DATE LATER WITH THE GUYS
AND THEIR GIRLS. EED SOME LOVING. CARPS?

298
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:08,466
Carps?

299
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,464
What does that mean?

300
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,532
As in the fish?

301
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,035
Maybe it means carpet.

302
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,721
Are we going to have sex on a carpet?

303
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,623
You're so gross.

304
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:20,725
Girl...

305
00:18:21,471 --> 00:18:22,893
can you come with me?

306
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,005
It's my first time meeting his friends.

307
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm nervous.

308
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,762
You're going without even knowing
what ‘carps' mean.

309
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,472
Are you sure

310
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:37,141
you know what you're getting into?

311
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:40,928
Or he's the one getting into me?

312
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,247
Watch your mouth!

313
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:44,621
You'll never know.

314
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,001
Have you done it?

315
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:50,295
Like I said,

316
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,032
I'm still waiting for the perfect moment.

317
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:54,788
When I turn eighteen.

318
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,327
Just be sure

319
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,641
you'll be responsible for it.

320
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,462
So girl, are you coming?

321
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,275
Hell no.

322
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,766
I still don't even know what 'carps' mean.

323
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:06,999
Besides,

324
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:09,385
I'd rather have my date here.

325
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,175
With the spirit in this tree.
I'll find him.

326
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,595
Who knows, maybe you can
find a cute guy there.

327
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:16,405
No, thanks.

328
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,517
- Come on, it's fun to have a love life.
- At this state I'm in? Really?

329
00:19:19,746 --> 00:19:21,060
Okay.

330
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:23,187
I'll go on my own then.

331
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:33,455
Ready, babe?

332
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,413
Let's go.

333
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,495
Boys!

334
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,064
- Hey!
- Yo!

335
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,440
Meet my new girl.

336
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,175
- This is Nicole.
- Different girl again, I see.

337
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:54,527
No, bro.

338
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:55,945
She's the one.

339
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:59,115
Wait, let's drink to that.

340
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,016
Babe,

341
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,057
can you dance for me?

342
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:05,315
I'm shy.

343
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,190
Come on, babe. For us?

344
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,030
Okay.

345
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,353
- Let's dance.
- Go, babe!

346
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:56,552
Drink up!

347
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,131
Shot! Shot!

348
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,383
Shot?

349
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:01,694
Shot!

350
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,809
It tastes bad!

351
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,018
- Are you alright?
- It's bitter.

352
00:21:14,811 --> 00:21:15,729
Babe.

353
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,605
I'm so lucky to have you.

354
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:22,843
I'm tired, babe.

355
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:25,868
Are you okay?

356
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,452
Just tired.

357
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,870
So lucky to have you.

358
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,310
Thank you.

359
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,318
C'mon, bro, drink up!

360
00:21:34,482 --> 00:21:35,525
Cheers! Cheers!

361
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,378
- Here, babe. Have a shot.
- Okay.

362
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,803
Cheers! Cheers!

363
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:42,389
Cheers!

364
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:43,235
Cheers!

365
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,553
- Bottoms up.
- It's bitter.

366
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:51,474
Drink some more!

367
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,938
Drink up, we have a lot.

368
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:02,847
She's hot, bro.

369
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,896
Small tits, though.

370
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,906
I'm good with small tits

371
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,244
but nice ass.

372
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,187
Point taken.

373
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,205
But here's a legit question.

374
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:13,499
Would you still hit that after she pukes?

375
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:15,665
Of course!

376
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,528
A pussy is still a pussy.

377
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,421
Even if she's drunk.

378
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:20,822
Still good as fuck.

379
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,716
But I won't kiss her though.

380
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:25,423
- Fuck, bro. That's nasty as fuck.
- Fuck you, man.

381
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:26,701
You'll just jerk off?

382
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:28,117
Yup!

383
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,423
I can go from here, babe.

384
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,366
I'll just walk home.

385
00:22:39,747 --> 00:22:40,985
Thank you.

386
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,028
Can I get one more kiss?

387
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:50,840
I feel like

388
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,481
this is the right time to tell you that

389
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:55,024
you're the one for me.

390
00:22:56,823 --> 00:22:59,111
I want to do it with the right person.

391
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:07,870
Wait.

392
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,248
I thought we'll wait until my birthday?

393
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,771
You said

394
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:19,556
that you love me, right?

395
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:20,633
Super.

396
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:22,735
Isn't it that

397
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,345
if you love someone,

398
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:25,846
you want the person to be happy?

399
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,259
Yes.

400
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:31,201
Then make this sad boy happy.

401
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:32,436
What?

402
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:34,396
You're sad?

403
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,694
Not anymore if we do it now.

404
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,901
I really want to be with you.

405
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:45,366
Do you want to be with me too?

406
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,925
Yes.

407
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,202
Super.

408
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,418
Wait.

409
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:03,759
It's okay.

410
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:06,095
I don't want you to worry.

411
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,749
It's just that...

412
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,749
it's my first time.

413
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,460
And believe me,

414
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,249
you're doing it with the right person.

415
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,851
Don't worry about it.

416
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,991
This is just one of the many things
that we're going to do together.

417
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,101
Okay?

418
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:34,343
We got this, babe.

419
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:36,788
Okay.

420
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,011
Okay, let's do it.

421
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:53,770
Babe...

422
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:56,096
Babe, we're here.

423
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,850
Where are we?

424
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,044
In Sta. Lucia.

425
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,713
I can't let people see my car in Pacaque.

426
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:06,273
My dad will kill me.

427
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:08,525
Let's go.

428
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:09,677
Okay.

429
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:01,437
It stinks.

430
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,337
TV!

431
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,265
Shit, shit, shit!

432
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:57,159
Wait!

433
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:58,880
Now?

434
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,448
- Get on with it.
- No kiss?

435
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,357
That's it?

436
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,544
Is this it?

437
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,779
It is, right?

438
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:55,717
As they say,

439
00:28:56,338 --> 00:29:00,347
you find the things you lose
when you least expect them.

440
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:04,935
In Nicole's case,

441
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,812
Expectation?

442
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:08,605
Lost.

443
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,264
Reality?

444
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,735
Found.

445
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:30,269
Our BFF needs help.

446
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:36,483
I imagined my first sex to be magical,
only for him to finish in five minutes.

447
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,527
His dick doesn't even come close
to an inch.

448
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,070
We have something for you.

449
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,764
This is extreme booze.

450
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:44,449
Are you ready to get wasted tonight?

451
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,659
Ready!

452
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:49,836
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

453
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:52,040
He's just a boy with a small dick.

454
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:56,128
Let's go, girls!

455
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,008
Let's go!

456
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:03,802
Shit, look at this.

457
00:30:06,358 --> 00:30:08,765
Please report to
the principal's office immediately.
