1
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,067
They’re here!

2
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:26,994
What! Where?

3
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:37,746
Scram.

4
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:38,747
Huh?

5
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,498
And why?

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,126
Don’t you know us?

7
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,545
Should I know you?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,854
Hey, come on!

9
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,823
Get outta there!
Let’s go!

10
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,591
Why would I?

11
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,927
They're "The Certifieds."
Come on!

12
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,219
Certifieds?

13
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,221
Do I have to repeat myself? Let’s go!

14
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:00,544
I said scram!

15
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:07,609
Hey, cutie!

16
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,028
Can you please take our video?

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,321
- Sure.
- Make us look extra good.

18
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,072
Sure do.

19
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:12,890
Make sure of it.

20
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,349
What’s that?

21
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:48,443
Left-handed people is meant
to be lucky this year!

22
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,045
Oh my gosh!

23
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,299
Something is telling me that this year
is going to be different.

24
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,050
But is it legit?

25
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:57,010
Legit?

26
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,570
It has to be legit.

27
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,180
I saw it on Facebook.

28
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,474
Plus, I have a feeling something
is going to change this school year.

29
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,767
Whatever it is, I’ll go with it.

30
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,853
Girl.

31
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,439
Sorry to break your bubble
but we’re in Pacaque.

32
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,941
Nothing new ever happens here.

33
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,651
You're no fun.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,129
I don’t know about you two, but for me,

35
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,617
I’m super excited to
graduate and study in Manila.

36
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:25,038
Anton has a condo unit there
and I’m free to stay there if I want.

37
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,209
You’re moving in with Anton?

38
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,320
It’s for educational purposes.

39
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:34,156
Plus, it’s a two-bedroom unit.

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,964
Girl.

41
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,969
Two people don’t live
together just to study.

42
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,350
Well... that includes that too, right?

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,395
And by that time,
I shouldn’t be a virgin, right?

44
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,940
- Yuck.
- Ew.

45
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:54,301
As for me,

46
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,879
I'm gonna focus on my studies

47
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,947
and graduate.

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,058
Then, I can finally be
a teacher in Pacaque.

49
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,283
Just like my mom.

50
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,185
Wow.

51
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,928
Congrats in advance.

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,899
All you guys talk about is the future.
Future! Future! Future!

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,442
What if

54
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,027
we live in the now?

55
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,212
- Mindanao?
- Dumbass, in the now!

56
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,546
Oh my goodness.

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,381
Whatever.

58
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,593
All I know is our senior year
will be pretty eventful.

59
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,679
I feel it.

60
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:24,956
I like it.

61
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,141
I want it.

62
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,794
I got it.

63
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,130
Like Jeff?

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,084
Shut up!

65
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,527
- Don’t you just miss your Jeffyboo!
- Shut up!

66
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,867
Wait until I get my hands on Anton.
You'll regret it.

67
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,188
Why involve Anton here? Excuse me?

68
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:52,484
Change.

69
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,630
The measure of intelligence
is the ability to change.

70
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:02,510
At least according to Albert Einstein,
a famous scientist.

71
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:25,767
Dear...

72
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,619
are you coming with me to school?

73
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,997
I'm good, Nicole will pick me up.

74
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,790
Okay, the both of you take care.

75
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:34,839
By the way,

76
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,422
good luck on your first day
as student council president.

77
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,410
Ma, but do you think
I can handle the responsibilities?

78
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,553
I'm a bit scared.

79
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,705
You, scared?

80
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:48,986
You don’t know how brave you are.

81
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:51,966
I thought you got it from me?

82
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,227
Of course!

83
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,147
And that’s why you always inspire me.

84
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:58,800
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you too.

85
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm going now.

86
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:01,444
Now I have lipstick on my face.

87
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,695
That makes the two of us.

88
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,737
Bye.

89
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,656
- Take care.
- Okay.

90
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,915
Change.

91
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,710
Change is the only constant thing in life.

92
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,575
This time, according to Heraclitus,

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,185
a Greek philosopher.

94
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:34,894
Perfect!

95
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:55,707
Ma!

96
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:58,309
Nicole, you’re going to be late!

97
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,520
And why do I hear loud sounds
from your room?

98
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,254
Huh?

99
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:03,436
What? I didn’t hear anything.

100
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,492
Alright. Get out of bed now!

101
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,019
Okay, Ma.

102
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,323
Ma, is—

103
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,681
—the tricycle ready?

104
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:14,428
I need to pick up Jennifer and Fifi.

105
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,139
Okay, I'll tell your dad.

106
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:18,206
Okay, Ma.

107
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,341
I've loved you all along.

108
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,009
Change?

109
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:32,821
Change?

110
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:33,895
Here's your change.

111
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,857
Keep the change.

112
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,037
Yes, I will.

113
00:07:40,062 --> 00:07:41,396
You’re such a freeloader.

114
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:43,029
Ah, yes!

115
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,990
Keep the change.

116
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:46,835
That's according to Fifi.

117
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,051
Gay.

118
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:53,325
Star player of Pacaque Rural High School's
volleyball team.

119
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,035
Girl!

120
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:56,928
- Let's go!
- Girl!

121
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:59,222
It’s about time!
I’ve been burning here for so long.

122
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:02,667
Well, Nicole’s been touching herself.

123
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:04,269
Shut up!

124
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,671
Your slow ass also got us late.

125
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:07,731
I don’t care about anyone’s asses.

126
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:09,941
The heat is burning my face and my ass!

127
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:11,658
Thank you, Madam Ning.

128
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:12,944
By the way,

129
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,738
have you seen the views
on our dance video?

130
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,563
We got a lot!

131
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,016
Seventy-six views.

132
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:19,351
That’s a lot?

133
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:23,038
That’s already a lot in the standards
of Brgy. Pacaque.

134
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:24,831
Out of the 76 views,

135
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,542
I bet 70 came from you.

136
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:28,502
Girl, no.

137
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,211
Look,

138
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,504
TikTok says

139
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:34,032
that six of those views came from Manila.

140
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,075
We are famous!

141
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:38,268
People will recognize us at the train
so we better get bodyguards.

142
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:41,932
Our lives have been forever changed
because of that dance!

143
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,808
Look!

144
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:43,975
Stop spouting nonsense.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,650
I will change your face if we run late.

146
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:47,170
So, let's go!

147
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,803
Let's go!

148
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,190
Excuse me, Madam President.

149
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,443
Will the student government have a meeting

150
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:12,028
for the programs this school year, Madam?

151
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:12,838
Yes.

152
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,823
Make sure all officers are present later.

153
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:16,074
Okay, Madam President.

154
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:17,165
Thank you, madam.

155
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,286
- Hi, Nicole.
- Hi.

156
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:20,454
You want some pandesal?

157
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:22,080
Do I look like I eat pandesal?

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,937
Of course.

159
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,000
Sorry, I'm on a diet.

160
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,044
Hi, Fifi! Join us for
volleyball after class?

161
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:28,753
No.

162
00:09:29,212 --> 00:09:30,981
Why? They seem cool.

163
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:33,550
Nicole, I’m not just a cool gay.
I am gay because I’m a star.

164
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,676
A Star Gay!

165
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:38,013
- I only make friends with star students.
- Okay.

166
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:40,724
Hi, Fifi.

167
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:44,644
Hi, Jeff.

168
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,487
You have practice later, right?

169
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,241
Yeah, I think so.

170
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,278
So I guess I’ll see you later?

171
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,839
How sweet of you.

172
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,039
You're going with me to practice?

173
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:02,204
We train at the same place and time.

174
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,921
Wow, it must be des—

175
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,217
—tiny, right?

176
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:12,964
Huh?

177
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:14,591
Hug?

178
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,898
We only have one court in school.

179
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:27,938
So,

180
00:10:28,146 --> 00:10:28,939
see you?

181
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,565
See you.

182
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,193
Bye, Jeff.

183
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:36,970
Jeff!

184
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,164
I thought

185
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,994
you only make friends
with star students?

186
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:46,414
Jeff for me is a star. Even if he's not
from the star section.

187
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:48,833
Oh, really? Okay.

188
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,212
Jeff!

189
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:53,797
Come on, let’s go!

190
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,048
Flirt!

191
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,490
Can I help you?

192
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:22,909
That’s my seat.

193
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:27,205
I think you like me.

194
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:30,815
Excuse me?

195
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,009
- Have you seen yourself in the mirror?
- Huh?

196
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,504
Huh your dumbass.

197
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,518
Now, scram.

198
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,901
It's the first day of classes so
no seat assignments yet.

199
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,428
Boy, you don't get to decide.

200
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:42,936
As far as I know, you’re not new here.

201
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,434
In my four years here in Pacaque,

202
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:46,700
I'm right-handed.

203
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,735
But since I've posted on my social media
that I'll be left-handed this year,

204
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,081
you should have some common sense.

205
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,041
So scram! That's my seat.

206
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,043
I won't. I'm left-handed.

207
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:57,253
I'm left-handed too.

208
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,511
This year.

209
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,099
Are you gonna leave

210
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:11,851
or should I drag you out?

211
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:14,395
Oh, Fifi.

212
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:15,271
Now!

213
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:19,442
Burok,

214
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,944
switch the chairs

215
00:12:22,486 --> 00:12:24,155
and sit behind me.

216
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:36,083
Very good.

217
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:46,886
Ugh, it stinks.

218
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,558
Why do you have to be such a bully?

219
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,311
It always the ugly ones, right?

220
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,729
I know, right.

221
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:58,845
- You mean you?
- Huh?

222
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,025
"It's." It's always.

223
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,932
It can't be "eats", he's so skinny.

224
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:04,767
- "Eat" is right.
- Dumbass.

225
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,363
If only one "it."

226
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,656
If many "its."

227
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,200
You don’t have to correct me.

228
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:10,773
Agree.

229
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:14,705
Good morning, class.

230
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:16,123
Good morning, sir.

231
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:17,792
I'm your class adviser.

232
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,460
My name is Dax Tee Ten.

233
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,326
But you can call me Sir Dax.

234
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,009
Welcome to your first day.

235
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:31,931
You are the star section for senior high
here in Pacaque Rural High School.

236
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,099
Do you know what that means?

237
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,142
Yes!

238
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:38,103
We are the stars of Pacaque.

239
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,988
Only us. Certifieds!

240
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,431
Yes, Fifi. You're right.

241
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,569
In other words, you are
the cream of the crop.

242
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,478
So we expect very highly of you.

243
00:13:49,114 --> 00:13:52,827
We could only accommodate
18 of you in the class.

244
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:58,499
Sir Dax, what about the others?
Why just 18?

245
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:02,962
Apparently, the school had to cut down
its budget this year.

246
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,595
So we had to let go of ten slots.

247
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:08,717
As you can see,
you have AC unit in the classroom.

248
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,708
You have computer class.

249
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:12,304
Most of all,

250
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:16,141
you have a special but very useless vest.

251
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,358
Among other privileges, that is.

252
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,745
So please class,

253
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,939
consider yourself very lucky, okay?

254
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,065
Yes!

255
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,567
Exactly.

256
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:26,099
We are very lucky.

257
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:27,450
Rightfully so.

258
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:28,868
But Sir Dax,

259
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:32,575
the school year is just starting.

260
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,995
If we need more people to leave,
I'd gladly recommend someone.

261
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,454
If needed.

262
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,198
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

263
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:43,841
Anyway,

264
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:48,883
since it’s the first day, our first
order of business is to clean.

265
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:50,665
Yes, sir.

266
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,779
Excuse me.

267
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:00,705
Excuse your face.

268
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,248
Excuse me?

269
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,417
How about you get some cleaning done?

270
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,295
Why won’t you clean the windows.

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,906
Why won’t you clean your face?

272
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:12,058
You heard what Sir Dax said.

273
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,636
He told us to clean.

274
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,721
All of us! You're no exception!

275
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:19,474
Did you also hear what Sir Dax said?

276
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:23,169
- We are the cream of the crop.
- “We’re”, meaning all of us.

277
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,737
No, no, no. no.

278
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:25,789
No way.

279
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:28,858
Don't you know us?
We are The Certifieds.

280
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:30,318
We're TikTok-famous.

281
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:31,861
Haven’t you seen our TikTok?

282
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:32,749
Like I care.

283
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:33,817
Of course, you should!

284
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:34,755
Dumbass.

285
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,335
Homo.

286
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:38,254
What the hell did you say?

287
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,703
I said,

288
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,983
homo.

289
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,760
Say that again or I’ll burn you!

290
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:46,494
Homo!

291
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,197
Straight!

292
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:49,057
Homo!

293
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:50,338
Straight!

294
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:50,964
Homo!

295
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:51,673
Straight!

296
00:15:51,673 --> 00:15:53,967
Homo! Homo! Homo!

297
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:54,884
Suit yourselves.

298
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,052
Fifi. Emman.

299
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:57,796
Straight!

300
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:58,638
Homo!

301
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,056
- Straight! Straight!
- Fifi!

302
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,140
Enough.

303
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,414
Sir, you told us to clean
but they’re not even lifting a finger.

304
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:09,359
The rest of us have been cleaning
all this time.

305
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,288
Take your seats, I have an announcement.

306
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:14,028
Take your seat.

307
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:17,490
Class, I'd like you to meet
your newest classmate,

308
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:19,284
Diana Santos.

309
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,422
She’s a transferee from Manila.

310
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,344
Hi!

311
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:07,663
I'm Diana.

312
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:09,458
Jennifer,

313
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,543
can you give Diana a quick campus tour?

314
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,020
Just a quick tour.

315
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:17,298
Why me? Sir, why me?

316
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:18,371
Jennifer, please.

317
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:20,581
He can do it, sir.

318
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,784
I prefer you, Jennifer.

319
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,027
please.

320
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,436
Can’t she do it herself?

321
00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:33,780
Okay. Let's take a break, class.

322
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,318
That bitch!

323
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:40,214
Who does she think she is?
And it's only the first day of classes.

324
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:43,076
Maybe you're being too harsh on her.

325
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:44,867
She might be nice.

326
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:47,436
My dears, here are your take-outs.

327
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,760
Nice? More like a bitch.

328
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:54,045
Look at her, she looks like a bitch.

329
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:56,258
Well, maybe she isn’t.

330
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,375
But you know guys,

331
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,731
it takes one to know one. That’s all.

332
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:03,260
Whatever.

333
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,138
Oh my!

334
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:10,965
My boys are back in the yard. They even
brought milk tea with extra pearls.

335
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:13,938
Can’t blame them.

336
00:18:14,396 --> 00:18:16,106
Who can resist this?

337
00:18:26,582 --> 00:18:29,050
Hey. Are you trying to look threatening?

338
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:31,977
Or are you feeling threatened?

339
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,687
For real though.

340
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:37,274
I’m still figuring out
why she has to transfer here.

341
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:39,076
And immediately in the star section?

342
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,645
Just because she's from Manila?

343
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,655
From a private school?

344
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,115
True. It's not easy for anyone
to be part of the star section.

345
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,201
Why did she even have to move here?

346
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:49,734
I know.

347
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,123
- She’s a dumbass.
- Maybe.

348
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:54,750
Maybe she flunked her classes.

349
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,879
Lessons are more advanced in Manila, right?

350
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,879
So now, she’s the smart one here.

351
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,589
Or maybe she’s hiding something.

352
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,926
Maybe a scandal!

353
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:05,386
Correct.

354
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:06,762
Disgusting!

355
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:08,005
Anyway.

356
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,265
I don't care who she is.

357
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,519
But she needs to know who we are.

358
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:17,014
That we are The Certifieds.

359
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,900
- We are the stars!
- Damn right!

360
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:22,236
Pacaque is ours!

361
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:23,946
But you know what,

362
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:25,781
let's chill.

363
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,784
I'm pretty sure she already knows us.

364
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:32,705
And besides, we shouldn’t be
threatened by a Manila girl...

365
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:35,766
That bitch!

366
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,917
You're right!

367
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,078
She needs to know who we are.

368
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,630
She doesn’t yet.

369
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,382
What is it even about her?

370
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,593
What would a Certified do?

371
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:52,766
- Talk to her.
- Right!

372
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,560
You're no sissy, right?

373
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,811
Go!

374
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,700
Get moving.

375
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,640
- Fine.
- Can you go any slower?

376
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:02,901
Go, girl! Approach her.

377
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,278
Go, girl!

378
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,178
Nicole.

379
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,230
Are you even sure this is your perfume?

380
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,132
Yeah. I use it every day.

381
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,709
- Every day?
- Yes.

382
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,235
It stinks, Nicole.

383
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,595
Did you train earlier?

384
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,346
Train? We just got here!

385
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:32,723
Did you use deodorant?

386
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:36,026
Shut up! Jeff might hear you.

387
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,070
Don't go talking about deodorant out loud.

388
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:42,357
You two are really testing my patience.
Get your act together.

389
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,228
Hello.

390
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,239
Hi.

391
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,790
Do you know who we are,

392
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,158
Diana?

393
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:02,495
No, I actually don't.

394
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,340
But I know her. She gave me a tour earlier.

395
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,225
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

396
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:09,710
Jennylyn?

397
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:12,012
Jennifer.

398
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,024
- Right. Jennifer.
- Yeah.

399
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,270
Are you sure you don't know us?

400
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,273
A hundred percent sure.

401
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,895
Come on!

402
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,070
How pretentious. She's just acting
like she doesn't know us.

403
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,656
- But I'm sure she already stalked us.
- Correct!

404
00:21:31,053 --> 00:21:33,264
I just got here, right?

405
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:37,079
I really don't know you guys
and I'm sorry about that. I'm gonna go now.

406
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,080
No.

407
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:39,782
Formation, girls.

408
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,666
Five, six, seven, eight!

409
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,591
Looks familiar?

410
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:57,766
I'm sorry, I really don't know.

411
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,434
What are you guys doing?

412
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,762
We have viewers from Metro Manila.

413
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,031
I'm sure you're one of them.

414
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:06,775
You searched us before you moved here.

415
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:12,156
I'm sorry, I really don't know you guys.
I'm gonna go, okay?

416
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,190
No!

417
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,509
Stay here.

418
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:19,012
Since you don't know us, we're gonna
introduce ourselves.

419
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,706
We are The Certifieds.

420
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:22,791
Okay.

421
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,538
And this is Jennifer,
future batch valedictorian.

422
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,457
The smartest in Pacaque.

423
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:32,251
Yeah, she looks smart.

424
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,754
And this is Nicole.

425
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:37,548
Pacaque's beauty queen.

426
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,010
Yeah. She's pretty.

427
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,023
Yes!

428
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:48,483
And I...

429
00:22:55,115 --> 00:22:58,577
I am the epitome of beauty and brains.

430
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:02,156
Again.

431
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:09,755
I am the epitome of beauty and brains.

432
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,697
Okay.

433
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:13,842
I'm gonna go. We still have a class,
we're gonna be late. Let's go.

434
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,136
We just want you to know

435
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:20,774
that we are the queens of Pacaque.

436
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:25,979
And if you plan to play queen here
just because you're from Manila,

437
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,898
it’s not gonna happen.

438
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:30,192
Actually, I really don't have any plans to.

439
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,360
Oops!

440
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,153
You are not...

441
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,772
We're not yet done.

442
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:36,782
You are not...

443
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:39,777
You are is? Are?

444
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,336
Are.

445
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,996
You are...

446
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,499
You fucker!

447
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,927
You only get to talk when we're done, okay?

448
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:49,853
Okay, and?

449
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:51,455
We rule this campus.

450
00:23:51,713 --> 00:23:54,132
Every student here worships us.

451
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,092
And now,

452
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:56,635
that includes you.

453
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,909
You are our bitch!

454
00:23:58,934 --> 00:23:59,758
You get it?

455
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,016
You guys are so funny.

456
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,403
Okay, I really have to go now. I'm sorry.

457
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,596
No!

458
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:09,189
What?

459
00:24:09,189 --> 00:24:10,816
You are...

460
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:11,942
Shit!

461
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,735
Why do you keep on talking in English?

462
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:15,570
We have the same language in Manila!

463
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,782
We just want to make it clear that
we are the most powerful here.

464
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:21,535
And if you go against us,
you'll get in trouble.

465
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:23,342
And lastly,

466
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,447
stay away from my Jeff.

467
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,709
I'm so afraid.

468
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:31,003
But okay, you're so cute.

469
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:35,882
What a tough one.

470
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:36,883
Tough?

471
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,719
No, she was scared.

472
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:39,812
Success!

473
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,013
She said that

474
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,557
she's so afraid.

475
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,718
Stupid, it's sarcasm.

476
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,070
- Sarcasm?
- Yes.

477
00:24:48,228 --> 00:24:51,164
No. I know if it's sarcasm or not.

478
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,408
Really?

479
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,284
Aren't you a smart one?

480
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:56,537
Super.

481
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,281
Brainy.

482
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,118
Be thankful you're pretty.

483
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:05,504
Right.

484
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:07,892
You see this?

485
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:08,999
Say

486
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,134
"cute."

487
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,376
Cute.

488
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,087
That's right. Fierce.

489
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:16,715
I'll show her how to put blush on

490
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,976
with a lip tint.

491
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,094
Like that!

492
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,220
Yes.

493
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:25,899
I have a feeling her bag is fake.

494
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:28,685
It looks fake.

495
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,521
Diana. Do you want something
from the canteen?

496
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:34,499
Bottled water would be fine.

497
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:35,609
Sure, wait.

498
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,652
She really asked for something.

499
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,955
She really did.

500
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,998
Wow,

501
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:45,085
it's your first day
and you already feel at home.

502
00:25:45,494 --> 00:25:47,120
True! Correct!

503
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,797
Let's just make sure

504
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,166
she doesn't last long in the star section.

505
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,667
No way.

506
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:53,835
Class.

507
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,831
I have an announcement.

508
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,343
Since Diana will be part of this class,

509
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:05,981
I'm very sorry to say but one of you
will need to give up their slot.

510
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:09,434
Sir, I told you I have suggestions.

511
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,311
Actually, one or two.

512
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:12,112
Right?

513
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:13,647
Correct!

514
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:17,692
Actually, Fifi, I already talked
to the principal and he said

515
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:23,407
it’s based on last year’s average grades.

516
00:26:24,241 --> 00:26:25,283
So?

517
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,988
Let's hear it, sir! Who is it?

518
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,257
Fifi,

519
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,626
we're just going to tell
the student in private.

520
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:37,712
What private, Sir Dax?
We'll know it anyway.

521
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:38,964
Tell us, come on.

522
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,942
Fifi, it's for the student's privacy.

523
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,344
Privacy? You can tell us, Sir Dax.

524
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:45,362
It's you, Fifi.

525
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:46,930
It's me?

526
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:48,799
It's me?

527
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,935
You're going to be transferred. I'm sorry.

528
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:55,455
Are you joking, Sir Dax? Why me?

529
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,642
Actually, it's ready.
I got this from the principal.

530
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,787
The scores of all those in
the star section are here.

531
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,139
As you can see,

532
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:05,782
you got the lowest.

533
00:27:06,116 --> 00:27:07,284
But Sir Dax,

534
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:11,288
I win the most medals for this school.

535
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:14,749
Unfortunately, extra-curricular activities
are not counted

536
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:18,220
in determining who would make it
to the star section.

537
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,964
Actually, it's only valid
for honor students.

538
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,877
I'm very sorry too, Sir Dax,

539
00:27:25,402 --> 00:27:27,988
but I refuse to be transferred
to the lower section.

540
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:30,991
Sorry, I can't. I won't leave.

541
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,818
He's right, Sir Dax.

542
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,620
That’s unfair.

543
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:38,773
Just because she’s from Manila,

544
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,851
doesn’t mean she can take
someone else’s slot.

545
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:42,752
She's right, sir.

546
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:43,787
Jennifer,

547
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,814
you are the student council president.

548
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:47,858
You know the rules.

549
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:52,796
Diana has a very high average
from her previous school.

550
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,931
She was running for honors there.

551
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:56,508
Sorry, Fifi, but...

552
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,178
we're talking about average grades here.

553
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:00,245
Fifi,

554
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:04,194
I'll be the one to explain
to your parents, okay?

555
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:04,987
No!

556
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,490
You have nothing to explain to
my parents because I'm not leaving!

557
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,201
Are you gonna leave or
should I drag you out?

558
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:12,578
Can you do it?

559
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:14,079
You want me to try?

560
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,830
Go ahead!

561
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,749
Sure. Wait, let's try.

562
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:17,875
Put this on, okay?

563
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,253
Stupid, that's not how you do it!
Let me show you.

564
00:28:21,253 --> 00:28:23,172
- Like this!
- There.

565
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:26,508
- The other one.
- See, like this.

566
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:27,968
Let's go!

567
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:32,348
- Let me go!
- Emman!

568
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:33,057
That’s enough!

569
00:28:33,057 --> 00:28:34,350
Let go of me!

570
00:28:34,642 --> 00:28:35,893
Sir Dax!

571
00:28:36,052 --> 00:28:38,429
Nicole! Jennifer! Let me go!

572
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:40,010
Sorry.

573
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:42,066
Sorry?

574
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:42,592
Sir—

575
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:46,445
Curly, open the door!
Curly! Open this!

576
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,316
In that moment,

577
00:28:54,578 --> 00:28:56,844
Fifi realizes two things.

578
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:58,137
One,

579
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,168
change is really inevitable.

580
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:03,504
But this time,

581
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:06,674
he can't just keep the change
that is handed to him.

582
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:09,022
He needs to fight.

583
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:10,552
Second,

584
00:29:11,136 --> 00:29:13,806
his face looks horrible when it’s oily.

585
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:28,790
I'm going to crush you, Diana.

586
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:33,826
There you go!

587
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:35,994
You’re enjoying this, huh?

588
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,799
I'm not done!

589
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,050
Wait!

590
00:29:53,053 --> 00:29:54,304
Hi, Fifi.

591
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:56,348
No!

592
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:02,104
Fine!

593
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,314
I’m telling you!

594
00:30:04,314 --> 00:30:06,275
You're dead if that hits me!

595
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,405
Dia—

596
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:17,566
Diana!

597
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,375
RIGHT BEHAVIOR, WRONG GRAMMAR

598
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:24,848
SHOULD I TAG HER?!

599
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:27,229
LOWER SECTION! DUMB! DESERVING!

600
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:29,173
Diana, Diana, Diana.

601
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,593
Open the door. Open the door.
Open it!

602
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,028
You know,

603
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:38,515
it's only your first day but you've caused
a lot of changes already.

604
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,453
It's not my fault that your stupid friend's
kicked out from the star section.

605
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:43,479
Average grades are the basis—

606
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,646
Shut up!

607
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,167
Will you please open the door?

608
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:49,526
- No!
- Open it!

609
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:52,858
- Give up your slot in the star section!
- I won't.

610
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:55,616
Okay, you won't?

611
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,994
We'll make your life here
in Pacaque miserable.

612
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,604
You think I'm scared?

613
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,837
My life is already miserable.

614
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:10,352
I say,

615
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:11,757
bring it on.

616
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:13,914
And for the record,

617
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:17,693
I don't know you guys or your stupid clique
and I don't give a damn.

618
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:21,183
I'm here to study and graduate.

619
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,632
And I deserve that spot
in the star section.

620
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:27,536
And I want you to realize
using your miniscule brain

621
00:31:27,815 --> 00:31:28,720
that I'm not

622
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:29,888
going

623
00:31:29,983 --> 00:31:31,068
anywhere.

624
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,006
In that moment,

625
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,829
Nicole had a lot questions in her head.

626
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,554
Will Fifi ever be their classmate again?

627
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,766
Is this the end of The Certifieds?

628
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:53,145
Will Diana be their toughest enemy?

629
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,342
And,

630
00:31:54,675 --> 00:31:56,844
what does miniscule mean?

631
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:57,761
Nicole.

632
00:31:57,803 --> 00:31:59,972
Hey, my boob.

633
00:31:59,972 --> 00:32:01,265
I said,

634
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:05,866
we're going find a way to bring Fifi back
to the star section.

635
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,396
Super.

636
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,706
We are The Certifieds.

637
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:16,643
That's my place.

638
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,898
Thank you, girls.

639
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,626
Well,

640
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,295
I'm gonna get going.

641
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,589
I have a date with Anton.

642
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,022
I'm going home too.

643
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:57,125
Sometimes, change is just around
the corner,

644
00:32:57,787 --> 00:32:59,186
hiding itself.

645
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,049
Still not ready.

646
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,548
Still a virgin to change.

647
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,568
Wait, wait.

648
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,738
Your parents might walk in on us.

649
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,585
They're not home.

650
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:13,658
No, please.

651
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:16,269
What now, babe?

652
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:22,179
I'm not yet ready.

653
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,976
Ma?

654
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,022
Ma?

655
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:36,693
Ma?

656
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:47,621
Hello, Ma?

657
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,458
Where are you?
Are we eating dinner together?

658
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,126
Maybe not, dear.

659
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,338
We still have a meeting at school,
I'll be coming home late.

660
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:57,923
Eat your dinner, okay?

661
00:33:58,256 --> 00:34:01,134
Just heat up the stew I made earlier.

662
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,719
I cooked that for you.

663
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:04,846
Okay.

664
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:08,850
Don't take too long. It's already late.

665
00:34:09,184 --> 00:34:10,978
Take care. I love you, Ma.

666
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:12,813
Love you too, dear.

667
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,373
But sometimes,

668
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:23,031
we try to stop things as much
as we can from changing.

669
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:24,908
We even try to hide it.

670
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:25,742
Rafael!

671
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:28,954
- Go for defense.
- How's your first day?

672
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,612
It's okay, Pops.

673
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,030
Very good.

674
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:35,627
Come here, join us!

675
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:37,033
Let's watch basketball.

676
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:38,630
Come!

677
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:46,638
- Good, it's a tie now.
- Your team's weak. We can catch up.

678
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:50,308
I know you like basketball

679
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:53,061
but studies come first, okay?

680
00:34:53,145 --> 00:34:56,314
That's it! We're up by four points.

681
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:59,651
You should keep being a star student

682
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:02,279
so you can continue with basketball, okay?

683
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,018
You hear me?

684
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:04,894
Of course, Pops!

685
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:05,991
Trust me.

686
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:07,397
You have nothing to worry about.

687
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:10,358
I'll do whatever it takes to go back
to the star section.

688
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:12,748
Go back?

689
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:14,187
What do you mean?

690
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,072
No, Pops.

691
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:17,352
What I meant was,

692
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:19,963
I want to maintain being a star student.

693
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:20,505
Good.

694
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,399
I can do it, Pops.

695
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,508
You don't have to worry about me.

696
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:27,763
Bang! Who's leading now?!

697
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,444
Catch up!

698
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:34,132
We hold on to things we know
will be gone eventually.

699
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:38,803
no matter how big the change is,

700
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:42,582
we still keep a positive attitude
in facing change.

701
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:45,310
But for Diana,

702
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,020
in facing change,

703
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,631
all she has is a positive...

704
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:53,652
result.

705
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,348
Diana?

706
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:00,617
Dear?

707
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,813
I know it's

708
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:06,623
so hard

709
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,777
to adjust to a public school
coming from a private school.

710
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,391
But I know,

711
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:16,032
the Lord God has a reason.

712
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:51,668
I'm here in front of you
to fight for my right.

713
00:36:51,763 --> 00:36:53,782
My right to go back to the star section.

714
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:56,017
Fifi, we’ve decided.

715
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:57,340
Do you know what this is?

716
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:58,633
Homephobia!

717
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:00,135
Is it wrong?

718
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:01,398
Yes. It's wrong.

719
00:37:01,398 --> 00:37:03,304
I'm gay, I'm not good at spelling.

720
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:03,984
Diana!

721
00:37:03,984 --> 00:37:05,473
Get out the star section!

722
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:06,962
Don't tell me what to do.

723
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:08,435
Her Instagramn is pretty.

724
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:11,049
She's verified?

725
00:37:11,074 --> 00:37:12,188
Traitors!

726
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:13,910
You replaced me!

727
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:14,853
Is that why—

728
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,448
I feel like she’s hiding something.

729
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:23,324
Daddy.

730
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:25,034
Daddy?!

731
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,946
Like a sugar daddy?
