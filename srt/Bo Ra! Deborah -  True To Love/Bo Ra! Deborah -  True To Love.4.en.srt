1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,227
Yes.

5
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,688
I've been trying to reach you
since yesterday.

6
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,190
You just woke up?

7
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,358
Yes.

8
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:09,069
You know today's
an important event, right?

9
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:11,614
You have to do well.
Everybody worked hard on it.

10
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,116
Huh? On what?

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,495
On what? Hey!
Tonight is the Golden Night party.

12
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,371
Don't tell me you forgot.

13
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,126
No.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,880
I just woke up,
so I wasn't thinking clearly.

15
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,802
Okay. See you later.

16
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,317
'Cause you're garbage!
You're stinky, disgusting garbage!

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,777
The garbage is being loaded.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,029
That's right, I'm garbage too.

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,865
You are toxic waste
that can't even be recycled.

20
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,367
You really stink.

21
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,118
I'm garbage myself.

22
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,805
-Good morning.
-Hello, Sang-jin.

23
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,600
What is this?

24
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,936
What happened?

25
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,982
Sang-jin. Despite its great intention,

26
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,943
we reached an agreement
it has many inconveniences.

27
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:31,944
Right, Sang-jin.

28
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,531
We need to focus on work,
but the open plan is too distracting.

29
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:39,827
And it felt weird
facing each other without the partitions.

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,622
You know how awkward it is to make
eye contact while yawning?

31
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,507
It's not been long since
the partitions were removed.

32
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,302
How inconvenient could it have been?

33
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,221
How'd you find time to reach an agreement?

34
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:03,183
When you adapt to changes,
you go through a transition period.

35
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,520
U-ri?

36
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,481
You agree? Was it uncomfortable?

37
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,235
No, I really, really loved it.

38
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,781
Without the partitions,
it was easier to ask questions.

39
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,035
It was easier to catch up
with how everything was going.

40
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,579
Right, U-ri?

41
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:28,208
Hey, that's the benefit I was hoping for
when I got rid of all those with our U-ri

42
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,586
covered in sweat,
but you put it all back up.

43
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,256
And when the CEO suggests something,

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,759
you are supposed
to be supportive sometimes.

45
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,511
It's like, "You can say your piece,
I'll go my way."

46
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,764
Go where? You got so many places to go?

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,976
When I was your age,
I was unconditionally obedient,

48
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,354
did whatever I was told
without a question.

49
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,983
You are having it all too easy now.
This is like heaven, you know that?

50
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,903
Have the CEO's office. I'll sit here.

51
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,405
You should work comfortably
in the CEO's office.

52
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,954
I'll go work. Get some rest here.

53
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,456
If you're hungry,
eat or whatever you want.

54
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,001
I'm off. Just lie down.
I'll be standing up.

55
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,966
VP, I need to talk to you.

56
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,801
Why am I so out of breath?

57
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,303
Sit down. Why are you up?
Your legs must be tired.

58
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,604
He meant well, right?

59
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,731
Sit, sit.

60
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,233
He meant well.

61
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,448
"Our U-ri."

62
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,336
You were like a condescending geezer.

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,754
Those who hold a grudge

64
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,965
for something they made the person do.

65
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,591
Exactly like that.

66
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,678
"When I was your age,
I was unconditionally obedient."

67
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,805
That was so off-putting.

68
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,640
Seriously?

69
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,309
You wanted me to remind you
when you act like one.

70
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,103
That's why I'm telling you.

71
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:15,024
Okay, I'm a condescending geezer.
That's me. So what?

72
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,317
I thought you didn't know.

73
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,737
Seriously...

74
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,123
By the way,
we need to take it as a "no," right?

75
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,918
When you have a blind date,
no call for three days is a "no."

76
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,130
Look at how many days it has been.

77
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,638
"An offer you can't refuse"?

78
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,895
What is this? Spam mail?

79
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,399
That's how confident I feel
about the contract.

80
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,902
But that's not the point.

81
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,864
She told me to send a contract
as if she'd sign it right away.

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,825
She doesn't check emails.
She's unreachable.

83
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,411
Goodness.

84
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,371
You can't get a hold of her?

85
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,415
She ignores my texts,

86
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,793
her phone was off
when I called after email.

87
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,628
And she hasn't called me back.

88
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,839
She's straight up ghosting me.

89
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,176
She must have her own reasons.
Wait a little longer.

90
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,887
What is it?

91
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,642
Hey, you know something, right?

92
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:37,231
You followed her to give her phone back.
Did something happen that day?

93
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,858
Like what?

94
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,320
Bo-ra, Bo-ra...

95
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,947
Wipe your lips first.

96
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,455
You saw everything, right?

97
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,171
Any signs of backstabbing

98
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:03,549
or...

99
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,178
-Did you do anything wrong?
-I didn't.

100
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,347
We switched the phones and I came back.

101
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,939
For now, it is a "no."

102
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,567
But is it because
she's testing the waters?

103
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,112
Or is it because she already signed
with another company?

104
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,573
I need to know to plan my next step.

105
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,785
I'm getting a headache.

106
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:37,624
Seriously. Yeon Bo-ra.

107
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,751
It's a "no" either way.

108
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,962
Let's move on and try something else.

109
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,797
No.

110
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,926
It's been a while
I felt challenged like this.

111
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,598
I will get her signature no matter what.

112
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,522
Let's go.

113
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,691
Go where?

114
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,752
It's tonight.

115
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,313
Champagnes are provided by the sponsor.

116
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,649
-Make this straight.
-Okay.

117
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,567
Did you check the cue sheet?

118
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,737
Yes, all checked.
We're checking up on Deborah.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,460
You look so gorgeous today.

120
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,754
I thought there was an actress in here.

121
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,882
Right back at you.

122
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,134
Anna Wintour would be intimidated by you.

123
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,469
You look really stylish.

124
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,638
Give it to me.

125
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,684
I heard you got proposed to.

126
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,185
Congrats on your engagement.

127
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,353
Congratulations.

128
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,896
Congratulations.

129
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,486
Of course, marriage is a crazy thing.

130
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:35,117
But, it won't hurt
to do a crazy thing once in your life.

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,868
It calls for a celebration.

132
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,162
I appreciate it.

133
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:45,085
Oscar de Rang wants to do
a wedding dress shoot with you.

134
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:49,256
Among the dresses you try in the shoot
they'll sponsor the one you like.

135
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,133
You know, Oscar de Rang, right?

136
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,137
-I'm so jealous!
-Awesome.

137
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,680
Really?

138
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,599
I'll be really honored.

139
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,143
How did I land this?

140
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,897
I was talking with the PR manager,
who turned out to be your fan.

141
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,899
So I mentioned that you...

142
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,989
Was I not supposed to mention it
before the announcement?

143
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,910
No, I don't mind that at all.

144
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,079
Right?

145
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:24,499
Once this issue is out,
everybody will know anyway.

146
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,295
Now, before the party begins,
shall we have a toast?

147
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,630
Sounds good.

148
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,856
It's time to go.

149
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,359
-Let's go.
-Okay.

150
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,693
Good luck, Bo-ra.

151
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,779
-I'll look forward to it.
-Thanks.

152
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,113
You can do it.

153
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,014
Did you eat anything?

154
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,601
Did you take some medicine
after eating something?

155
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,937
Did you get any sleep?

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,400
Yu-jeong, can't you
just say, "nice dress"?

157
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,323
You look nice.

158
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,493
Good luck.

159
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,971
Our concept today is classy best friends.

160
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,432
Let's look mannerly
and politely offer champagne.

161
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,808
You know what I mean?

162
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,479
You do know why we are here
and who invited us?

163
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,230
I do.

164
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,324
What are you doing? Let's go.

165
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,422
-She smiled at me.
-Who?

166
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:26,181
Looks like you forgot the dress code
as you were busy looking stunning.

167
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,974
I see no champagne gold.

168
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,061
I do have champagne gold.

169
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,028
I missed that, since you are so gorgeous.

170
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,825
Behind you.

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,131
Long time no see, Su-hyeok.

172
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,600
People are staring at us to see
how the divorced couple say hi.

173
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:14,354
Smile and say hi.

174
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:21,361
It's been a while. Have you been well?

175
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,905
Thanks for inviting us.

176
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,115
Well...

177
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,368
You think it was me who invited you?

178
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,671
Anyway, you took the trouble

179
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,882
to come all the way here. Thank you.

180
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,175
No problem.

181
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,513
You look well. You look really pretty.

182
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,514
Don't.

183
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,850
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,828
Deborah, please standby.

185
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,831
-Okay.
-Okay.

186
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,464
Golden Night, a party for Gold Misses.

187
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,925
Tonight, we have a guest speaker
who'll give the Gold Misses tips

188
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,469
on how to win in a relationship.

189
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,222
The dating expert that is winning
in her own relationship!

190
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,017
She is Korea's first and top dating coach.

191
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,853
Please welcome to the stage Deborah.
Music, cue!

192
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,692
Deborah, please standby.

193
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,529
Okay.

194
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,824
EP 04
CRAZIER THAN JOKER

195
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,046
At that moment,
I felt a strong urge to tell those

196
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,884
who believed that Santa
will come on Christmas

197
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,011
if they are nice and don't cry...

198
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:39,684
that Santa Claus does not exist.

199
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,811
Deborah?

200
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:53,990
As long as I am worthy,
as long as my mojo is still present,

201
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,160
nothing will go wrong with my love life.

202
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:02,916
Even if that's not the case,
it's okay to break up or be alone.

203
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:09,964
And someday, I'll be recognized by someone
and love less and be loved more.

204
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,719
He'll eventually
get down on one knee with a ring

205
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,680
and we will have a happy ending.

206
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,308
I ought to tell
those who have this belief,

207
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,563
there is no such thing as Santa
nor happy endings.

208
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,819
JU-WAN

209
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:41,704
Your call has been forwarded to voicemail
and will be charged after the beep.

210
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,626
JU-WAN

211
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,842
After all, promises get broken,

212
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,512
love changes, and men leave.

213
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:02,225
A woman is a woman's worst enemy,
a woman you know at that.

214
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,645
I have to tell the truth.

215
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,773
I ought to.

216
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,580
A party for Gold Misses...

217
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,084
Welcome to Golden Night,
ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:30,271
By the way,
what's the point of being a Gold Miss?

219
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,775
It's no match for a Diamond Miss.

220
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,198
Why don't we be honest here?

221
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,535
Wearing a ring on a ring finger
on the left hand,

222
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,622
having a diamond ring there

223
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:53,586
means there's nothing to worry about
even if you go broke or lose your job.

224
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,549
It also means you're free from
guy problems or the pain of breakups.

225
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,220
Still, we haven't been able to do that

226
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:05,556
and are still called "Gold Miss."

227
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,726
We are losers.

228
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,312
We need to admit our failure first, right?

229
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,232
What?

230
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,943
Is this not what you were
expecting to hear?

231
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,990
Then what is it that
you wanted me to tell you?

232
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,204
It's okay to be alone?

233
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,373
You're so okay with being alone,

234
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,001
you wear high heels,
holding your head up high

235
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:35,044
curving guys with lots of attitude.

236
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:39,257
Then why do you highlight things
in my books, read my column,

237
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,552
cry and lose sleep over a guy all the time

238
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,221
and send me your stories seeking advice?

239
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,181
"Is this flirting?"

240
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,808
"Is it just me?"

241
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,852
"Does he even love me?"

242
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,906
You're okay being alone? As if.

243
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,247
You're scared and lonely 'cause
you think you might end up alone forever.

244
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,376
If not, why don't you extend your lease
no longer than a year?

245
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,839
You can't have a haircut as you like,
you reluctantly attend all the weddings,

246
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,841
you can't cut ties with friends.

247
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:27,346
Why do you keep holding off big decisions?

248
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,392
'Cause he will show up one day
and put a diamond ring on your finger?

249
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,935
Are you waiting for that?

250
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,730
Gold Miss, my foot.

251
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:41,319
Until we get married,
we just live an incomplete life.

252
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,489
An incomplete life
awaiting a complete life!

253
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,793
What else?

254
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,628
What else do you want to know?

255
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,005
How to hit on a guy?

256
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,008
When you think it's too late,
it's already too late.

257
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,011
You should have found a guy
when you were younger.

258
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:12,391
All the decent guys
are already taken by younger ones.

259
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,061
We got nothing.

260
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:20,066
So if an unattractive,
ugly, old guy likes you,

261
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,902
just date him.

262
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,403
Go date him.

263
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,532
-What's she doing?
-Or...

264
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,617
Or...

265
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,412
get plastic surgery, facial fillers,
or shave down some bone.

266
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,081
Do something.

267
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,208
Now!

268
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:43,256
Shall we talk about men?

269
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,466
Men.

270
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,595
All men are...

271
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,146
bastards!

272
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,652
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

273
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,404
Let me try again.

274
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,951
Deborah says!

275
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,747
Men are bastards!

276
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,833
What is she saying?

277
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,126
Get her off stage!

278
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,211
Why do you call men bastards? Why?

279
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:29,093
At first, they follow you around
like a little puppy,

280
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:33,764
but when another girl is nice to them,
they smooch that girl, those bastards.

281
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,352
-Did I cross the line?
-Turn off the microphone.

282
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,437
-Turn it off.
-There.

283
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,772
Guess what they call us
if they feel unheard!

284
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,816
They call us bitches. Bitches!

285
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,986
Don't just stand there. Go do something.

286
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,654
Come on, do something.

287
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,616
Even a pro dog trainer
can't fix those bastards.

288
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,492
Put on some music! Louder!

289
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,954
Bastards.

290
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,082
The most terrible bastard was...

291
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,334
Music, cue!

292
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:05,171
Everybody is leaving. Do something!

293
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,763
Louder!

294
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,028
I thought my life was a tragedy,

295
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,448
but it was a comedy.

296
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:29,005
I wish someone would come
and take me to anywhere but here.

297
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,218
I wish I could become smaller than an ant

298
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,762
and be carried outside.

299
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,938
Put me down, please.

300
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,161
Don't follow me.

301
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,719
It's my second time seeing that back.

302
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,099
Yes, Yu-jeong.

303
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:15,356
It's near the back door.

304
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,526
Yes.

305
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,121
-Hello.
-We're terribly sorry.

306
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,291
-We'll take the...
-Yes, sir...

307
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,001
Oh, that was...

308
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:39,129
The incident was something
we failed to expect.

309
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,883
Once again,
we apologize for the inconvenience.

310
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,218
We're sorry.

311
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,264
I'm going nuts.

312
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,691
You're here, ma'am.

313
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,193
You look like Meryl Streep today.

314
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,071
Yes, I think I'm going to be the devil.

315
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:06,865
Gather around, everyone.

316
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,534
Come along.

317
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,456
So what's the status?

318
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,958
We're jammed with complaints,

319
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,962
not only from the guests
but also the sponsors and advertisers.

320
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,007
Fortunately, no one said
they'll pull back their ads.

321
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,259
Just not yet.

322
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:29,430
These days, even a small incident
instantly leads to a boycott.

323
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,515
What kind of advertiser would put an ad

324
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,435
in a magazine
with column of a controversial figure?

325
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,562
I just checked.

326
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,815
The next issue has already been printed.

327
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,528
Deborah.

328
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,197
How can she screw me over?

329
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,327
I let her jump on the bandwagon,

330
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,413
but she repays me by ruining everything?

331
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,837
Why did she do that?
Let me hear the reason.

332
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,259
Why are you all looking at me?

333
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:09,345
What do you mean? You're her best friend.

334
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:11,013
Is it because she was drunk?

335
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,349
Or has she gone insane
preparing for the wedding?

336
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:17,353
Are you sure she was drunk?
She wasn't high?

337
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,355
How would I know?

338
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,026
There are various kinds
of friendship between women.

339
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,237
You know, it could be
just shallow and superficial.

340
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,367
We aren't close enough
to pour our hearts out to each other.

341
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,548
What the fuck...

342
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,514
Good morning.

343
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,642
Don't put anyone through.
Call the security manager stat.

344
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,106
Sir.

345
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,235
Amp up the number of security guards,
if needed,

346
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,946
to prevent outsiders from entering. Okay?

347
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,865
And remember this photo.

348
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,492
This person.

349
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,870
-Call right away if you see her, okay?
-Yes, sir.

350
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,506
Even I feel hurt.

351
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,134
-This isn't the end.
-Really?

352
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,927
Who do you think it is?

353
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,264
-Vice president?
-It is. It's Su-hyeok.

354
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:40,894
So manly.

355
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:45,566
A knight in shining armor.

356
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,946
-So cool.
-And handsome.

357
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,905
Amazing!

358
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,324
A flasher's big picture
to show her panties?

359
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:55,325
Not impressive.

360
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,747
She's a parasite obsessed with a man.

361
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,710
The video is going viral,
the Internet is flooded with articles,

362
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,756
and the intensity
and speed of the hate comments...

363
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:12,092
Even a traitor
wouldn't be criticized this much.

364
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,261
And it's so cruel.

365
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,973
Even if she did something wrong,
how can they bash one person this hard?

366
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,726
Like what they say
in the comments isn't crass.

367
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:24,605
She makes a living
by using her celebrity status.

368
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,190
It's the price for fame.

369
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,233
That's not fair.

370
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,443
She works hard too.

371
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,820
Why are her tax
and exchange rates different?

372
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,405
Rightfully so.

373
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,450
'Cause she touched an extremely
sensitive issue in Korea.

374
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,915
Hey, why did you jump on the stage
all of a sudden?

375
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,917
'Cause a person collapsed.

376
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,752
She didn't collapse, she just fell.

377
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,754
And when you see a woman fall,

378
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,173
it's good manners to pretend
you didn't notice.

379
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,716
It's super embarrassing.

380
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,385
So what now?

381
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,013
-What?
-Deborah's book.

382
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,556
What are you going to do?

383
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,977
As for that...

384
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,733
we need to keep an eye on things for now.

385
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,657
How can she come back from this?
It's safe to say she's finished now.

386
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,371
If Deborah calls you, don't answer it.

387
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,249
It'll only make things awkward
for each other, right?

388
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,584
Jeez.

389
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,755
It's not like I said something wrong.

390
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,467
Did I do something wrong?

391
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,788
INFLUENCER DEBORAH

392
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:09,459
UNDER FIRE FOR FOUL LANGUAGE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE IN PUBLIC

393
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,796
HURLING OFFENSIVE REMARKS AT THE GUESTS

394
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,300
THAT WERE AS INFAMOUS AS POLITICAL BRAWLS

395
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:17,384
DREADFUL DEBORAH SAYS

396
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,261
SAYING MEN ARE BASTARDS AND MOOCHERS

397
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,637
PROVOKING OUTRAGE AMONG MEN

398
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:28,145
Saying there's no Santa
came at a bigger price than I thought.

399
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,687
ALL SPINSTERS THERE
GOT A DAGGER IN THEM.

400
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,981
OTHERS' LOVE STORIES
WAS HER MONEY-SPINNER.

401
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,408
Who is it?

402
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,035
It's me.

403
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:30,582
Hey.

404
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,293
How is she doing?

405
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,712
I don't know.
She won't come out of the room.

406
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,348
You still hungover?

407
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,560
Get up already.

408
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,647
Hey. Come on.

409
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,529
Did you see the articles?

410
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,615
In the morning.

411
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:10,956
They say I hate men
and I hate women as well.

412
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:16,336
I was thinking what kind of person I am

413
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,965
if I hate both men and women.

414
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,926
What could it be? A public enemy.

415
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,929
It's not the time for this.
It's really serious.

416
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:29,766
Signing a petition?

417
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,811
Look how far it got in just half a day.

418
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,606
This is blowing out of proportion.
At this rate...

419
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:42,946
When you say one word wrong
you get buried in no time these days.

420
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,658
And you didn't say just one word.

421
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,828
I should have dragged you
off the stage yesterday.

422
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,248
I should have knocked you
in the head and made you pass out.

423
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,710
I shouldn't have let you say all that.

424
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,796
Yes, you should have.

425
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,131
Hey.

426
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,801
New articles keep coming up in real time.

427
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,095
MOM'S CHICKEN F&amp;B'S FULL STATEMENT

428
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,180
What is it?

429
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,224
What?

430
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,685
In this situation?

431
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,439
-What?
-How can he do this in this situation?

432
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,734
He didn't even call you, right?

433
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,949
Our company and Deborah
are connected by a model contract.

434
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,744
We confirm that our company
has nothing to do with her.

435
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,205
As a way to take responsibility
for the incident,

436
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:35,749
we inform that we decided

437
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,960
to terminate the contract
with Deborah effective today.

438
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,880
The company probably decided
to dodge the bullet.

439
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,341
But who caused all this mess?

440
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,845
Whatever, now you have to do something.

441
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,889
First off, post an apology right away.

442
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,934
If you don't do it now,
you'll be dragged to do it later.

443
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,435
What should I write?

444
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,481
"My boyfriend cheated on me
and even dumped me."

445
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,817
"I was drunk, out of it,
and made a scene."

446
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,277
Should I say that and ask them
to go easy on me?

447
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,239
Or to curse at him with me?

448
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,202
You can say that. That's a fact. Why not?

449
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,412
At least people will feel sympathetic.

450
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:15,789
Let's focus on you.

451
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,083
We have to prevent this
from getting worse.

452
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,530
Hello, this is Deborah.

453
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,866
I am deeply sorry

454
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,829
for my inappropriate and insensitive words
under the influence at the event.

455
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,748
I would like
to sincerely apologize to those

456
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:00,750
who were offended by my remarks.

457
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:06,506
I recently came to part with my boyfriend

458
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,884
whom I had dated for quite a long time.

459
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,304
As a dating coach,

460
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,640
I've indirectly experienced
countless relationships and breakups.

461
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,643
But when I went through it myself,

462
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,230
I had a dreadful time
going through the breakup

463
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,608
and was hardly able
to control my emotions.

464
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:28,195
Though I was physically
and emotionally drained,

465
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,447
I could not cancel the event.

466
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,949
As a result of pushing through it,

467
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,286
I ended up getting on the stage drunk,

468
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,789
and saying awful things
that were inexcusable.

469
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,668
Unlike some people suspected,

470
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:46,213
drugs nor alcohol abuse were involved.

471
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,467
From the incident,
I completely realized how emotional,

472
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,803
vulnerable, and irresponsible
I am as a person.

473
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,140
I take full responsibility for my actions,

474
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:01,186
so I will stop all the activities
planned for the future

475
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,939
to take the time to reflect on who I am

476
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:08,944
and how I can become more mature
in the future.

477
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:13,073
Thank you for taking
the time to read this.

478
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,784
Sincerely, Deborah.

479
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:23,083
I actually had a slight hope
as I was making the confession

480
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,837
that maybe this can
act as mitigating factors.

481
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,010
However, reality hit...

482
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,431
and there's nothing like Santa
in this world.

483
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,059
CLASS ACTION FOR DEFAMATION...

484
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,023
CONFESSION ON HER BREAKUP!
HAND-WRITTEN APOLOGY

485
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:50,318
REASON FOR BREAKUP?
ALCOHOL? DRUG? NETIZENS' COLD RESPONSE!

486
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:54,364
A woman in her thirties,
self-pity party after being dumped.

487
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:58,159
She made such a fuss all the time.

488
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,455
Long story short.
She got dumped, drunk, humiliated herself.

489
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,916
She has so many excuses.

490
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,002
A woman who loses control of her emotions

491
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,628
sickens me as a woman myself.

492
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:10,714
She's crazy like Joker.

493
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:15,385
Deborah's ex-boyfriend
is the real winner in the relationship.

494
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,387
She's a real "K-ex-girlfriend."

495
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,932
Are those who unlike the comments
Deborah's friends?

496
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:34,821
She's a dating coach,
but she got dumped. How pathetic.

497
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,490
I saw that coming
as she was being a know-it-all.

498
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,867
A total smarty pants.

499
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,161
If she thinks about
what she's said so far,

500
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,538
she'd cringe really hard.

501
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,582
Deborah the Liar, isn't this a lie too?

502
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,085
Will she turn on the waterworks now?

503
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:06,353
ACCOUNT PRIVACY
ACCOUNT SWITCHED TO PRIVATE ACCOUNT

504
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,818
I went from a crazy and horrible bitch,

505
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,198
to a pathetic and a little weird bitch.

506
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,370
I also got nicknames like Pet Peeve,
Deborah the Liar, and Korean Joker.

507
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,206
A complete failure.

508
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,541
A complete downfall, indeed.

509
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:37,967
God never gives us
more than we can handle.

510
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,053
Isn't that amazing?

511
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:44,224
I must be a really remarkable bitch.

512
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:52,690
You overestimated me!

513
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,611
You see, I can't handle this much.

514
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,366
Hey.

515
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,493
You're drunk.

516
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,745
I'll bring more.

517
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:07,080
I'll bring more.

518
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,625
We're out of beers.

519
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,335
I'm good.

520
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:16,673
Then we can drink wine.

521
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,425
Wine.

522
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,225
PLEASE ALWAYS SPEAK TO ME NICELY

523
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,353
Nicely? How?

524
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:31,729
It's all ruined!

525
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:33,731
You want to hear nice words?

526
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,234
You did wrong,
but you don't want to be blamed?

527
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,570
You think someone will comfort you?

528
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,363
Get it together.

529
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:44,742
In this cold, harsh world,
no one is on your side!

530
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,953
People waited on your downfall.

531
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,831
People are gloating
'cause you became miserable.

532
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,499
Let's put her to bed.

533
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,086
Let's go to bed. Come on.

534
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,593
-Put it down.
-It's not the time for nice words.

535
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:02,677
All right.

536
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,013
-Seriously...
-Give it.

537
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,685
Yu-jeong, I'm really...

538
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,230
I'm sorry, Yu-jeong.

539
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,399
I'm sorry.

540
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,651
Thank you, I mean it.

541
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,449
Bo-mi. My Bo-mi.

542
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,494
Bo-mi, I'm really sorry.

543
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,037
I love you.

544
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:40,089
Next item.

545
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,636
"If you're not sincere, don't come near."

546
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,931
"If you're meant to pass me by,
please just pass me by."

547
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,682
"To deal with more heartbreaks...

548
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,020
tteokbokki is too spicy."

549
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,858
This is written in Korean, right?

550
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:00,902
I don't get it. What is it?

551
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,696
It's an excerpt from
a famous writer on social media.

552
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,284
The concept is a book you read at
3:00 a.m. while having a beer by yourself.

553
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,871
These kind of sentimental books
are in high demand these days.

554
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:16,167
On top of sentimental illustrations,
if we add some calligraphy,

555
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:21,172
it can be a sentimental illustrated essay,
which can draw readers' attention.

556
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,262
How does it sound?

557
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,222
Well...

558
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,598
Not bad.

559
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,811
An expensive book cover,

560
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:38,273
pretty illustrations and calligraphy,
comforting sentiments.

561
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:42,652
Shoving everything that could work
into one book to make money,

562
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,029
that superficial goal is clearly noticed.

563
00:47:45,113 --> 00:47:47,490
It'd be a relief
if it sells well at least.

564
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:52,161
You could have just said
it's a bad idea, Su-hyeok.

565
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:54,122
No, it's not bad.

566
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,459
The thing is,
planning what's hot now is pointless.

567
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:00,878
We should take the initiative.

568
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,131
We can't be an imitator,
albeit third-rate.

569
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:07,677
Let's just say
this proposal was a bad one.

570
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,515
No, what I meant was...

571
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,768
Okay, then. Let's move on.

572
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:19,647
So not this one. What's next?

573
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,693
That's it?

574
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,947
That's really it?

575
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,533
Right.

576
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:32,702
It had to be this.

577
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,335
This was the best option.

578
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,046
You said no, why are you so hung up on it?

579
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,301
It's better to be hung up on work
than on a girl like someone.

580
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,886
Where's this coming from?

581
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,266
You mean me?

582
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:58,853
Do you still stare
at Yu-ri's profile photo?

583
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:01,856
Didn't I always tell you?

584
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,275
I know.
Women are half of the world population.

585
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,902
I have no objection to that.

586
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,070
Really?

587
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,404
Then how about tonight?

588
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:12,241
Let's go on a double date
with the models we met at the party.

589
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,079
You said you got over her.

590
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,998
It's not because I'm not over her.

591
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,584
How can I meet someone else
right after a breakup?

592
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,795
It's not good manners to my ex.

593
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,965
You got it wrong.

594
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,096
It's good manners to forget
someone who left you.

595
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,235
I'm so sick and tired of it.

596
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,489
You said you got over her.
Are you a stalker or what?

597
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,449
You got something wrong too.

598
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,703
It's true that women
are half of the world.

599
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,832
But there's only one Yu-ri.

600
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:03,543
Hey, why is Yu-ri only one?

601
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,545
There's Sung Yu-ri, Lee Yu-ri,

602
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:09,340
-Yu-ri in Girls' Generation.
-Stop joking.

603
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:13,594
Sang-jin.

604
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:18,099
If I call her now, she'd be asleep, right?

605
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:22,770
Yes, with another man, maybe.

606
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,440
Seriously...

607
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,316
She's not that kind of woman.

608
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,152
Hey, what's that kind?

609
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,653
You guys broke up.

610
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,864
She said that she'd meet someone else.

611
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,282
You didn't stop her. And?

612
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,117
I'm trying to win her back now.

613
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,869
It's too late.

614
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,704
How can you win her back now?

615
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:47,003
She's probably waiting to hear from me.

616
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,631
The song was played again today.

617
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:53,050
The song she chose
when she told me she likes me.

618
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,805
So what you mean is

619
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,560
she picked the song in the radio show

620
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:05,146
to send a message that
she's not over you yet?

621
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,565
Like some kind of spy code?

622
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:13,154
You're so seriously deluded
that I don't know what to say.

623
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,495
I'm telling you this
because it seems like you'll call her.

624
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,538
I'm sure she has a new boyfriend.

625
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,499
If you'll call her, just know that.

626
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,085
What are you talking about?

627
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,712
Who told you that?

628
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,172
And how do you know?

629
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,382
What is it?

630
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,425
Huh?

631
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,351
Look.

632
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,649
Count. One, two, three, four
five, six, seven.

633
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,567
Look at these fingers in the back.

634
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,445
It's a man's hand around her shoulder.

635
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,447
Don't you know where this is?

636
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:58,115
It's in Gangneung, where we went

637
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,576
to catch squid.
It's the hottest café there.

638
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,495
And two cups of coffee.

639
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,580
On top of that. Here.

640
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,041
"Heart fluttering."

641
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,379
Okay, forget about everything.

642
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:13,464
Look at her face.

643
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:17,009
Her makeup and facial expressions,
all point to her having a boyfriend.

644
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,636
Hold on.

645
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,642
How can these be a man's fingers?

646
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,312
Look carefully. It's a man's fingers.

647
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,690
No. Forget it.

648
00:52:30,773 --> 00:52:32,275
You're talking nonsense.

649
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,027
Okay. All right then.

650
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,405
Yu-ri has seven fingers. Happy?

651
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,949
Hello?

652
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,493
What is it?

653
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,955
A messenger voice call. I answered.

654
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,582
Who's Sang-jin?

655
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,458
Sang-jin?

656
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,253
Hello?

657
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,213
Sang-jin?

658
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,716
Yu-ri.

659
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:02,972
I meant to call a different Yu-ri.

660
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,602
So you called the wrong number.

661
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,062
Yeah.

662
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,940
You know, Yu-ri.

663
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:15,401
I know so many people with the same name.

664
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,573
You haven't changed. I'm doing well.

665
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,868
Okay. Glad to hear that.

666
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,621
How's the publishing business going?

667
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,081
It's going well. Sure.

668
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:32,209
So sorry to bother you at night.

669
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,254
Good night, and be happy.

670
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,221
I told you.

671
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,058
It's good manners to forget
someone who left you.

672
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,813
Look at her.
She's got great manners, dude.

673
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:27,848
Sir, I'm sorry,
but please go to Yongsan Forest Town.

674
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,406
Thank you.

675
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:07,763
When do we meet again?

676
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:10,891
I'll come again tomorrow.

677
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,309
Really? Okay.

678
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,105
You got something in your hair.

679
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,314
Thanks.

680
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:20,276
-Call me when you get home.
-Okay.

681
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:22,111
Head inside.

682
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,697
-Okay.
-Hang on.

683
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,452
-Get home safe.
-You too.

684
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,412
-I'm really going.
-Okay.

685
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,706
-Bye.
-Bye.

686
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,667
Bye.

687
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,385
So how's your sister doing?

688
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,803
Does she eat well?

689
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,722
Yes, she does.

690
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,641
So Mom, don't worry about her.

691
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,185
And visit later on, okay?

692
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,853
She's so carefree.

693
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,606
How can she eat anything
in this situation?

694
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:01,984
After she got drunk, talked rubbish,
and made such a big scene.

695
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:05,696
I'm so embarrassed
that I can't hold my head up.

696
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,324
Why's she not getting married
all of a sudden?

697
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,242
There's no one like Ju-wan for her.

698
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,495
Why is she so fickle-minded...

699
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,914
I wouldn't know.

700
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,625
She's driving me crazy.

701
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:18,751
Hang up.

702
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,338
Where are you going?

703
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,965
Just to get some fresh air.

704
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,509
You want me to go with you?

705
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,345
Why?

706
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,598
Are you worried about me?

707
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,979
I'm such a bad sister, making you worried.

708
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,113
I'm okay now. Don't you worry.

709
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,073
-Okay.
-See you later.

710
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,826
Don't be too late.

711
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,328
Watch out for cars.

712
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,704
Come home early.

713
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,248
Okay.

714
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,046
That makes me more worried.

715
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,598
The sky didn't fall in,
and everything on earth was there.

716
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,560
The world was the same as yesterday.

717
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,979
The only thing that has changed is me.

718
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:02,224
Every day, you smile at me

719
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:09,064
Every night, you call me

720
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:16,113
Trying to be someone else
Who you want

721
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,408
Though it's hard...

722
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,037
ONE DAY, 2 YEARS AGO

723
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:31,128
You're listening.
I picked this song for you.

724
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:32,838
You like it, right?

725
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,549
But to me, ballad songs
all sound the same.

726
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,177
The lyrics are nice.

727
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,179
It's something I want to tell you.

728
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,766
What do you want to say?

729
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,064
That I will be waiting for you here

730
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:54,818
till you come to me,
unless you tell me not to...

731
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:55,903
Don't.

732
01:00:58,697 --> 01:00:59,990
What?

733
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:01,658
You don't need to.

734
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:18,926
Stop waiting for me.

735
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,428
From now on, I will do that.

736
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:39,696
What's wrong?

737
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,366
Yu-ri, what's wrong? Get up.

738
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,159
What's wrong?

739
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,328
You scared me.

740
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,834
Were you scared? I'm sorry.

741
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,296
-Did I scare you a lot?
-Yeah.

742
01:01:58,215 --> 01:02:00,259
All right, I'm sorry.

743
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,527
I was super cool back then.

744
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,173
What the...

745
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,176
Why is she crying like that?

746
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:43,195
She thinks there's no one outside?

747
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,160
TRUE TO LOVE

748
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:36,164
You know what always happens
to the key witness, right?

749
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:38,125
-Why are you crying?
-Smile.

750
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,086
They die. Are you trying to
warn me or something?

751
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:44,256
-By the way, why do you hate me so much?
-I don't hate you.

752
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,092
I thought we'd be different from
other married couples,

753
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:51,013
but after getting married,
I realized that we're not any different.

754
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,557
Did my boobs get smaller?

755
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,226
"Dating coach Deborah
failed in her relationship?"

756
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:58,103
So you can't write books about love?

757
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:00,230
What would they want to hear about love?

758
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,441
Just be satisfied with seeing my panties.

759
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:04,484
Why can't you just let it go?

760
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,070
You can't get over disappointment
or your ex.

761
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:08,614
How can I make you stop?

762
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,490
I hate you. I hate you like crazy.

763
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:13,035
Let's not see each other again.

764
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:17,122
Even if you see me crying, falling,
or even hit by a car, just pass me by.

765
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,874
Sure. I will.
