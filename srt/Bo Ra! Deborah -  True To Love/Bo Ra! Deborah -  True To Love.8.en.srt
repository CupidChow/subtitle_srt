1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,796
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,171
Hello.

5
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,215
We're having a housewarming today,
you should come.

6
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,675
Yes, please do.

7
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,387
Why are you wearing this here?

8
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,805
There you go.

9
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,267
What do you want to eat?
Continue your meeting.

10
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,607
Please do come to my housewarming party.

11
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,028
You have a lot of company over.
Let's have a meeting next time.

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,112
Bye.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,205
I'm screwed.

14
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,542
Lee Yu-jeong, what is with you?

15
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:26,962
What?

16
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,175
Oh, this?

17
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,803
How did you notice?

18
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:38,307
It's just that Jin-woo remembered
that I wanted to have this.

19
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,310
He got me this as a present.

20
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,978
Jin-woo bought you this?

21
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,397
Yes. You know how much this tiny thing is?

22
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,316
Like he had money to burn.

23
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,276
It's way too expensive.

24
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,489
How does it look?

25
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,699
Does it look nice?

26
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,453
I don't know.

27
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,998
Look at this, Bo-mi.
This is really hot among young people.

28
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,795
He already bought it,
so I might as well use it.

29
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,382
A housewarming was just an excuse.
You came to show off.

30
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:16,136
Hey. Don't be upset. Jealous much?

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,057
I give up.

32
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,562
Housewarming, with what?
There's nothing to eat in this house.

33
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,522
There's no need to worry.

34
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,816
Have you forgotten
what Korea is famous for?

35
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,609
Take out my cell phone.

36
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:33,362
-All right, be careful.
-What do you want to eat?

37
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,864
-Delivery?
-Yes.

38
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,740
I'll order it. Here.

39
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,494
Yeah, let's eat something.
I'm hungry, what do you want, Bo-mi?

40
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,371
I want tteokbokki.

41
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,416
-Tteokbokki.
-Tteokbokki.

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,377
That should be Jin-woo.

43
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,505
I told him to bring Jin-ho
to help move your bed.

44
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,132
I'd be grateful.

45
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,842
I should get changed then.

46
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,678
-Who is Jin-ho?
-Our new part-timer.

47
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,140
Is he good-looking?

48
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,766
Look at you. No doubt.

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,685
He's a total cutie.

50
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:10,858
Hi, Jin-woo.

51
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,818
It's been a while.

52
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,029
-I haven't seen you at the store.
-I'll visit.

53
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,989
Babe, you're here.

54
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,741
-Hello.
-Hi.

55
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:24,830
Hi, Jin-ho. Say hi. This is Bo-mi,
Bo-ra's little sister.

56
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,624
Oh, hello...

57
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,925
Do you know each other?

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,177
-We...
-Nope!

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,387
I've never met him before.

60
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,598
-Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,807
We don't.

62
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,225
Not at all.

63
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,518
Come on in.

64
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,610
-Isn't it heavy?
-It's okay.

65
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,820
How about we put the mirror here?

66
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,863
One, two, three.

67
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,406
Be careful.

68
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,744
-We need curtains in the living room.
-Let's go.

69
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,412
-Can you do it?
-Of course.

70
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,831
He said he can.

71
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,708
I need to hang some curtains too.

72
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,877
Sure thing.

73
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,305
Hey.

74
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,100
Why are you making it obvious you know me?

75
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,020
You want me not to? Okay.

76
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,273
But why can't I?

77
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,318
If you know me, how are you going to
explain how we met?

78
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,988
We met at a club...

79
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,828
I hope you didn't talk about me
to other people.

80
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,996
What?

81
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,790
That's...

82
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,583
Seriously, don't do that.

83
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,043
Okay.

84
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,802
You should skip one.

85
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,720
-Here?
-Yes.

86
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,430
There.

87
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,266
Coming. The food is here. Bo-mi!

88
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,697
You really made it.

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,408
I thought I'd at least see you this way.

90
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,202
-I hope I'm welcome.
-Of course.

91
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,454
This is for you.

92
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,955
You didn't have to.

93
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,498
Seriously?

94
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,377
-You're here, Su-hyeok.
-Hello.

95
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,005
-Are you leaving, Yu-jeong?
-What?

96
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,883
Oh, this?

97
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,429
It's just that my husband
remembered that I've wanted this

98
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,556
and gave it to me as a present.

99
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,183
That's wonderful.

100
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,101
-I'm Lee Su-hyeok.
-I'm Yang Jin-woo.

101
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,520
Enough, babe.

102
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,189
-What.
-Hello?

103
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,274
I need to show it off.

104
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,650
What?

105
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,195
The bell didn't ring.

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,863
-Where are you?
-Please sit.

107
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,156
Okay.

108
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,369
Please put it inside.

109
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,081
What's wrong?

110
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,084
I had the food delivered to
my previous address.

111
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,168
What?

112
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,753
Bo-ra.

113
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:24,510
I'm sorry for the trouble.

114
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,596
I know. Who knew I'd be
the only one who brought a car?

115
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,605
About that staff dinner...

116
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,316
That day...

117
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,527
What about that day?

118
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,031
About me talking nonsense
and urinating on the street?

119
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:46,990
What about it?

120
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,617
You drink to get drunk.

121
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,369
What's the big deal?

122
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,373
When you get drunk and hang loose.
That's being down-to-earth.

123
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:59,795
People who gossip about it
are the ones who lack social skills.

124
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:05,551
In fact, I was so drunk that day
that I don't remember anything.

125
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:11,890
I hope I didn't make any mistake.

126
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,025
I wanted to act like I didn't know.

127
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,155
But you had to reveal everything
on your own.

128
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,656
Now I don't need to.

129
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,996
Again, I wish I was a little patient.

130
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,039
Tell me about it.

131
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,589
So heavy.

132
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,090
Give it to me.

133
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,812
Do you like shrimp?

134
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,649
-Eat.
-Okay, thanks.

135
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,779
Honey.

136
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,823
Let's put this down. Good girl.

137
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,329
No.

138
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,290
This is what my darling gave me.

139
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,002
Okay, eat.

140
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,045
Eat.

141
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,047
What are you doing?

142
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,510
If I'm overjoyed, he'd do it again.
You said it yourself.

143
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:34,348
Not too much. It would backfire
and he'd never do it again.

144
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,768
-Seriously...
-So should I lose it?

145
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,852
Lose it.

146
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,193
Jin-ho.

147
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,238
-That hoodie...
-Yes?

148
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,162
Isn't it too small?

149
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:02,376
No, it's an oversized fit.

150
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,923
I know because I had one. That's small.

151
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,759
Is it?

152
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,220
That's odd.

153
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,430
By the way,

154
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,434
how did it go with Ms. Destiny?
Did you take my advice?

155
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,103
The thing is...

156
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:23,230
Like you said,

157
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,773
I didn't do anything.

158
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,483
Nothing happened, right?

159
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,488
It's okay.
She's not the only girl in the world.

160
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,740
You can meet another Ms. Destiny.

161
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,285
Yeah, good for you.

162
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:40,163
Since it's over, I'll be honest.
I didn't wish well from the get-go.

163
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,081
What?

164
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,374
Destiny, my foot.

165
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,335
She's obviously a hardcore clubber.

166
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,962
-But...
-Yeah, she's young.

167
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,381
She must be a player.

168
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,217
-Bo-ra...
-She gives a guy her number at a club,

169
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,803
then fights with another guy
in front of a motel.

170
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,471
That's absurd.

171
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,224
To us, it's obvious that
she's a bad influence.

172
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,642
-It's obvious.
-Yes.

173
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,269
You can't put it that way.

174
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,478
What?

175
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,232
What I meant was,
like you said, I did nothing

176
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,359
and saw her again thanks to destiny.

177
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,445
She's not a hardcore clubber at all.

178
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:15,449
She's really pretty, sexy, and frugal...
She's that type of person.

179
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,412
If you see her one day,
I bet you'll really like her.

180
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,248
Yeah, I doubt I'd ever meet her later.

181
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,961
Even if that's true,

182
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,963
I don't care.

183
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,424
Because I like her.

184
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,719
When you like someone,
you like everything about that person.

185
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,181
Okay.

186
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,184
Look at his eyes.

187
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,186
He's blinded.

188
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,147
He's blinded by something.

189
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,651
You used to have those eyes.

190
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,569
Did I?

191
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,571
Whatever.

192
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,531
Do you have a girlfriend?

193
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:58,992
No.

194
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,911
-How about my sister...
-Hey.

195
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,581
Stop it.

196
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,377
Between my sister and I,
who do you think is prettier?

197
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,347
-You're Bo-mi, right?
-Yes.

198
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,641
So do I. I'd pick Bo-mi.

199
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,601
Seriously...

200
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,271
Men are the same.

201
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,232
Here.

202
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,192
Sure.

203
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,779
Look how you make a club already.

204
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:40,409
Right. You two are
the voice phishing victims' club.

205
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,452
Right!

206
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,704
That's how you two know each other.

207
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,000
You met at the police station
as voice phishing scam victims.

208
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,295
Why would you bring that up?

209
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,051
Everybody here knows already.

210
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,344
This guy didn't know.

211
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,221
"This guy"? Don't be rude.

212
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,598
Bo-mi, it is okay.

213
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,227
You fall for scams when you're young,
it's all part of the experience.

214
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,813
Jin-ho, tell us your story.

215
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,316
A senior at your school dragged you
into a pyramid scheme.

216
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,485
Why would you bring that up?

217
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,154
-Pyramid scheme?
-Yes.

218
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:20,407
He got locked up
and was forced to get a loan.

219
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,492
You said it was on the news, right?

220
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,827
Tell us the story.

221
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,622
You told the whole thing.
There's nothing more...

222
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,876
Anyway, you go through
this and that when young.

223
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,918
Right?

224
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,214
Have a drink, Bo-ra.

225
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,941
-Cheers?
-Sounds good.

226
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,028
Cheers!

227
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:00,655
Hang on.

228
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,908
-We should take a picture.
-Yes.

229
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:04,910
With the bag.

230
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,078
-Can you all get in the shot?
-Yes.

231
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,121
Is it possible?

232
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,873
Everybody is in the shot, right?

233
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,501
All right, one, two, three...

234
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,132
-Thanks for the dinner.
-Thanks for having us.

235
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,553
-Taxi is almost here. One more minute.
-Okay.

236
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,430
-So quick.
-I know.

237
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,238
You see...

238
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,533
About voice phishing...

239
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,867
What about it?

240
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,287
Even really smart people fall for it.

241
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,039
No, it's not that.

242
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,544
I just wanted to ask if
that was why I couldn't reach you.

243
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,296
-I had no idea.
-Whatever.

244
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,883
How could you fall for a pyramid scheme?

245
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,635
That...

246
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,388
was not a pyramid scheme.

247
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,641
It was some marketing program.

248
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,686
Anyways,

249
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,524
you said earlier you have a boyfriend.

250
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,861
Is that true?

251
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,698
I don't have one.

252
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,659
Oh, okay. I see.

253
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,954
In that case, I was just wondering...

254
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,959
if you're okay with keeping in touch.

255
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,335
If you're uncomfortable...

256
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,421
As if you ever asked for my permission.

257
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,465
Right.

258
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,386
Jin-ho, taxi is here. Let's go.

259
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,637
I'll go.

260
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,979
-Bye.
-Bye.

261
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,231
-Call me.
-Okay.

262
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,859
-Bye, Su-hyeok.
-Bye.

263
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,322
The front door is open.

264
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,165
Thanks for coming today. And for the gift.

265
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,459
I had fun too.

266
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,962
I'm not sure if you'll like my gift.

267
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,881
I'll make good use, whatever it is.

268
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,425
It's a reading lamp.

269
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,890
-I'm going to get going.
-Bye.

270
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,487
New memories are created in a new space.

271
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,785
An empty space is filled with new things.

272
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,511
Welcome.

273
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,428
Hello.

274
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,182
-Would you like to try it on?
-These are birthstones.

275
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,685
If you wear a birthstone
of your birth month,

276
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,354
it will bring you good luck.
It makes a great gift.

277
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,856
What is your birth month?

278
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,276
Diamond is April.

279
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,862
Mine is February.

280
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,826
February birthstone is amethyst.

281
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,036
Each birthstone has a different meaning.

282
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,498
Amethyst are known
to bring a romantic relationship

283
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,041
and represents love.

284
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,793
Love...

285
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,214
So pretty.

286
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,225
May luck be ever in your favor.

287
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,115
I get used to new things.

288
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,757
An empty space...

289
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,801
An absolutely empty space...

290
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,015
gets filled by someone else.

291
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,267
Have you been waiting long?

292
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,686
No, I got here early.

293
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,148
We could have met near your place.
Next time I'll go there.

294
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,149
Okay.

295
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,112
EP 08
REWRITE THE ENDING OF THIS STORY

296
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,369
Age was the reason, after all?

297
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,583
So you finished analyzing
the cause of failure.

298
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,126
What's your next plan?

299
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,214
Business is ruthless indeed.
You don't even let me eat this.

300
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,091
As for the next plan,

301
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,011
I'll figure it out.

302
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,223
So there was no infallible trick?

303
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:24,312
Where was that confidence
and your big talk coming from?

304
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,525
Even if I just scribble,
I have amazing penmanship.

305
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:33,363
If I recite, it becomes a poem.
When I hum, it becomes jazz.

306
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,407
I do not operate on plans,
but by intuition.

307
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,993
You believe in your intuition?

308
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,372
In other words,
you're saying you're a genius.

309
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,082
Am I?

310
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,166
Are you not?

311
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,044
Be patient.

312
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,171
I'm organizing my thoughts.

313
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,092
Now that I had some sweets,
it won't take long.

314
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,969
I'll eat this.

315
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,974
You said you can make yourself
look attractive to men, didn't you?

316
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,561
You said you can, if you have a motive.
Was that a lie?

317
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,062
No.

318
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,773
Seduction is an easy task.

319
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,317
This is about getting an ex back.

320
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,862
It's not a simple matter.

321
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,072
Seduction is easy?

322
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,242
Why? You're still not convinced?

323
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,495
Because nothing has been proven.
It's hard to be convinced.

324
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,291
If you want proof,
you want me to seduce you?

325
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,711
Would that be even possible?

326
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,837
Well...

327
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,882
It goes like this.

328
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,425
At first,

329
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,221
I get a little closer to you...

330
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,021
Look into your eyes...

331
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,526
And smile.

332
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,576
When you drink coffee, I do too.

333
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,167
Whatever.

334
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,045
When you rest your chin on your hand,

335
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,088
I do that too.

336
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,804
Coffee tastes good here.
It has good vibes too.

337
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,393
Right, I'm not a regular though.

338
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,355
You smell nice. What cologne do you use?

339
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:32,899
This one?

340
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,068
I got it as a gift. What was it called?

341
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,905
I make lots of positive comments,
give compliments,

342
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,826
and subtly show feminine beauty.

343
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,917
I close my eyes slowly

344
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,877
and open them quickly.

345
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:56,839
I close my eyes slowly

346
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,384
and open them quickly.

347
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,223
Then, suddenly, I whisper.

348
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,267
What's that?

349
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:13,147
We get really close.

350
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,281
So that was your seduction skills?

351
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:23,783
Yes.

352
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,952
-Seduction?
-Yes.

353
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,208
Seduction? For real?

354
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,795
Come on.

355
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,464
This is supposed to work.

356
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,133
Unbelievable.

357
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,886
You need to be open-minded
for this to work.

358
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,764
If you're that close-minded,
how can this work?

359
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:49,434
A magic show works
when the audience just watches.

360
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,979
If you doubt every trick,
even David Copperfield can't make it work.

361
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:56,190
No, it's not that kind of a problem.

362
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,319
With that,
no matter how open-minded a guy is,

363
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,697
I don't think you can
get the results you desire.

364
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,074
Was it that bad?

365
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,909
You're not just saying that?

366
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,120
I dare myself to evaluate.

367
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,622
It was obnoxiously cheesy,

368
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,833
let alone attractive.

369
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,294
The acting was over the top and insincere.

370
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:22,008
It even made me wonder
how I need to react to this.

371
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,720
It was a pretty unpleasant performance.

372
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,558
Still, I had some good laughs.

373
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,686
Maybe not now,
but you'll think about me before bed.

374
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,146
Is that a curse?

375
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,397
A curse?

376
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,691
Anyways, you failed to prove it.

377
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,945
Ms. Yeon.

378
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,408
Now is the time to trust your intuition.

379
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,662
If you can't make up for it
with the next plan,

380
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:55,666
we might have to reconsider
our publishing plan for your book.

381
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,836
I got an idea about the next plan.

382
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,299
Plan 1.

383
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,426
I'll break up with him.

384
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,138
Did you forget you'd broken up
with him already?

385
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,683
I really don't like the ending.

386
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,103
I'll rewrite the ending of this story.

387
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,525
Listen.

388
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,528
Humans have a tendency to forget.

389
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,239
According to
the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve,

390
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,575
more than 50% of new information
is forgotten within the first hour,

391
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,621
70% within 24 hours,
and 80% within a month.

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,165
Then what do we have left?

393
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,918
Human brains have
a limited memory capacity.

394
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,130
Our brain remembers
only the first and last parts.

395
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,257
That's why, in a romantic relationship,

396
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,801
the first and last impressions
are crucial.

397
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,098
While the first impression defines
the general image of a person,

398
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:56,644
the last impression forms
a lasting image you'll remember.

399
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,354
Got it?

400
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,815
Yes, I understand.

401
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,528
The last impression he has of me is...

402
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:11,200
a woman wearing pajamas
and slippers with disheveled hair.

403
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,535
Are you drunk?

404
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,495
I was drunk, my face was puffy,

405
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,875
I wailed and was clingy.

406
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,335
I remember that.

407
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,922
With that horrible last impression,

408
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:28,301
I won't last in his memories,
let alone see him again.

409
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,180
That's why I'm going to
break up with him again.

410
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:37,435
You'll break up again
and change the last impression?

411
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,729
How does that sound?

412
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,565
Would it be enough to make up for it?

413
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,197
You make a valid point.
It's interesting as well.

414
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,407
Right?

415
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,123
Anyways, the problem is

416
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:03,127
I have to see him again
in order to break up again.

417
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,503
Why is that a problem?

418
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,548
It has to be a coincidence.

419
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,219
If I tell him that I want to see him,

420
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,138
he'd bring his lawyer.

421
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,974
If I go to his house,
he might call the police.

422
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,186
That's possible.

423
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:25,566
Then how can you see him
coincidentally on purpose?

424
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,904
That's why we came here.

425
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,955
It's been a while.

426
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,081
How are you?

427
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,333
It's been so long.

428
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,503
I was thinking that
it was about time you two come back...

429
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,342
-Sit anywhere you want, please.
-Okay.

430
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,898
This is his soul food.

431
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,026
He comes here at least once a week.

432
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,780
He may forget me,
but he can't forget these noodles.

433
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,657
He will definitely come back.

434
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,703
This is the perfect place
to coincidentally run into him on purpose.

435
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,666
What was your last impression like?

436
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:28,587
Why are you being so nosy?

437
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,716
We're in the same boat,
let's help each other out.

438
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,175
Who knows?

439
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,887
Maybe your last impression was worse,
and I'd feel better after hearing it.

440
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,100
I don't think it'd make you feel better.

441
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,562
Because I lost quite gracefully.

442
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,565
When she wanted to break up,
I accepted it without resistance.

443
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,027
She was taking a taxi,

444
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,654
I ran and gave her some cold medicine,

445
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,574
because she was sniffling due to a cold.

446
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,870
You left the worst last impression
on her as well.

447
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,248
You made it harder for her
to hate you when splitting up.

448
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,292
Why did you have to be so sweet?

449
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,883
I want to lose gracefully.

450
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:17,595
Even if the other player played dirty,

451
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,139
I want to graciously protect my dignity

452
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,352
and accept the results.

453
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:31,359
Maybe not now,

454
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,696
but you'll think about me before bed.

455
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,992
Not in the slightest.

456
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,828
I'm so falling asleep.

457
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,249
You smell nice. What cologne do you use?

458
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,544
My cologne smells nice?

459
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:55,591
Cologne is supposed to smell nice.

460
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,093
Then...

461
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,512
Why's she stroking her hair?

462
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,555
...suddenly, I whisper.

463
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,185
What's that about?

464
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,063
She thinks all men would fall for that?

465
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,608
That's nuts.

466
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,736
Jeez.

467
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,197
I'm just going to sleep.

468
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,223
-Good morning, Sang-jin.
-Very good morning, U-ri.

469
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,683
-Hello.
-Good morning.

470
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,685
-Good morning.
-Hello.

471
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,311
Good morning, Su-hyeok.

472
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,938
Right, good morning.

473
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,401
You just came to work, why the long face?

474
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,616
-You've been in this mood these days.
-Have I?

475
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,953
Is it because I'm not getting sleep?

476
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,080
Did you have nightmares
and sleep paralysis?

477
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,627
Something similar.

478
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,588
I'm even losing my voice.

479
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,634
How's it coming along?

480
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,888
Well... It's a little weird,

481
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,016
but fun.

482
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,143
Weird in a fun way.

483
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:34,190
That is a good thing.

484
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,902
THE ART OF CRAFTING THE LAST IMPRESSION.

485
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,946
When you guys split up,
how was your last impression?

486
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,656
The last impression?

487
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,325
I heard, when you break up,

488
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,703
your last impression stays
with the other person.

489
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,121
-Does it?
-Yes.

490
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,376
I think we were in court.

491
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:57,880
Court?

492
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,605
It was nice seeing you
at your housewarming.

493
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,902
By the way, do you like pork cutlet?

494
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,655
Do you want to have pork cutlet with me?

495
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,122
All right, I'll find a good restaurant.

496
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:35,834
Welcome.

497
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,631
What are you doing?

498
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,008
Enjoying the view of my husband.

499
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:50,099
Isn't he so attractive?

500
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:58,691
He's not typically handsome,
but he looks young and has great skin.

501
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,527
Look at him.

502
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,572
With his broad shoulders,
everything looks good on him.

503
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,242
His backside is well-rounded,
which is super cute.

504
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:09,827
Though he's reserved,

505
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,205
he sometimes says random stuff,
which is hilarious.

506
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,082
Also, he's a great cook.

507
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,167
He knows tons of good restaurants.

508
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,837
He's the guy every girl wants.

509
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:24,717
You really...

510
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,428
What?

511
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,471
You truly love him.

512
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,811
This is true love.

513
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,445
What's with him?

514
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,823
He's been wiping the same spot
over and over again.

515
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,784
Was it obvious?

516
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,873
Bo-ra, the thing is,

517
00:31:56,582 --> 00:32:00,210
I'm going to tell her on our first date.

518
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:04,048
I don't know how. I can't help but think
you'd know better than anyone else.

519
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,884
As if. You talked back to me before.

520
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,178
By the way,

521
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,181
tell her what on a first date?

522
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,016
My feelings.

523
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,435
That I love her.

524
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,653
How about an event in public?

525
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,618
Like singing in front of many people,
and shouting out loudly,

526
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,953
"I love you, please accept my heart."

527
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,706
Imagine that. Isn't it romantic?

528
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,835
Don't women hate that?

529
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,837
I read it on the Internet.

530
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,339
That's nonsense.

531
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,591
Every girl dreams of it.

532
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,550
Right?

533
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:54,181
Sure. That's why we see
lots of those scenes on TV dramas.

534
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,058
Because it's every woman's dream.

535
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,480
If you say so.

536
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,233
Okay!

537
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,320
Our naive Jin-ho.

538
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,615
This should end things
with the clubber, right?

539
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:12,866
No doubt.

540
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,412
Who wouldn't run away
from a surprise event in public?

541
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,833
-Welcome.
-Hello.

542
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,751
-Hello.
-Hello.

543
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,752
Su-hyeok.

544
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:26,964
Hello.

545
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,674
-Hello.
-Have a seat.

546
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,050
Thanks.

547
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,304
You came early.

548
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,601
Here you go.

549
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:47,943
I made a rough proposal
that just suggests the tone and direction.

550
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,447
Considering your intuitive style,

551
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,159
an overly-detailed plan
would rather hamper your creativity.

552
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,038
PR and marketing plans
are to be added on after publication.

553
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,916
This is just a rough version.

554
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,087
Let's work out the details
as you write the draft.

555
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,924
President Han was right.

556
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,010
What?

557
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm glad I decided to work with you.

558
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,766
You're really good.

559
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,478
Thanks.

560
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,022
What's he so good at?

561
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,358
What do you think it is? Work.

562
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:33,197
He's always been good. I do know that.

563
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,412
The important thing is

564
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,167
what kind of ending you write.

565
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,044
That's already decided.

566
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,047
Like the ending of La La Land.

567
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,340
La La Land?

568
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,383
I watched it again recently.

569
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,136
That's exactly the last impression
I want to make.

570
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,932
She is in a black dress

571
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,267
and is dressed up perfectly.

572
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,354
She runs into her ex.

573
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,775
She is about to stand to leave.

574
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,904
She turns back and smiles.

575
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,615
"What do you think?"

576
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,159
"I'm having the time of my life
without you."

577
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,829
"Can you see my happiness?"

578
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,250
A glance that says all that.

579
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,420
I don't think

580
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,007
that was what the glance meant,

581
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,885
if we are talking about the same film.

582
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,387
That's how I saw it.

583
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,808
The man watches her leave till the end

584
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,310
with sad eyes.

585
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,272
That is

586
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,108
the ending I want.

587
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,610
That's the last impression
I want to leave.

588
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,535
La La Land at a naengmyeon restaurant?

589
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,757
Picking a black dress to copy
the black dress from La La Land.

590
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,803
I'm horrible at that stuff.

591
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,932
You're more than capable of shopping.
Why did you bring me here?

592
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:28,478
Because today I need
the perspective of a critic

593
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,231
completely free from
compliments or lip service.

594
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,233
By what standard?

595
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,819
In a word,

596
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,280
from a man's perspective,

597
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,240
a dress with the "wow" factor.

598
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,034
"Wow factor"?

599
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,994
You know.

600
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,247
A dress that makes you see her

601
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,875
moving in slow motion all of a sudden?

602
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:09,603
I don't know.

603
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,983
It's pretty.

604
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,035
Not really...

605
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,662
Is it too much?

606
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,916
Looks pretty to me.

607
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,626
So picky.

608
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,463
This is it, right?

609
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,096
Not even with this?

610
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,983
It's all the same.

611
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,359
What's the difference?

612
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,502
When you break up,

613
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,213
your last impression stays
with the other person.

614
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,184
Han Sang-jin, Seo Su-jin.

615
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,686
-Please come in.
-Okay.

616
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,023
Get up.

617
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,538
COURT

618
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,124
Wait...

619
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,253
You want to go eat something?

620
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,842
You'll eat alone for the rest of your life
and you'll live a lonely life.

621
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,262
No one will ever cry or smile for you.

622
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,806
You will end up dying of loneliness.

623
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,808
You deserve that.

624
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:33,288
Where are you?

625
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,499
I don't know, it'll take a while. Why?

626
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,959
What do you mean "why?" To have lunch.

627
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:41,129
There's no one. Seems like they're
working and eating out.

628
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,174
Hasn't this thought hit you?

629
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,968
Maybe everyone is avoiding you.

630
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,807
Are you guys really
shunning me on purpose?

631
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,517
Just kidding.

632
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,393
No need to be ticked off.

633
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,794
I'll call you later.

634
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,759
Not this one either?

635
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,597
I guess not.

636
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,893
Did you just...

637
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:42,190
Did you just move
in slow motion on purpose?

638
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,487
I'll take this one.

639
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,073
I don't want to eat alone.

640
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,909
Sang-jin.

641
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,036
You didn't go for lunch yet?

642
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,413
I...

643
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,498
I have no appetite.

644
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,918
You want me to get you a sandwich?

645
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:02,961
No.

646
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,921
Enjoy your lunch, U-ri.

647
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,675
I'll step outside
so you can enjoy your lunch.

648
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:09,759
No...

649
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,345
I'm fine.

650
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm really fine.

651
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,563
Sang-jin.

652
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,648
Do you want to share with me?

653
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,859
I didn't touch it yet.

654
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,569
No.

655
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,279
I really have no appetite.

656
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,202
I just feel snacky.

657
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:37,996
I see.

658
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,081
That's a home-cooked meal.

659
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,709
If you mix those up with gochujang,

660
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,085
it's to die for.

661
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,129
Come on, we can share.

662
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,340
I got many side dishes,
it's too much anyway.

663
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,884
There's rice and gochujang
in the break room.

664
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,344
Shall we mix it with that?

665
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,221
No.

666
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,264
I really have no appetite.

667
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,918
Here.

668
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,639
Seems like you really like hearts, U-ri.

669
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,266
Pardon?

670
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,686
You make a heart quite often.

671
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,730
In fact, my credit card signature
is a heart.

672
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:50,610
That's not it...

673
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:58,910
It's not that I like hearts.

674
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:05,625
It's just that, Sang-jin, I like...

675
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,419
That was too salty.

676
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,545
It was.

677
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,005
Are you having lunch?

678
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,715
Yes, I'm done.

679
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,134
I just ate.

680
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,144
Ms. Yeon?

681
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,815
Yu-ri.

682
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,443
What a coincidence seeing you here!

683
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,069
I know.

684
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,488
Have you been well?

685
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:37,699
Well...

686
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,619
As you know, it has been eventful,

687
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,246
so not very well.

688
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,875
We were really worried about you.
And we reached out a lot.

689
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,960
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,255
I was going to reach out to you.

691
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,090
I'll visit sometime.

692
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,968
Would you tell the crew I said hi?

693
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,845
I will. Please do visit us.

694
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,096
See you later.

695
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,473
Take care.

696
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,602
Mom.

697
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,687
Are you here already?

698
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,314
No, I'll go there.

699
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,523
Okay.

700
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,380
Now all you need to do is a stakeout?

701
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,382
For your La La Land moment.

702
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,884
That's right, so we will

703
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,346
meet in front of the noodle place
around 2:00 p.m. Sunday.

704
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,389
Wait.

705
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,849
"We"? You said "we"?

706
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,976
Yes, of course.

707
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,980
We need to be on a stakeout together.

708
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,274
That's why we've been having a meeting.

709
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,485
Aside from that,

710
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:58,822
I think I have no reason to be there
on my day off.

711
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:03,076
Stakeouts are done sitting in a car.

712
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:07,455
I have a license, but I don't drive.
So obviously, I don't have a car.

713
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,916
If there's no progress in my plan,

714
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,919
there will be a setback
in our publication process.

715
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,880
Sunday 2:00 p.m. I'll call you.

716
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,382
Okay? You'll come, right?

717
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,092
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

718
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,553
I didn't answer.

719
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,888
Even if I don't show up, don't blame me.

720
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,850
Why can't you come?

721
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,059
On Sunday...

722
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,106
I have important plans I'd put off.

723
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:36,109
How important? Is it really important?

724
00:45:36,818 --> 00:45:39,070
You'll eventually come, right?

725
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,324
Oh, well, you can at least leave your car.

726
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:48,329
How else can I be on a stakeout?
Standing outside alone?

727
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,417
It's 2:00 p.m. I'll call you.

728
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,960
I'll give you a wake-up call.

729
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:55,420
Okay?

730
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:59,048
See you at 2:00 p.m. Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

731
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,383
Hurry up.

732
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,652
-Jin-ho.
-Hey.

733
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,406
-No traffic on the way?
-No.

734
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,532
I'm hungry.

735
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,285
-I heard the place is great. Let's go.
-Where?

736
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:28,703
Across the street.

737
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,455
-You found the place?
-Let's go.

738
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,544
You're like a gift

739
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:39,589
Prepared just for me

740
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,425
Every little thing

741
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:45,970
Getting bigger and bigger

742
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:51,976
My everyday life that's always ordinary

743
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,814
Become special at this moment

744
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:58,274
Are you having fun?

745
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,860
We have a very special stage.

746
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,820
Today, there is a man

747
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,990
who wants to express his feelings
to Ms. Destiny here.

748
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,450
Give it up for him!

749
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:12,789
I always only think about you

750
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,582
You're the only pretty one

751
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,251
I'm in love

752
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,336
I fell in love at first sight

753
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,422
At the club we first met

754
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:25,760
Spotlight on you, I became blind

755
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:30,098
I couldn't hear what you were saying

756
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,559
You're the only one for me

757
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:36,312
You're my angel, we were destined

758
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,856
I became certain again

759
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:43,528
My angel, my destiny, finally I

760
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,654
Made up my mind

761
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:49,409
To take another step towards you

762
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,910
Please accept this!

763
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:52,745
Please accept this!

764
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,331
So embarrassing.

765
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:56,916
Oh, no.

766
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,501
I feel bad for her.

767
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,712
Public execution.

768
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:03,590
I would run away.

769
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,592
Poor guy.

770
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:07,468
Oh, no.

771
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,480
Cheer up.

772
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:20,690
Cheer up.

773
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:24,611
Cheer up.

774
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,362
It was wonderful.

775
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,323
Don't do it again.

776
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,490
Dismiss.

777
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,492
It's okay.

778
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:33,828
I feel bad for him.

779
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:35,330
It's okay.

780
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:41,628
Jin-ho.

781
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,297
Look back.

782
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,479
Sing.

783
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:03,650
You're like a gift prepared just for me

784
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:04,984
Follow me quietly.

785
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,112
Every little thing

786
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,282
Getting bigger and bigger

787
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:16,788
My everyday life that's always ordinary

788
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:22,210
Become special at this moment

789
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,183
Have you lost your mind?

790
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,935
What the heck was that?

791
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,603
Are you screwing me over?

792
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,565
Are you mad?

793
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,236
I was told you'd like that stuff.

794
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,405
Who said I'd like that? Who said so?

795
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:51,948
Them.

796
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,118
Yu-jeong and my sister?

797
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:04,502
Did you talk about me again?
What is wrong with you?

798
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,547
Do you always blab about
girls you meet to the world?

799
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,673
No.

800
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,717
I just...

801
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,845
I just didn't know what to do.

802
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,515
I like you so much. I really like you.

803
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:21,686
There is nothing I can do other than
being nice to you and liking you.

804
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,604
That's why...

805
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,571
Then you can do just that.

806
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,576
You can just be nice to me and like me.

807
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:43,624
You mean we are together now?

808
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,336
You said if we meet again,
we'd be together. Didn't you?

809
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,379
I did.

810
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,925
Let's go have pork cutlet. I'm hungry.

811
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,594
Okay.

812
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,850
By the way,

813
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,020
can I hold your hand?

814
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:08,274
I just took a chance. Never mind.

815
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,906
Happy now? Let's go.

816
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,283
Okay.

817
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,515
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

818
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,892
I'll call you.
I'll give you a wake-up call.

819
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,604
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

820
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,940
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.
at the naengmyeon place.

821
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,947
Please do me a favor.
Okay? You'll come, right?

822
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,948
It's 2:00 p.m.

823
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,826
See you at 2:00 p.m. Sunday at 2:00 p.m.

824
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,496
It's 2:00 p.m.

825
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,500
Jeez, okay. I got it.

826
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,792
What was that?

827
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,548
So cold-blooded. Is he really not coming?

828
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,428
Is he ever coming today?

829
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,556
-Probably.
-"Probably"?

830
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,850
You say that now?

831
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,143
Almost certainly.

832
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:12,064
Based on the extensive data
accumulated for years and my gut feeling,

833
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:14,483
it's highly likely that he'll come today.

834
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,403
Every Sunday, he goes to church,

835
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,865
hits the gym and sauna,
and has naengmyeon here,

836
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,659
to wrap up the week on a high note.

837
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,955
So, you mean, if he doesn't show up today,

838
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:30,791
we'd have to do this every Sunday?

839
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,544
Why do you ask the obvious?

840
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,673
Do you think I have no life?

841
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,175
Come on.

842
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:41,469
I need to rest on the weekends.

843
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:44,764
Is he here?

844
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,057
I think he's here.

845
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:50,978
Be careful.

846
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,449
How do I look?

847
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:07,370
-Do I look okay now?
-Yes, you do.

848
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:08,663
-Really?
-Yes.

849
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,124
I'll be back.

850
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,668
Good luck.

851
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,772
Thank you.

852
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,194
Hi.

853
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,575
Can we talk?

854
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:48,953
Okay.

855
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,545
You look well.

856
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:03,384
How's everything? How's work?

857
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:05,594
Same old.

858
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:14,437
I actually wanted to
talk with you in person

859
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,355
when I'm sober.

860
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:21,193
I thought you might come around this time,
and here you are.

861
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:29,243
I agree with what you said.

862
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,829
I'm glad we parted ways.

863
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,920
If we make each other unhappy,
it's right to go our separate ways.

864
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,301
I'm sorry.

865
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,136
Right.

866
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,764
You should be sorry to me.

867
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,392
You could've been honest with me
and broken up,

868
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:54,935
I would have understood.

869
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,190
It's not the end of the world
even if we break up.

870
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,360
I'm doing well, as you can see.

871
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:05,863
Yeah.

872
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,158
You look great.

873
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:15,831
Of course, I would have needed
some time to process it.

874
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:21,295
You should have waited for me till then,

875
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,090
considering the time we spent together.

876
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,094
But,

877
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,807
since we broke up because of someone else,

878
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,435
I had to go through hard times.

879
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:41,732
Right. I'm sorry about that too.

880
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:45,444
No, I'm not asking you to say sorry.

881
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,488
I just wanted to explain.

882
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,907
The way I acted after our breakup...

883
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,788
I was hoping you would understand me.

884
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,499
Yes, I totally understand.

885
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,585
That's a relief.

886
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,007
At least, we got to
talk in person like this.

887
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:12,346
Though we can't say hi
when we run into each other,

888
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,307
it won't ruin our whole day
at least, right?

889
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:16,934
Yes.

890
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,773
That's all. I'm going to get going.

891
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:24,984
Okay.

892
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,529
No, finish up.

893
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:31,949
I know you like it.

894
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,993
We came practically every day in summer.

895
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,245
We ate this shivering in midwinter.

896
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,331
There was one time we came here all week.
Remember that?

897
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:46,630
If you leave any, you'll regret it.
You'll think of it before bed.

898
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,011
That'd be too late.

899
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,016
Too late. Okay.

900
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,604
Also, you can feel at ease coming here.

901
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,148
I'm not coming back here.

902
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,193
Take care.

903
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,028
Okay.

904
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,901
What?

905
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,195
Why are you still here?

906
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,530
Did it go well?

907
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:57,034
Yes.

908
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,997
Let me give you a ride.

909
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,398
Seriously, why did you stay?

910
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,733
Were you worried that I'd make a scene?

911
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:35,906
In a movie, the female protagonist
usually gets escorted by a better man.

912
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,451
Are you being serious?

913
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,958
Thanks anyway.

914
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:50,838
Walking out, my legs felt weak.

915
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,552
But I did not cry.

916
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,725
It's really something.

917
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,811
You want my compliment?

918
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,064
Well done.

919
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:10,858
Though you lost,

920
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,485
you fought the good fight.

921
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,740
How do you feel after the breakup?

922
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:25,539
She wanted to hum a tune,

923
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,584
chatter away with anyone,

924
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:33,630
and wanted to vanish into
the defenseless, bustling streets.

925
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,593
You really are like Shakespeare now.

926
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,721
Where are we going?

927
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,196
Karaoke?

928
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,074
You said you wanted to hum a tune.

929
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,587
Here.

930
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:15,756
Sing your lungs out.

931
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:22,221
I might cry if I sing on a day like this.

932
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,139
What's wrong with crying?

933
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,308
It's okay to cry after breaking up.

934
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,476
Don't you think?

935
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,020
Okay. Here.

936
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:51,375
He said he was leaving me

937
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:54,670
So I told him to leave

938
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,173
Thought it was a line you hear

939
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,385
At least once when you love someone

940
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:04,972
Looking at myself in the mirror

941
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,892
I convinced myself he's coming back

942
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:12,479
Have been counting so many days

943
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:15,649
Can't even remember how many

944
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,029
But I still can't see you

945
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,658
Can't find where my love is

946
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,870
Groping around

947
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,248
Looking for your photo

948
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:35,752
My eyes go blind

949
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,256
Burst in tears

950
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,133
Leaving severe bruise

951
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:46,096
On my heart

952
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:48,807
Told me to forg...

953
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,852
-Why?
-No.

954
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,187
That's not the song.

955
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:55,105
Listen carefully.

956
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:58,442
I HAVE NO PROBLEM

957
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:01,862
Seriously?

958
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:06,742
I'm on top of this world

959
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,912
I want to

960
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:13,081
Go my way

961
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:17,127
With my people who love me
Love me!

962
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,923
It was tough and lonely

963
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,383
But it's just a practice

964
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,012
I'm not falling down

965
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:30,015
I have no problem!

966
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,354
I think my voice is hoarse.

967
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,815
How are you feeling?

968
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,067
Do you feel better?

969
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:27,823
Thanks.

970
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,492
Thanks to you,

971
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,244
I was able to do something.

972
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,872
I think I lost gracefully.

973
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,585
I feel the same.

974
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,588
Ever since I met you,

975
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,173
it's been so chaotic

976
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,094
that tough moments passed by
before I knew it.

977
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,640
I think it was kind of fun, thanks to you.

978
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,768
Do you have to add "I think"?

979
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:00,230
Are you doing that on purpose?

980
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:01,607
Are you being an edgelord?

981
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:22,461
Let me put it away.

982
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,304
I'm out of coins.

983
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:41,521
Shall we go?

984
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:44,608
Okay.

985
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,199
Your bag.

986
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,090
On the day I broke up with him,

987
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:54,052
I kissed another man.

988
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,211
TRUE TO LOVE

989
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:31,423
-I heard about some mistake yesterday.
-She told you about it?

990
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,508
-It's me.
-We both made a mistake yesterday.

991
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,594
That's very misleading. Let's be careful.

992
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,805
What are you doing? Stop! Oh, my!

993
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:41,892
-...to avoid such a mistake again.
-Something urgent came up.

994
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:42,976
-Do you like me?
-No.

995
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,311
Me neither.

996
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,522
-So sorry, Young-hoon came to Korea.
-Young-hoon!

997
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:48,940
He insisted I come see him.

998
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:51,276
Thanks, sorry, love you.

999
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,528
-T-S-L.
-On a day like this...

1000
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:55,864
I don't wanna drink by myself
on a day like today.

1001
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,240
I don't feel like dating.

1002
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:59,576
-Is today special?
-Can't spend today like this.

1003
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,286
-Are we going out?
-Let's go.

1004
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,706
Su-hyeok? Making a man like him fall
for me is child's play.

1005
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,707
Need some fresh air.

1006
01:08:05,791 --> 01:08:07,250
A mistake again? I should let you off?

1007
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:10,378
You don't care about others.
How can you be so selfish?

1008
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:11,797
Let me apologize.
