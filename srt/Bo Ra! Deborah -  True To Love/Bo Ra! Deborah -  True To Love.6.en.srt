1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,199
It's hot. Be careful.

5
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,207
Are you still cold?

6
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,128
I turned on the seat warmer.

7
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,006
Hang on, it'll get warm soon.

8
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,726
Why are you crying again?

9
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,022
You said you would love yourself more.

10
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,608
As a writer, you should
practice what you preach.

11
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,986
Why are you so sad?
It's not the end of the world.

12
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,491
You're not the only one
who's been in love.

13
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:57,910
You're being so dramatic.

14
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,080
Are you hungry for attention or what?

15
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,165
Why are you so angry?

16
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,708
Who cares if I cry or not?

17
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:08,003
I love being the center of attention,
so what?

18
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:10,381
'Cause it's frustrating.

19
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,134
"I loved him the most, I'm so sad."
Do you think anyone would care?

20
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,470
While we're like this, they're...

21
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:20,266
Stop it.

22
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,731
Put on your seat belt.

23
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,150
I did.

24
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,175
Go straight to bed.
Go see a doctor in the morning.

25
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,636
Do that.

26
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,021
PLEASE ALWAYS SPEAK TO ME NICELY

27
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,872
This is like the common cold.

28
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:53,168
Everything will be all right
as if nothing happened.

29
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,713
No, stop lying.

30
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,715
You said it'll be all right.

31
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,094
You said it'll be all right.
It's not all right at all.

32
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,764
I feel like I'm going to die!
You know that?

33
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:18,652
Bo-ra.

34
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,946
Are you still washing up?

35
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,365
Bo-ra?

36
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,036
Bo-ra.

37
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,332
Bo-ra!

38
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,752
Bo-ra!

39
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,146
Bo-ra!

40
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,066
Wake up, Bo-ra!

41
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,400
Bo-ra!

42
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,485
What?

43
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,987
Seriously...

44
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,865
I thought you were dead.

45
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,700
Hey...

46
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,578
What the hell!

47
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,081
What is all this, seriously?

48
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,625
I threw up wine.

49
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,004
Go outside. Let me take a shower.

50
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,927
-What's all this?
-What's the matter?

51
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,054
What are you thinking?

52
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,098
You thought I'd slit my wrist?

53
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,976
No, I'm okay.

54
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,103
What's wrong?

55
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,772
What are you thinking? That's crazy.

56
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,732
Why would I die?

57
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,192
It's okay.

58
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,820
I just...

59
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,699
I was just overwhelmed
by my feelings of heartbreak.

60
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,867
I thought...

61
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,494
I'm not going to die.

62
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,330
Don't cry. Stop crying, it's okay now.

63
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,790
Stop crying.

64
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,874
Bo-ra.

65
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,670
You still got me, Mom and Dad.

66
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,257
So please, Bo-ra...

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,394
Don't cry.

68
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,022
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:25,821
To be honest,
there was a brief moment when I thought

70
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:29,700
I want to fall asleep
and never wake up for good.

71
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,617
But...

72
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,786
Wake up, Bo-ra!

73
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,622
-I woke up...
-Bo-ra!

74
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,958
...and this thought ran across my mind.

75
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,919
Though it won't resonate with people

76
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:44,673
like Stendhal's tombstone that says,
"He lived, wrote, and loved"...

77
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,508
Please stop.

78
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,427
How can I make you stop?

79
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,513
I can't leave this world
with a tombstone that says,

80
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:54,725
"She was dumped, drunk, and clingy."

81
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,936
And then,

82
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,732
I felt the ground.

83
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,610
Bo-ra.

84
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,947
It had felt like a bottomless pit,
but then I felt the ground.

85
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,034
Only then did I come to feel at ease.

86
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,788
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,458
It was impossible to sink deeper.

88
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,667
What's this...

89
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,629
I hit rock bottom
and it can't get any worse.

90
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,967
Now I can only get back up on the ground.

91
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,280
In this breeze...

92
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,158
I will survive.

93
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,288
EP 06
I WILL SURVIVE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL BREEZE

94
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,543
You've been drinking often lately?

95
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:09,299
Not that often...

96
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,640
-Yes.
-I see.

97
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,934
It's alcoholic gastritis.

98
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,603
Fortunately, it's not severe.

99
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,522
That's such a relief.

100
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,319
'Cause it's not the common cold.
It means it's curable.

101
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,238
Right.

102
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,368
Make sure to take the medicine.
You know what I'm going to say, right?

103
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,537
-Yes.
-Okay.

104
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,416
Avoid spicy food,
coffee, flour for a while.

105
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,419
-No alcohol, of course.
-It wasn't the common cold.

106
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,881
It's alcoholic gastritis.
I'll get better soon with medicine.

107
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,429
Just letting you know that
I don't have an incurable disease.

108
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,390
Thank you.

109
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,351
If you ask me what I'm thankful for,

110
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,354
there are so many reasons.
So I'd say, for everything.

111
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,482
Take care not to catch a cold, Su-hyeok.

112
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,863
And let's not see each other ever again.

113
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,716
It was dying,
but your curse brought it back to life.

114
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,176
Totally amazing, right?

115
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,971
So tough.

116
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:43,727
Yes, live long.
You endured all that hatred.

117
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,355
Cheers.

118
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,693
By the way, are you okay?

119
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,488
Hey, gastritis is no big deal.

120
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,368
So amazing.

121
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,328
I feel proud.

122
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,038
Despite all those insults.

123
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,315
-Hurry up.
-Here.

124
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,375
Are you going to throw all these away?

125
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,670
It's just stuff.
It doesn't matter who gave it.

126
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,380
You don't need to do this.

127
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,925
I'm throwing them away.

128
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,804
-Such a waste.
-Nope.

129
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,977
While I'm at it, I'll clean out my closet
to throw away what I don't wear anymore.

130
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,899
This is what I bought!

131
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,066
I bought this one.

132
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,277
Put them out while I sort this out.

133
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,115
-Put out the other bag too.
-Okay.

134
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,406
I want to get a refund, please.

135
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,954
I'm sorry, sir,

136
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,374
but do you mind me asking
why you want a refund?

137
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:58,880
If it's because the ring doesn't fit,

138
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,633
we can have it resized.

139
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,093
Please, visit us together.

140
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,678
The thing is...

141
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,392
We can't come together...

142
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,479
The one who's supposed to be the recipient

143
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,357
declined to receive it.

144
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,489
In other words,

145
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,660
we broke up.

146
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,789
More precisely, she dumped me.

147
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,332
What?

148
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,631
However, sir,

149
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,760
all diamond accessories
are non-refundable,

150
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,180
as you can see in this receipt.

151
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,850
Of course I saw that.

152
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:56,229
I thought maybe we can find more leeway
if we discuss this in person.

153
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,169
Let me help you, U-ri.

154
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,378
It's okay.

155
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,756
I got this. I will do it.

156
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,424
It's so heavy...

157
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,676
What are you doing?
Come help her a little.

158
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,470
You can help each other.

159
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,429
Sang-jin.

160
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,265
This is my job.

161
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,808
I can do it.

162
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,018
It's okay.

163
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,690
Okay.

164
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,959
Are you okay?

165
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,252
Did you get hurt?

166
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,048
Your feet.

167
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,050
Goodness.

168
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,134
It's all right.

169
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,928
What are you doing? Bring it.

170
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,431
-You need to be careful.
-Watch out.

171
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,684
-Move.
-Come here.

172
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,435
-Come here.
-I'm sorry.

173
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,022
-Aren't you hurt?
-I'm sorry.

174
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,023
It's okay.

175
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,942
Over there.

176
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,777
So heavy.

177
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,452
I'll have cold naengmyeon.

178
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,329
Assorted pork cutlets, please.

179
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,956
I'll have galbi-tang.

180
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,624
Perilla seed tofu stew please.

181
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,086
Kimchi stew for five people, ma'am.

182
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,757
It's a perfect day for kimchi stew.
Nice and spicy.

183
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,175
You know what I mean?

184
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,678
-You're right.
-Sounds so good.

185
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,595
Ma'am.

186
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,639
One rolled omelet as well.

187
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,267
-Please cut it evenly into five pieces.
-Yeah.

188
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,561
Okay.

189
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,521
Thank you.

190
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,657
I forgot my cell phone.

191
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,619
I'll drop by the office.

192
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,329
Let it simmer.

193
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,831
Let it simmer for long.

194
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,291
Wait, I'll be back in a bit.

195
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,251
Wait for me.

196
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:59,746
No, I'm really okay.

197
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
Come on in.

198
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,210
How were you going to work like that?

199
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,379
This is so you aren't disrupted.
So no pressure.

200
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,883
Think of it as a uniform.

201
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,428
-I see.
-Go pick one.

202
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,556
We don't have time.

203
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,458
Thank you.

204
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,044
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

205
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,671
Where's the syrup?

206
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,761
-Let's go, U-ri.
-Okay.

207
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,560
Syrup, please.

208
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,984
I have to have my coffee.

209
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,360
What?

210
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,572
-I hope I'm not wasting your time.
-Not at all.

211
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,824
I really, really love it.

212
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,077
Having a coffee outside like this

213
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,163
makes me feel like I'm a grown-up
who works in an office.

214
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,748
I'm really happy.

215
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,217
I looked like a fool earlier, right?

216
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,512
I guess I wanted to do well.

217
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,059
I know.

218
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,146
That's the problem with
young people these days.

219
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,064
You try too hard to do well.

220
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,691
You can cut corners.

221
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,818
Looks like you didn't know.

222
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,362
U-ri, you are doing a heck of a job.

223
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,123
I mean it.

224
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,252
Thank you.

225
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,174
Thank you for this pretty dress and coffee

226
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,009
and encouraging me all the time.

227
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,847
So I have something for you too.

228
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:24,057
One moment, please.

229
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,019
Here, Sang-jin.

230
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,817
It's my heart, Sang-jin.

231
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,076
Thank you, U-ri.

232
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,413
Shall we go now?

233
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,166
Okay.

234
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,475
So this is your uniform?

235
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,228
Yes, Sang-jin bought it for me earlier.

236
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,625
Sang-jin!

237
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,132
-What is that?
-What?

238
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:40,925
What are you doing?

239
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:42,927
Well...

240
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,639
What do you think it is? It's a heart.

241
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,646
Coworkers can show
some affection like this.

242
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,733
-Don't you think?
-Nope.

243
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:00,778
A heart between coworkers? Unacceptable.
I find it offensive, so please don't.

244
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,657
And, Sang-jin...

245
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,828
Making workers wear uniforms
based on their gender or position,

246
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,997
don't you find it problematic?

247
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,541
-Don't you?
-Su-hyeok.

248
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,046
Especially, that kind of uniform.

249
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,631
How could you make her wear that?

250
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,011
This is what I chose.

251
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:28,347
I like it very much.

252
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,434
Is it that weird?

253
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,313
What?

254
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,198
No way.

255
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:51,871
U-ri.

256
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,169
Are you trying to
ride on his coattails already?

257
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,005
This is really disappointing.

258
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,883
No, that's really not it.

259
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,889
You don't know what you're talking about.

260
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,353
Where have you been? You said you
parted with Ms. Yeon a while ago.

261
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,856
I had some errands to run.

262
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,110
What errands would that be?

263
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,197
Did you go to get a refund for the ring?

264
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,621
-That's ridiculous.
-I'm telling you this

265
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,998
since it really seems like you'll go.

266
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,793
Diamond rings are non-refundable.

267
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,545
That's why it's risky.

268
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:45,716
On that note, I prefer bags.
It's exchangeable, refundable.

269
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,927
If you luckily get it back,
you can sell it.

270
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,973
The prices go up as well.
It's a good investment. How great is that?

271
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,683
I see.

272
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,269
Good for you.

273
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,855
That ring, Young Radish it.

274
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,275
-What?
-Don't you know Young Radish?

275
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,778
The final destination
of the spoils of a breakup.

276
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,934
POST MY ITEMS

277
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,494
Gifts from my ex-boyfriend.

278
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,580
Selling at a real bargain.

279
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,875
Need it off my hands. It sickens me.
Price is non-negotiable.

280
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:27,235
Dear Deborah,
I hope this message finds you well.

281
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,319
I'm a longtime fan.

282
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,780
I mustered the courage to DM you.

283
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,074
I wonder if you're doing well.

284
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:36,494
I recently broke up with
my boyfriend of many years.

285
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:40,665
Before marriage,
he moved on to another woman instantly.

286
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,418
He said he wanted to
break up on my birthday.

287
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,672
We were doing fine till the day before.

288
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,342
Then he ghosted me and said
he wanted to end the relationship.

289
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,262
He said he couldn't go on.

290
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,098
He wants to see someone else.

291
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:59,767
He said he was tired of trying.

292
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:06,023
He said he couldn't picture a happy future
with me. Those words are traumatic for me.

293
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,653
I feel like the ground
I'm standing on is crumbling.

294
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,656
It feels like all our memories
are being denied.

295
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:17,493
I feel miserable like I'm dying.
My self-esteem hit rock bottom.

296
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:21,539
I hate myself for still missing my ex.

297
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,128
I ended up crying my eyes out
at a blind date.

298
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:31,924
We were together during my prime,
when I was the most beautiful.

299
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,218
If I move on from him,

300
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:38,389
it feels like that part of me
would disappear. I'm so scared of that.

301
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,351
Will there be someone somewhere
who will love me?

302
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,400
Every day is a struggle to survive.
Can I ever move on?

303
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,362
I thought that I was the only one
who got abandoned

304
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,781
and that it happened
because I was worthless.

305
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,705
But when I heard about
what happened to you,

306
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,124
I felt comforted,
though it's selfish of me.

307
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,921
I hope you and me, and everybody
will become happy, Deborah.

308
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,844
Then I'll be able to
endure this time with hope.

309
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,976
As a writer, isn't it your duty

310
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,937
to think about how irresponsible
a sudden sad ending is?

311
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,231
Do you know why it is bad?

312
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:33,444
People hope for things to work out
and wounds to heal.

313
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:37,198
And with all this, as a better person,
for life to move on.

314
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,910
You're taking those hopes away.

315
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,341
Are you Young Radish?

316
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,425
-No.
-I'm sorry.

317
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,223
-Young Radish?
-Yes, Young Radish.

318
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,725
Go ahead and check.

319
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,695
It's correct. Hope you enjoy the bag.

320
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,947
-Thank you.
-No problem.

321
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,036
Look how much I made today.

322
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,005
Insufficient balance on the card.

323
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,966
Hang on.

324
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,343
For two people, please.

325
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,638
Paid for multiple passengers.

326
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,056
-Thank you.
-No problem.

327
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,111
For two, please.

328
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,363
Paid for multiple passengers.

329
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,917
DON'T PICK UP SOLDIER

330
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,422
I was afraid he'd persistently bother me.

331
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,007
He gave up quite easily.

332
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:19,967
Young Radish!

333
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,097
Would this fit a man?

334
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,150
It's oversized, so it should fit.

335
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,489
Take a look at the bathroom. This way.

336
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:42,656
Oh, my!

337
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,451
Look. A large bathtub.

338
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,535
Here.

339
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,454
It's perfect for a bubble bath.

340
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,418
-Let's look at the master bedroom...
-Okay.

341
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:59,924
Here. This room is facing south,
so it has tons of natural sunlight.

342
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,343
-It's the bed I really wanted.
-This way.

343
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,094
Let's buy one.

344
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,263
I really love this place, honey.

345
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,598
It's nice, right?

346
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,351
This way. Shall we look at the small room?

347
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,268
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:15,105
This small room should make
a perfect nursery.

349
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,775
It's furnished in here as well.

350
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,860
We really could make it a nursery.

351
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,946
You'll have a baby soon, right?

352
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,073
When do you think you can move in?

353
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,534
The earlier the better for us.

354
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,452
I'll do as she wishes.

355
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,954
Sounds great!

356
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,207
They'll move in soon.

357
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,750
Come to the office quickly.

358
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,168
Okay.

359
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,294
Let's go.

360
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,380
Thank you.

361
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:40,756
You're here.

362
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,133
-Bye.
-Bye.

363
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,261
Good.

364
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,639
What's going on? Are we moving?

365
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,267
Yes, where have you been?

366
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,602
I just went out for a bit.

367
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,522
Want to come along? For a house-hunt.

368
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,400
No, I'm tired. I'll stay.

369
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,651
Okay, I'll call you.

370
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,319
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

371
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,073
-Pick up the phone.
-Okay, good luck.

372
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,700
-Okay.
-Okay.

373
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:14,081
As for the location, I want somewhere
not so far from our current place.

374
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,500
There has to be at least two bedrooms.

375
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:20,254
It has to be move-in ready.
There has to be nothing to repair.

376
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,592
I hope it includes all appliances,
so I won't have to buy any.

377
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,219
Two-bedroom, all renovated,

378
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,139
long-term rental deposit,
appliances included.

379
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,933
And the most important thing.
What's the budget?

380
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,687
Around the deposit for the current house?

381
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,024
House prices soared over the years.

382
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:44,903
Lease prices soared too, of course.
That deposit is nowhere near enough.

383
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,282
-Is that so?
-Of course.

384
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,951
I told you. You should have
bought that house.

385
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,246
You could have owned it
with the deposit and a small loan.

386
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,041
That way, it would have doubled,
I mean, tripled.

387
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,377
You extended the contract by a year
'cause you'd get married soon.

388
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,589
By the way,
what happened to your marriage?

389
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,968
It just... turned out like this.

390
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,221
You trusted a man, of all things?

391
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:15,184
You should've trusted real estate.
Real estate never betrays.

392
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,519
-Right?
-You bet.

393
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,487
It's just like the previous one.

394
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,530
It's quite well-renovated.

395
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,033
No. No, it isn't.

396
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,243
You don't even
need to see this one. Hurry.

397
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,496
There's no elevator either?

398
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,497
Goodness.

399
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,248
I'll call you later.

400
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,249
Okay.

401
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,335
This one isn't bad.

402
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,962
They won't cut the price that much.

403
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:46,340
Well, then...

404
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,009
It's too big anyway.

405
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,178
All the appliances are included.

406
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,098
The landlord will provide a fridge.

407
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:59,311
-Why is this place so cheap?
-I guess the landlord needs quick cash.

408
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:01,730
Where else can you find a cheaper place?

409
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:02,898
Let's go.

410
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,608
Where?

411
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,361
Want to see the small bedroom?

412
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:09,697
Oh, my!

413
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,281
What is this?

414
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:15,786
Why did they just leave that there?

415
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,955
Nothing's working today.

416
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,917
Where are you going?

417
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:26,296
Where are you going?
There's one more unit I have for you.

418
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,175
Vintage and nice, right?

419
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:31,343
No?

420
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,097
It's better than the others, at least.

421
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,558
I'll go with this place.

422
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:42,604
I did let you see this place,
but someone else is actually interested.

423
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,482
They said they'd sign later.
Not sure if it'd be okay.

424
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:49,653
They haven't signed yet.

425
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,739
Come on.

426
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,906
Let's go.

427
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:54,950
Whatever.

428
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,161
-Let's go.
-Let's go to the office.

429
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,050
Su-hyeok, are you busy now?

430
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,347
Young Radish!

431
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,229
Can we meet up for the item today?

432
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,195
I'm paying with my part-time job money.
Any room for negotiation?

433
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,535
I'll give you a 5,000 won discount.

434
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,037
But no more.

435
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:45,501
My payday is a week later.

436
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,003
Is it okay to give you the money then?

437
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,506
What? What's up with this guy?

438
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,132
He's so annoying.

439
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:53,550
BO-RA
NEW MESSAGE

440
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,637
My sis, where are you?

441
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,847
I'm at home.

442
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,934
What about you? How's house-hunting going?

443
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,770
Yeah, by the way, I'm in trouble.

444
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,563
I have to make a deposit now.

445
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:09,900
But my online banking isn't working.

446
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,236
Can you send the deposit for me?

447
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:18,200
Deposit? Are you signing the lease today?

448
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,119
Yeah, so we need to wire the money now.

449
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,830
I'm in a hurry.

450
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:28,085
What do I do then?
Your card is at home, right?

451
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,211
How much?

452
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:32,965
It's 40 million won.

453
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,633
Wire it to this account.

454
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:38,220
It's 072-7943687-856.

455
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,013
Hanul Bank, Choi Byeong-sik.

456
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,310
Is Choi Byeong-sik the landlord?

457
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,604
Yes.

458
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,194
Okay, I'll call you when I go to the bank.

459
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,073
No, I dropped my cell phone,

460
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,118
cracked my phone screen
and calls got spotty.

461
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,287
Text me once you do it.

462
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,623
Okay.

463
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,168
Jeez. Feel so lazy to go out.

464
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:20,554
Please do your best to complete
the test and survey for this month.

465
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,264
-Okay.
-What is this?

466
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,143
This month's Editor's Beauty Laboratory
topic is anti-aging.

467
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,644
Hey, then is this...

468
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,855
-Right.
-Awesome.

469
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,440
Thank you.

470
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,446
What are you doing, Yu-jeong? You busy?

471
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,531
Busy? Is she really asking?

472
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,161
Hey, Yu-jeong.

473
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,954
You must know better.

474
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,790
Are you asking me
because you really don't know?

475
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:49,875
What?

476
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,127
Where are you?

477
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,630
WOO BAR
COFFEE AND WINE

478
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,470
Do you need anything else?

479
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,221
No, we're okay.

480
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,850
He's our new part-timer.

481
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,187
Say hi. This is our obnoxious customer
you'll get to see a lot.

482
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,355
Hello.

483
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:13,482
Hello.

484
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,529
It's you, right?

485
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,282
I'm a huge fan.

486
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,535
I saw your radio shows
and columns even in the army.

487
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,539
You look so beautiful in person.

488
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,000
Thanks.

489
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,882
Oh, my.

490
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,218
You hired a great guy.

491
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,302
Don't be fooled.

492
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:45,472
He just got out of the army.
Everything is beautiful to him.

493
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,267
Anyways, good thing you found a new place.

494
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,061
Don't even get me started.

495
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:55,440
I scraped all my savings together
to pay for the deposit.

496
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,652
You must have saved up
quite a lot of money.

497
00:37:58,735 --> 00:37:59,945
What about all that?

498
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,031
It hasn't been long
since I made decent money.

499
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,242
I kept blowing my paycheck.

500
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,789
To be a good daughter before marriage,
I helped my parents out with their house.

501
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:15,168
After penalties for cancelled events,
sponsors, and ads,

502
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,753
there's not much left.

503
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,882
Why was I so reckless with money?

504
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,345
Was it because I thought I'd be okay
financially if I married Ju-wan?

505
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,139
Come on.

506
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,101
You're okay for now,
but I guess you need to work soon.

507
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:33,228
Right.

508
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,439
I want to work, to be honest.

509
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,441
I have to.

510
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,277
But I can't.

511
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,446
I don't know.

512
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:44,906
Just do it.

513
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,286
Don't get stressed out.
It'll make you age faster.

514
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,501
I wasn't going to show you this.

515
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,753
Hold on.

516
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,723
This shortens the skin cell turnover,

517
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:13,185
boosts collagen production,
and even has antioxidants.

518
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,312
The ultimate anti-aging product.

519
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,814
It's called "baby face cream."

520
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,775
It hasn't been released yet.

521
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,402
Sorry. Not interested, ma'am.

522
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:25,739
It doesn't make sense.
Everyone can get younger with this?

523
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,324
Just take a leap of faith.

524
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,035
To look younger at our age,
we can do anything.

525
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,287
"We"? Why?

526
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,123
I'm happy with how I look.

527
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,501
I look like my age
and that's not a problem.

528
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:42,339
All right, every person has
their own standard of beauty.

529
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:48,512
Why do you wanna look younger
all of a sudden?

530
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,098
You still want to look pretty for Jin-woo?

531
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,933
Pretty, my foot.

532
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,602
For him? We're just brothers.

533
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,567
He called me "brother."

534
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,321
He said, "Brother, come on in."

535
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,532
Really?

536
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,785
Come on.

537
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,454
Doesn't look like a bromance to me.

538
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,665
You didn't know? We're playing pretend.

539
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,877
I can't stand lovers' quarrel.

540
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,849
Hey, what is this?

541
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,019
Yu-jeong, are you busy?

542
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,105
You left me on read.

543
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,773
What the heck?

544
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:45,026
I have a favor to ask. It's urgent.

545
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,571
I didn't send you this.
Did you just get it?

546
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,660
Someone is impersonating you.

547
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,205
What, then it wasn't you
who texted me earlier?

548
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,959
I didn't...

549
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,836
I didn't text you today.

550
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,088
Oh, my goodness!

551
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,382
I got goosebumps.

552
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,676
Hey, this is that thing.

553
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,052
What's it called?

554
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,095
Messenger phishing.

555
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:27,986
There are scammers impersonating me
sending private messages to my friends.

556
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,321
Ignore those messages.

557
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:33,700
I suspect it's messenger phishing
that tricks you to send money.

558
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,038
-I'm back.
-Hey.

559
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,707
Why is the house so clean?

560
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,793
-Bo-ra, what's this?
-What?

561
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,923
Someone texted Yu-jeong,
pretending like they're me.

562
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,382
Just to be safe.

563
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,220
Got your phone fixed already?

564
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:56,306
-You cracked your screen.
-When? What are you talking about?

565
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,985
Bo-ra.

566
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,072
How did house-hunting go?

567
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,531
It went well.

568
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:20,372
Okay, so... you signed a lease?

569
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:24,376
Lease? I was going to sign it today,
but the landlord is out of town.

570
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,669
We'll sign it next week.

571
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,004
Let's go check out
the place together then.

572
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,465
What do you mean? You didn't sign it yet?

573
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,301
What?

574
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,262
The deposit was 40 million won.

575
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,347
You asked me to transfer 40 million won.

576
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,433
I transferred the money
to the landlord with your card.

577
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,770
The landlord's name is Choi Byeong-sik.
Isn't it?

578
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,525
What are you talking about?
I never texted you.

579
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,444
What 40 million won?

580
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,905
I sent you messages earlier. Check.

581
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,078
Hello?

582
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:01,663
Hello?

583
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,333
I just saw your message.

584
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:08,670
I'll call you back unless this is urgent.

585
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,798
-I'm in the middle of something.
-No, please wait.

586
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,466
You texted me earlier, right?

587
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:16,970
So the person who asked me for a favor

588
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,596
was you, right?

589
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,808
I didn't text you. What favor?

590
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:33,069
What about my money then?

591
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,324
What about my money?

592
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,410
My five million won.

593
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,958
Security Bank representative,
this is Park Shin-hyung.

594
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,295
It has come to our attention
that a deposit

595
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:54,341
was made into your account
from an unreliable source.

596
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,343
If it's left unverified,

597
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:58,887
it could be classified
as a phony bank account.

598
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,181
You could even face legal charges.

599
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,977
Let me verify your
bank account number first. It's 012...

600
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:08,605
Su-hyeok, are you busy now?

601
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,151
No, what's up?

602
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,743
I was just wondering
if you could do me a favor.

603
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,412
I need to wire some money urgently,

604
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:26,373
but due to my circumstances...

605
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,416
Could you send some money for me?

606
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,812
It's only about five million won.

607
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:51,648
I'll pay you back tomorrow morning.

608
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,332
Send me your bank account number.

609
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,132
CYBER CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM

610
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:21,594
Messenger phishing usually involves
a small sum to make it easy to withdraw.

611
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,638
In your case, you're signing a lease,

612
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,516
so they asked for a large amount,
causing more damage.

613
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,395
How did they know we were signing a lease?

614
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:34,149
They didn't know
until you said it yourself.

615
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,491
For now, the report has been filed.

616
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,119
If there's money left
in the suspended account,

617
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,787
you could get it back.

618
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,749
But it's been quite a while,

619
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,419
so it's safe to assume
it's already been withdrawn.

620
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,714
What do I do then?

621
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,721
What about the other victim?

622
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,892
He's on the way.

623
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,154
Is it voice phishing?

624
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,071
Yes.

625
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,868
Which one? Mortgage fraud
or government impersonation scam?

626
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:28,995
Family, friend impersonation.

627
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:30,955
Goodness.

628
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,375
Young people these days are
on their smartphones all the time.

629
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,044
How can they be so clueless?

630
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:40,173
Despite all the awareness campaigns
and news reports,

631
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:44,010
they fall victim to voice phishing

632
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,931
that even the elderly in their 90s
don't fall for.

633
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,476
What's the world coming to?

634
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,644
I know.

635
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,229
That's why, young lady,

636
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:58,024
you shouldn't just watch dramas.
Watch the news sometimes.

637
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:02,403
And go out there
and learn the ways of the world.

638
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:03,571
How frustrating.

639
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,406
Excuse me.

640
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:07,408
What did you just say?

641
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,036
You cannot put it that way.

642
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:14,165
She doesn't just watch dramas.

643
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,750
She watches the news all the time.

644
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,963
That's not what I meant, ma'am.

645
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:24,676
I said that because I felt so sorry.

646
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,095
"Sorry"?

647
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,681
You felt sorry?

648
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,433
Is that the attitude of someone
who feels sorry?

649
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,769
Bo-ra, stop.

650
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,771
It's my fault.

651
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,107
It's not your fault.

652
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,362
And why do you call me "ma'am"?

653
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,698
You trying to be respectful or sarcastic?

654
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,160
-Madam.
-I'm not a madam.

655
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,078
Jeez...

656
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,872
How may I address you then?

657
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,041
I know you'd hate to hear "miss."

658
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,669
Why? I am a miss. Why would I hate it?

659
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,385
What I'm trying to tell you is...

660
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,639
even the police could be robbed. Right?

661
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,392
Doctors could get sick.

662
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:17,520
Lawyers could be conned.
That's the way it is.

663
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,356
It's not because she's ignorant or dumb.

664
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,026
She just fell for it
as they elaborately planned it.

665
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,070
The scammers are in the wrong,
not the victims.

666
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,538
How can I help you?

667
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,166
I'm Lee Su-hyeok.

668
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,527
Stop crying.

669
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,364
It's okay. It's not your fault.
Let's go home.

670
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,825
No, I won't go home
until we get the money back.

671
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:31,219
So you thought I was asking you
to lend me money,

672
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,471
and wired five million won?

673
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,392
Why?

674
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,811
Why did you send so much money like that?

675
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,270
You could have said no.

676
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:44,315
Or you could have called me
and asked me why.

677
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:46,651
-If you did that...
-You said it was urgent.

678
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,612
I thought it was so urgent
that you had to ask me,

679
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:52,949
there must be a reason,
and maybe you had no one else to ask.

680
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,492
That's why I didn't call you.

681
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,996
Then, you could have called me
after sending the money.

682
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,583
You could've gotten the money back,
had they known sooner.

683
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,836
You said you couldn't talk on the phone.

684
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,134
By the way, are you saying it's my fault?

685
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:16,556
No, that's not what I meant.

686
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,560
There's no way I would
borrow money from you.

687
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,979
We're not that close.

688
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:26,315
You could have suspected
something was wrong.

689
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,067
That's what I'm saying.

690
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:32,363
You know how many things
were wrong with you?

691
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,620
You fall, curse, cry anywhere,
get drunk and be a mess.

692
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:42,415
I've seen all sorts of stuff.

693
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,251
Why would I think
asking for money was weird?

694
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,837
I thought it was
the most normal thing you've done.

695
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:51,257
I told you to pass me by.

696
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,012
Even if you see me cry or fall somewhere,

697
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:59,640
and even if I get hit by a car,
I said you should pass me by.

698
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,894
Yes, that's right.

699
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,481
It is my fault.

700
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,988
It's obviously my fault
for not double-checking.

701
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,699
I won't hold you accountable
for the damage.

702
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:19,327
We don't need to
see each other again, right?

703
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,872
But...

704
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,041
But...

705
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,746
Aren't you going to eat?

706
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,749
Shall we have some barbecue you like?

707
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,835
No.

708
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:11,254
I don't deserve it.

709
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:18,553
Seeing you like this
makes me really worried.

710
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,391
I'm sorry for making you worry

711
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,395
and for losing the money.

712
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,114
Look at this. Unbelievable.

713
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:43,160
"Voice phishing,
even doctors got scammed."

714
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,830
Oh, my goodness.

715
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:48,416
Doctors, office workers,
government employees,

716
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,834
even reporters got conned.

717
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,920
Even lawyers got scammed?

718
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,092
No way, Tang Wei got scammed too.

719
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,554
You know Tang Wei, right?
She's really famous.

720
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,557
There's no way you can avoid this.

721
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,852
Anyone can get scammed helplessly
when they're targeted.

722
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,896
-Really?
-Yes.

723
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,689
See?

724
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,442
It says so.

725
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:17,445
You're right.

726
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,594
Just chipping in for moving.

727
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,221
You must be short of money.

728
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,223
What's this?

729
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,103
Hey.

730
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,525
Were you worried about that?

731
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,153
Were you worried we'd become homeless?

732
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:06,327
I have money. A lot.

733
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,870
Don't you worry.

734
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,997
-Really?
-Of course.

735
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,043
Goodness.

736
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,546
By the way, where did you get this money?

737
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,551
The thing is...

738
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,889
Ex-boyfriend collection.
Selling at a real bargain after breakup.

739
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,766
Why did you write this?

740
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,853
Hey...

741
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,649
Why'd you list this so cheap?
It was really expensive.

742
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,734
It's the current market price.

743
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,571
Why isn't this sold yet?
It's a brand-new model.

744
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:45,616
Is it too expensive?
Should we cut down 30,000 won?

745
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,576
For this...

746
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,999
-Just 20,000 won.
-Just 20,000 won? Okay.

747
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,134
My goodness.

748
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,345
Hey, let's go.

749
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,265
Let's go have some barbecue.

750
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,685
Looks like we won't starve at least.

751
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:13,853
Keep it.

752
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,189
-You must be so hungry, you cried so much.
-I'm hungry.

753
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:26,407
My contact list got hacked.

754
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,659
Had I checked my emails sooner...

755
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,786
Is Bo-mi okay now?

756
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,205
You got mad and yelled at her, didn't you?

757
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:36,625
I would have yelled
if she lost four million won.

758
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,462
You can't do that to someone
who lost 40 million.

759
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:42,548
She cries just at the sound
of message alerts or calls.

760
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,549
My goodness...

761
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:48,137
Forty million won
is someone's annual income.

762
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,264
Are you going to be okay with moving?

763
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,018
Not one bit.
I'm about to end up on the streets.

764
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:58,731
What do I do? The moving date is set
already as I was going to sign a lease.

765
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:02,651
How can I find another house?
My budget is lower now.

766
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,153
Then what do we do?

767
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,238
I don't have spare money at hand.

768
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:10,117
Or should I talk to Jin-woo
and use a line of credit?

769
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:11,327
AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE

770
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:18,125
Hello? Bo-ra?

771
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,461
Hello?

772
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,755
-Yu-jeong.
-Yes.

773
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:26,383
You know President Han
of the publishing company.

774
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,052
Is he really credible?

775
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,722
Does that publishing company
have deep pockets for its size?

776
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:32,932
President Han?

777
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,184
He's got rich investors.

778
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:38,270
He came from quite a wealthy family too.
They own buildings.

779
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:40,523
He owns the publishing company building.

780
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:46,070
He's an almighty building owner.

781
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,697
Yes, but why?

782
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:51,742
Now that you know, are you interested?
Gonna lure him?

783
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,954
Would it work?

784
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:11,679
No.

785
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,438
Where are you? Are you at work?

786
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:22,565
Yes.

787
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,571
SANG-JIN
NEW MESSAGE

788
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:31,657
I'm in a rush,
make a deposit to my account.

789
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,576
For what?

790
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,958
SANG-JIN
NEW MESSAGE

791
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,710
I just got an amazing tip-off.

792
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,420
My security card isn't with me.

793
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,297
Anyways, do that right away.

794
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:52,219
HOW MUCH?

795
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,521
SANG-JIN

796
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:08,819
Can't talk right now. Text me afterward.

797
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:18,204
Jeez...

798
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,667
Yes, Taean Bio.

799
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,629
It's a hot tip, so mum's the word.

800
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,505
Buy it as soon as the market opens.

801
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:29,965
It'll double, at least.

802
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,342
Yeah.

803
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:37,097
Don't share this with anyone. Okay?

804
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:41,977
Okay, I'm working out.
I'll call you later.

805
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,822
If you need money, try to work for it.

806
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,783
Don't rip others off for easy money.

807
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,952
You'll be severely punished.

808
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:00,246
What the...

809
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:05,000
You don't even deserve my insults.
Get your life together.

810
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:11,048
Do I look like a pushover?

811
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,259
I won't fall for it again.

812
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,558
-What?
-You jerk, what? "Get your life together"?

813
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:25,437
I've gone too easy on you.
You're out of your mind. Wait right there.

814
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:27,731
You're done for. Stay in the office.

815
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:30,150
I'm on my way. You're dead.

816
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:33,946
Sang-jin!

817
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,927
About Taean Bio...

818
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,930
It didn't rise that much.

819
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,017
We cool?

820
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:06,895
You made me feel humiliated.

821
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,608
I'm sorry.

822
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:14,236
I thought it was voice phishing...

823
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,406
I thought it was, that's why.

824
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:20,743
Voice phishing?

825
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,496
Is that your excuse?

826
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,581
Voice phishing...

827
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,292
I gave you my account.
How is that voice phishing?

828
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,710
What do you take me for?

829
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:35,382
What do you take me for
to suspect voice phishing at that moment?

830
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,717
The thing is...

831
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:41,764
All right.

832
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:46,477
I got scammed
by voice phishing the other day.

833
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:49,063
So I'm a little on edge.

834
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,648
What, voice phishing?

835
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,320
What? Voice phishing?

836
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,407
Why? How?

837
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:03,744
How much?

838
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:10,834
It's okay. It happens.

839
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:12,836
Su-hyeok. It's me, okay?

840
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,838
You can pour your heart out to me.

841
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:17,966
You're acting out of character.
So down-to-earth.

842
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,804
It's all...

843
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,139
It's all because of Deborah.

844
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,245
Once again, let me make this clear.

845
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:49,665
I have no inclination
to make a fool out of myself again.

846
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,792
I'm financially stable enough.

847
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,962
I don't need to use my past,
stories, or tears to make a living.

848
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,964
There's no chance I'll work with you.

849
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:01,760
Why did I have to go that far?

850
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,180
We don't need to
see each other again, right?

851
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,986
If I don't sign this contract today,
I'll end up on the streets.

852
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,822
Let's focus on that.

853
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:26,076
Today, I, Deborah, have no shame.

854
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,903
Knock, knock, this is Deborah.

855
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:03,197
Please put your bad-mouthing on hold.

856
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,115
I'm opening the door right now.

857
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,791
I suddenly really want to do it.

858
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,379
Why don't we do it together?

859
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,046
TRUE TO LOVE

860
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:03,465
Let's remember these members!

861
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:05,676
Now we're really working together.

862
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,970
If we're doing it,
let's do it properly. Shall we?

863
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,765
Drawn by irresistible destiny,
you get closer,

864
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,600
and end up meeting each other.

865
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,310
That is real destiny.

866
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:19,022
When will you believe we're destined?
If we meet again, will you believe?

867
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,024
If we do, you must go out with me.

868
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:23,318
Don't follow me, or I'll kill you.

869
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:24,903
I woke up this morning,

870
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:27,447
and for the first time,
I didn't think about Ju-wan.

871
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,658
-How drunk were you? On the streets...
-Be quiet!

872
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:32,619
-I can't face him.
-What kind of excuse will she make now?

873
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,080
He'll take a hint and won't reach out.

874
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,915
He can't take a hint.

875
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,878
You're looking for a room?
I thought I could only see you this way.
