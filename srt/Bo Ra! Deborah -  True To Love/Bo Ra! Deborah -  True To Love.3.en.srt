THE END OF A PATHETIC RELATIONSHIP

5
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,461
Bo-ra, Bo-ra...

6
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,677
What brings you here out of the blue?

7
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,848
I know, right?
Why did I come here out of the blue?

8
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,849
So I'll just go.

9
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,976
You can't go like this.

10
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,028
Caught him in the act.

11
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,656
What's next, a slap in the face?

12
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,575
A kick in the shin?

13
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,331
You told me to understand
and be patient 'cause you're busy.

14
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,582
Was that for this?

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,919
Not knowing that, I...

16
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,882
How could you do this to me?

17
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,800
How could you do this?

18
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,471
Why is she crying here?

19
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,181
It's not what you think.

20
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,141
Let go of me.

21
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,143
Calm down a little.

22
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,105
Let's go inside. Let's go inside and talk.

23
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,736
Wipe your lips first.

24
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,411
Bo-ra. It's been awhile.

25
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,627
You're out of your mind.
She's your cousin.

26
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,472
Cousin...

27
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,225
That's straight-up twisted.

28
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,268
She's not?

29
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,484
You've fooled me.

30
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,695
No, I didn't.

31
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,948
I didn't say she's my cousin.
I said she's...

32
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,283
a daughter of my auntie.

33
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,204
My mom and his mom are close,
so we call each other's mom "Auntie."

34
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:52,042
I'm sorry, but we're talking right now.

35
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,420
Can you give us a moment?

36
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:58,298
Oh, no. You must be really mad.

37
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,889
Did you cry? Why? Don't cry.

38
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,475
Da-mi, go wait in the car.

39
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,646
No, I'll just go.

40
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,356
Wait in the car.

41
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,278
-Okay.
-Okay.

42
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,914
Go home first.
I'll drop her off and come back.

43
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,499
Let's talk about us then.

44
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:37,629
What? You're going to drive her home now?

45
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,339
She needs to go home first.

46
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,508
How can I let a drunk young girl go alone?

47
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,887
Why not?

48
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,849
Why can't you let her go?
Can't she go home alone?

49
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,269
Or do you two have something
left to do in the car?

50
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,480
-What are you...
-And why call her young?

51
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,398
She's not so much younger than me.

52
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,817
I wish she didn't mention that.

53
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,739
Are you going to keep talking like this?
I said it's not what you think.

54
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,159
If it's not, what is it then?

55
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:11,497
You were kissing her in the car.
I saw it with my own eyes.

56
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,333
Then what is it that isn't what I think?

57
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,294
Okay, I did. Who said I didn't?

58
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,175
It's not what you think.
It's just a mistake. A one-time mistake.

59
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,386
It'll change nothing between us.
I'll see her again anyway.

60
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,639
I just said I'll get her home and talk.

61
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,391
You act as if
I was caught cheating on you,

62
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,436
flipping out and pushing me to the corner.

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,815
Do you have to be like this?
Put yourself in my shoes.

64
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,321
A one-time mistake?
You mean the only time you got caught?

65
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,741
Unbelievable!

66
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,576
What do you take me for?

67
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:55,749
Do you really not trust me?
You've been dating me without such trust?

68
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,544
-Is this how much I mean to you?
-What?

69
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,006
Is that why you're here?
'Cause you can't trust me?

70
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,594
Yes, you are.
You said nothing on the phone earlier.

71
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,430
Then you just showed up
unannounced at my place.

72
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,516
You've never done this before.

73
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,645
To put it bluntly, you doubted me,
so you came to catch me in the act.

74
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,523
He's such a scumbag.

75
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,863
You think that's why I came here?

76
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,244
If not...

77
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,289
Why did you come, out of the blue...

78
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,418
Sure, you're right.

79
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,337
-What?
-You're right.

80
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,550
I'm paranoid,
and because of my unfounded mistrust,

81
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,052
I planted a bug in your car

82
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,805
and came to catch you
in the act, cheating.

83
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,057
Now that it's confirmed, good.

84
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,686
Bo-ra.

85
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,730
Bo-ra.

86
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,193
You're just letting me go?

87
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,737
You'll really stay there with her?

88
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,280
Noh Ju-wan, how could you?

89
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,534
Bo-ra.

90
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,204
Don't come! I told you not to come.

91
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,876
This car is tapped.

92
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,338
She was on a high horse,
being a dating coach.

93
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,883
But she cries alone and falls...

94
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,971
What is this?

95
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,357
SANG-JIN

96
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,488
Hello?

97
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,745
Oh, Ms. Yeon?
You didn't meet Su-hyeok yet?

98
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,622
No, what about Su-hyeok?

99
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:26,001
He followed you
saying your phones were switched.

100
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,296
He did?

101
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,966
I'll call him then.

102
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,552
Okay. Bye.

103
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,346
Okay, get home safely...

104
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,729
OBNOXIOUS DEBORAH THE LIAR

105
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,238
JINLEE PUBLISHING
LEE SU-HYEOK

106
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,992
Hello, I'm the owner of the phone.

107
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,745
It says I'm
"Obnoxious Deborah the Liar" here.

108
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,954
Know who it is, right?

109
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:09,127
It seems like our phones were switched.

110
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,547
Where are you? If you're nearby, I'll go.

111
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,757
No...

112
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,346
No, I'm not nearby.

113
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,931
I'm far away. Far, far away.

114
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,728
How far away?
Are you outside Seoul already?

115
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:27,938
Well...

116
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:33,735
I have a wedding to attend
all of a sudden.

117
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,613
Wedding, come on...

118
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,283
Really? How's the weather over there?

119
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,954
It's not that different from Seoul.

120
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,834
Hello?

121
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,183
Why are you here?

122
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,352
Did you follow me?

123
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,146
No...

124
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,732
For this...

125
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,324
Yu-jeong.

126
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,369
I see that you got your phone back.

127
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,580
Yes.

128
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,541
You went to see Ju-wan, right?

129
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:33,336
What's going on?
Did you finally get a ring?

130
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,921
Tell me what happened.

131
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,301
Yu-jeong, I have low battery.
I'll call you later from home.

132
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,679
-Okay.
-Bye.

133
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,807
Call me later? I doubt it.

134
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,685
If she's there now,
she'll definitely sleep out.

135
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,941
She's probably
going to have a passionate night.

136
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,777
Jin-woo.

137
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,702
You saw everything, right?

138
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,873
Yes, accidentally.

139
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,792
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,213
Are you all right?

141
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,383
Why?

142
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:24,221
I saw you fall over big time earlier.

143
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,723
How's your wrist? Aren't you hurt?

144
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,022
Bill me for repairs.

145
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,756
Jin-woo.

146
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,945
Honey, maybe tomorrow. All right?

147
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,031
Tomorrow, I promise you. Okay?

148
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,450
I didn't say anything.

149
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,747
What, you're not sleeping?

150
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,249
Did you pretend to be asleep?

151
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,461
No, I'm sleeping. I'm sleep-talking.

152
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,422
Let's sleep. Good night.

153
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,924
Yang Jin-woo.

154
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,718
Sleep.

155
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,970
-Jin-woo.
-Sleep.

156
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,310
Sleep.

157
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,818
Are you kidding me?

158
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,279
He's totally a perverted jerk.

159
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,157
Whatever. I won't go to clubs now.

160
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,327
I think Bo-ra is here. Hang up.

161
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,950
How could you do this to me?

162
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,827
You cry, you lose.

163
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,745
Let go of me.

164
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,706
You lose your cool, you lose.

165
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,207
I'm sorry, but...

166
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,542
"I'm sorry"?

167
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,170
After seeing them sucking face,
"I'm sorry"?

168
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,841
...we're talking right now.

169
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,259
Can you give us a moment?

170
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,594
I should have lashed out at her here.

171
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,602
If it's not, what is it then?

172
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:04,774
You were kissing her in the car.
I saw it with my own eyes.

173
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,026
Then what is it that isn't what I think?

174
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,696
Am I a goat or what?
Why was my voice shaky?

175
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,657
Okay, I did. Who said I didn't?

176
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,161
At this point, I should have
at least slapped him in the face.

177
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,252
Don't come! I told you not to come.

178
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,673
It was the most tragic and
humiliating moment in my life.

179
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,217
To make matters worse,

180
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,971
there was a witness
who saw the whole thing.

181
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,639
You saw everything, right?

182
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,476
Yes, accidentally.

183
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,466
Okay.

184
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,427
What do I always emphasize?

185
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:19,265
Never stop nurturing free-flowing
communication and cooperation.

186
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,350
That being said,

187
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,020
I want to create an open-plan office,

188
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,022
removing partitions between desks

189
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,858
to get rid of all the barriers
that keep us apart.

190
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,402
What do you think, everyone?

191
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,863
-I'm not into it.
-Me neither.

192
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,448
That's not necessary.

193
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,158
We definitely need partitions.

194
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,870
Why are you so quick to answer?

195
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:47,043
If you're scared of risks, uncertainties
and changes, you can't improve.

196
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,795
I've told you repeatedly.

197
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,339
You know the late
Hyundai Group founder's famous quote?

198
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,676
"Have you tried? Have you ever tried?"

199
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,263
We shouldn't be divided
and have our backs to each other.

200
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,389
We should...

201
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,475
It's not because we fear change.

202
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,522
How about you consider it a tool
which helps protect our privacy

203
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,065
from control and spying?

204
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,067
-That's right.
-I agree.

205
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,986
I agree.

206
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,822
Mr. Han, I feel uncomfortable
when you keep staring at me.

207
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,240
So do I.

208
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,371
I said that 'cause they
seemed to feel uncomfortable.

209
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,081
What? "Spying"?

210
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,251
Everything is covered

211
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,503
so I peeked a little. Is that spying?

212
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:32,964
Is it spying?

213
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,091
Is it spying?

214
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,011
Tell me about it.

215
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,100
Still, you know
that I'm always on your side.

216
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,311
Where's this coming from?

217
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,982
Why are you so warm all of a sudden?

218
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,484
What comes around goes around.

219
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,905
If you hurt someone, you get hurt more.

220
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,114
You know what they say.

221
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,577
"If you make someone get dumped,
you could get dumped too." That is life.

222
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,288
Let's become a nice person.

223
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,123
I realized that yesterday.

224
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,249
What?

225
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,419
You still can't get over Yu-ri?

226
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,340
Why? You think
you'd win her back if you're nicer?

227
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,052
Aren't you waiting
till her cold gets worse?

228
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,054
So you can give her medicine again.

229
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,513
Absolutely not.

230
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,644
I was a fool to try to talk to you.

231
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,481
Hey. I'm not done yet.
Where are you going?

232
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,663
That poor thing. He's still not over her.

233
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,792
I'm so...

234
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,877
What is this?

235
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:59,092
Oh, no...

236
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,136
Goodness. Su-hyeok...

237
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:17,193
I fell asleep hoping this whole thing
was just a bad dream.

238
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,448
Da-mi, go wait in the car.

239
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,701
No, I'll just go.

240
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,161
It wasn't a dream.

241
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,213
So how are you
going to sort this out, Ju-wan?

242
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,514
NOTIFICATION CENTER

243
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,524
Is he not going to do anything?

244
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,026
Just pushing me aside?

245
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,738
Okay, go ahead.

246
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,540
Why are you calling?

247
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,418
I told you to take good care
of your sister.

248
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,046
Why did you chew her out?

249
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,130
What?

250
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,591
You could share your clothes and shoes.

251
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,968
If you get married,
she won't live with you.

252
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,845
Why did you have to make her cry?

253
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,347
You don't know what happened.

254
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,725
As if. I know what your temper is like!

255
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:35,396
You do that to Ju-wan too?
In front of his parents?

256
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,107
I don't know where you got that from.

257
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,443
Obviously, you! Don't you know?

258
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,653
-Whatever. Bye.
-Hey.

259
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,337
Let's go have lunch.

260
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,172
No, thank you.

261
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,758
We'll go then.

262
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,139
Sang-jin will skip lunch.

263
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,265
Let's go.

264
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,433
-All right.
-Got it.

265
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,061
-Where do you wanna go?
-There's a new stew place.

266
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,188
I wanted something else.

267
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,121
Leadership is a lonely path.

268
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:36,082
One day,
they'll understand my great cause.

269
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,137
Hang on.

270
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,972
That's not how you do it.

271
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,932
Where do you want to put it?

272
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,018
First off...

273
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,480
I'll remove all the partitions
and get rid of all these.

274
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:03,526
To do that, you need to take out
the bigger pieces first

275
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,653
before you move on.

276
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,488
Don't you have work gloves?

277
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:08,739
Work gloves?

278
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,616
Work gloves?

279
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,250
-Work gloves.
-Thank you.

280
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,545
Let's start off with
putting these umbrella things away.

281
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,754
-Okay.
-Sounds good?

282
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:24,797
All right.

283
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,976
And as for this, you have
to take this middle thing out. Hold on.

284
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,105
You'll be able to move it right away.
Go ahead.

285
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,107
-It worked, right?
-Yes.

286
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,692
Now put this away.

287
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,402
Good.

288
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,458
Okay, all done.

289
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,835
Good job. High-five!

290
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,258
How nice is this?

291
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,384
So nice.

292
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,053
It's neat.

293
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,558
-Here.
-Thank you.

294
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,936
-Thanks for your help.
-Sure, thank you.

295
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,568
I've never been
to a publishing company before.

296
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,362
It's a really cool place.

297
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,697
-You think so?
-Yes.

298
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:36,160
If I worked here, I'd be so happy
to come to work every morning.

299
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,374
That doesn't necessarily
seem like the case.

300
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,213
What kind of person
is the CEO of this company?

301
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,884
I think he'd be a brilliantly intelligent,
gentle, and cool person.

302
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,847
Yes, he sort of is.

303
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,433
He's quite good-looking and charismatic.

304
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:03,271
Really? Just as I thought.

305
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:11,070
By the way, what brought you here?

306
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,240
Where are my manners?

307
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,285
My name is Bang U-ri,
I'm here for an interview today.

308
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,203
It's great to meet you.

309
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,080
Sure.

310
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,999
But that can't be right...

311
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,041
Pardon?

312
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,337
I don't think we're hiring
'cause the CEO has no idea...

313
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,257
Excuse me?

314
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,635
I'm the CEO of this company.

315
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,470
I see.

316
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:39,807
What?

317
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,978
We apologize, there was an error
on our part.

318
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,940
The wrong company information was
given to her.

319
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:48,858
Well...

320
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,694
I'll call
and sort this out for you right now.

321
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,032
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,913
I see.

323
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,336
Okay.

324
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,755
Okay, sir.

325
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,278
I'm really sorry about earlier.

326
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,030
I had no manners.

327
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,033
Not at all. That's not a problem.

328
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,245
What work did you do?

329
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,998
As you can see in my résumé,

330
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,250
I was an office assistant
at a construction site

331
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,252
and a call center representative.

332
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,171
As for the construction site...

333
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,173
It was a container office at a site,

334
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,884
everyone was really nice
and I learned a lot.

335
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:01,013
I loved it, except for the cold in winter.

336
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:06,143
As for the call center,
it was a little rough,

337
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,937
but it is understandable.

338
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,233
Because people call
when they have complaints.

339
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,609
It was okay.

340
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,903
I see.

341
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:21,742
About earlier, I really appreciate it.

342
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,288
And the coffee was incredible.

343
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,415
Sure.

344
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,878
Wait...

345
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,172
So...

346
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,300
If you're okay with this...

347
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:39,260
Yes.

348
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,303
I didn't finish the sentence.

349
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,264
My answer is "yes," no matter what.

350
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,725
Okay.

351
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,145
If it's okay with you,
would you like to work with me?

352
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,438
For real?

353
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,107
As a temp for the six months?

354
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,235
If you work hard,
we can consider switching to full-time.

355
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,155
For real?

356
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,826
I will do my very best.

357
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,078
I will work really hard.

358
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,914
Okay.

359
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,044
It was...

360
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,215
Bang Si-ri?

361
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,720
-U-ri?
-Yes.

362
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:24,722
Let us do our best.

363
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,098
Thank you.

364
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:31,395
He said, "us."

365
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,189
Thank you.

366
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,858
The stew was really good.

367
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,403
What?

368
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,197
It's all gone.

369
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,698
Where are my partitions?

370
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,866
Where is it?

371
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,326
How can he do this?

372
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,037
It's all gone. What should I do?

373
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,831
You guys are back.
Did you enjoy your lunch?

374
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,709
How do you like it?
Refreshing, right? It's so open.

375
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,753
Mr. Han. This is not right.

376
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,630
We said we really needed partitions.

377
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,215
You can't do this.

378
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,342
No worries, it wasn't hard at all.

379
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,677
-No big deal.
-All the materials are gone.

380
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:04,887
What's the CEO for?

381
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,181
For things like this, for his employees.

382
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,141
It took me only an hour.

383
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,227
-Still...
-Aren't you motivated to work?

384
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,940
Also, U-ri here
helped me out, so it was easier.

385
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,442
Say hi, she starts work here today.

386
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,695
-Bang...
-Bang U-ri.

387
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,156
Hello, I'm Bang U-ri.

388
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,867
-Hi, everyone.
-Hello.

389
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,537
Dae-woong, give her a tour
around the office.

390
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,206
Okay, this way, please.

391
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,832
It's time to get to work.

392
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,335
Everything is still there. Look carefully.

393
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,091
This is no free-flowing communication.

394
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,677
It's not just miscommunication,
it's dictatorship.

395
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,970
RÉSUMÉ

396
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,889
Hiring through
personal connections. Perfect.

397
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,808
Hey, personal connections?

398
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,227
I just explained. Were you even listening?

399
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,189
To avoid an awkward situation,
you unexpectedly hired someone?

400
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,734
What's gotten into you?
You wanted to become a nice guy?

401
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,195
There was a proper interview process.

402
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,156
She's not scared
of challenges or trials, she loves books.

403
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,867
She'd be a great addition
to Jinlee Publishing.

404
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,536
That's why I hired her.

405
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,581
And once Deborah's project begins,

406
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:16,542
we'll need someone
to assist with the extra work load.

407
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,129
That's...

408
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,717
That's not definitely fixed.

409
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,346
It's definite. I sent her a contract.
All that's left is to get a signature.

410
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,852
What now?

411
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,439
The thing is...

412
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,067
Risk and uncertainties are always around.

413
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,917
Did you have a fight with him?

414
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:00,836
If I did?

415
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,463
Why did you fight?

416
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,843
Actually, I don't care.

417
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,178
It's obvious.

418
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,930
You must have
gone off on him over nothing.

419
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:13,557
If he calls me this time,

420
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,727
I'll tell him that he should
hang tough and not apologize.

421
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,271
'Cause you're spoiled
as he goes easy on you.

422
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,357
As if you know anything at all.

423
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,275
Then what is it?

424
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,444
No spark?

425
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,739
Right, the spark is gone.

426
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,201
You used to sleep out often,
these days you always come home.

427
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,495
You should make more of an effort.

428
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,997
Isn't it strange
he's busy all of a sudden?

429
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,755
Who is it?

430
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,881
Why do you care?

431
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,136
Don't reply to him.
This time is different.

432
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,389
I'll do what I want.

433
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,644
Come on, give it back.

434
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,770
Give it back.

435
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,398
Did you get home safely? Good morning.

436
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,316
Did you wake up early? Lunchtime.

437
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,193
-Enjoy your lunch!
-Give it back.

438
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,534
What the... Why did you check my messages!

439
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,369
I left it on unread on purpose.

440
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,995
What is wrong with you?

441
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,416
Oh, my.

442
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,961
Oh, no. It's marked as "read."

443
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,171
WOO BAR HIRING PART-TIMER

444
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:27,089
She read it.

445
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:32,928
At least, I'm not blocked.

446
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,269
It's a party co-hosted by

447
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,563
champagne brand Rosée Matinale
and La Bella.

448
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,358
Considering the golden color of champagne
and our major target group,

449
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:50,070
Gold Miss women
in their thirties or forties,

450
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,530
we came up with the concept,

451
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,907
"Golden Night, a party for Gold Misses."

452
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:58,829
The dress code is champagne gold color,
to represent La Bella's unique identity,

453
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,540
which is glamorous, gorgeous, and shiny.

454
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:04,334
We can also expect various PR benefits.

455
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,757
Part one consists of
a brass band performance

456
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,593
and a congratulatory speech
from dating coach Deborah.

457
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:16,722
The topic is, "Tips For a
Victorious Relationship for Gold Misses".

458
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,224
Part two
has a singer's special performance

459
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,851
and a party with a DJ.

460
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,561
So, what's the current status?

461
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,230
We're done securing sponsors and guests.

462
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,567
Finished confirming the guest list
and the invitation cards are out.

463
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,030
So it's almost done?

464
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,573
-Yes.
-Yes.

465
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,702
It is a big event,
so make sure to double-check everything.

466
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,661
That's all.

467
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:42,372
Thank you.

468
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:49,129
And I trust you all,
but just in case you need a reminder,

469
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,217
be sure to dress extra nicely that day.

470
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,095
There are certain expectations
for fashion magazine editors.

471
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,600
We should show how edgy
La Bella is that day, right?

472
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,811
-Okay.
-Okay.

473
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,271
I'd be relieved if they just wash up.

474
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,943
-I want to go home.
-Me too.

475
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,740
The phone is switched off,
you'll be directed to voicemail.

476
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,826
Leave your message after the tone.

477
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:32,464
Is your phone off? This is for you.

478
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,425
Who is it?

479
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,094
If you won't answer, forget it.

480
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,470
Give it to me.

481
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,771
Yu-jeong.

482
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,192
What?

483
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:56,864
So you're saying Ju-wan and Da-mi...

484
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,867
The Da-mi that I know?

485
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,038
Hey, that's messed up.

486
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,874
With his cousin, they're related...

487
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:11,211
They're not.

488
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,382
Not family, but "close like family."

489
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:19,094
He's not crazy about his work,
he's just crazy.

490
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,431
So Da-mi treated you like
you're her older sister,

491
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,058
while secretly seeing him?
What's with her?

492
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:29,313
Treating me like I'm her older sister

493
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:32,608
was her way of emphasizing,
"I'm younger than you."

494
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,610
I got goosebumps.

495
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,572
Hey, why are you so calm?

496
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,574
If not calm, should I cry?

497
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,075
Grab her by the hair?

498
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,452
Still...

499
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:46,496
How can he...

500
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,790
Isn't he nuts?

501
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:56,340
You know what Hugh Grant, Jude Law,
and Ethan Hawke have in common?

502
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,759
They all had an affair with a nanny.

503
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:04,014
Why did those successful men
cheat on their near-perfect wives?

504
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:06,975
Because they're always there.

505
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,645
They aren't opinionated,
so they're easy to handle,

506
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,105
and they seem to be
willing to do anything.

507
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:16,526
Da-mi perfectly fits the description.
So it's no wonder.

508
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,155
So what are you going to do?

509
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,199
What could I do?

510
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,743
After all we've been through,
how can we break up?

511
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,623
If he was hit by pre-marriage blues
and made one stupid mistake,

512
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,583
I could let it slide.

513
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,295
Also, I doubt that
they were sleeping together.

514
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:37,714
If they were,
they would've been in the house,

515
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,841
they wouldn't be
outside the house doing that.

516
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,512
Don't you think?

517
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,517
Sure, I doubt that too.

518
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:51,019
-Right?
-Yes.

519
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,401
In a way, it's better this way.

520
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,361
Yeah, it's a good thing.

521
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,781
He gives mixed signals to other girls,

522
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,410
he doesn't own up to his mistakes,
and he can't possibly swallow his pride.

523
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,038
I'll take this chance
to nip those habits in the bud.

524
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,915
It's a good thing.

525
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,667
Absolutely.

526
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,214
So now what, you want a drink?

527
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,969
Well, it's just that I feel like a drink.

528
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:27,180
Sure.

529
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,642
For the record,
I just feel like a drink too.

530
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,228
I won't make a fool out of myself crying.

531
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,106
-Don't bet on it.
-Of course.

532
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:37,816
Eat up.

533
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:38,900
Okay.

534
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,037
-Busy?
-You're here.

535
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,913
Wait inside, I'm closing soon.

536
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay.

537
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,014
I'm so beat.

538
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:11,600
What's up?

539
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:15,437
What about Yu-jeong?

540
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,606
What about her?

541
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:21,485
She didn't say anything?

542
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,945
Like what?

543
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,158
What's going on?

544
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,997
I need a drink.

545
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,543
Let's go somewhere nice. It's on me.

546
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:40,128
No.

547
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:43,131
I can't cry and vent out
as I want elsewhere.

548
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:46,093
Okay, let's drink, cry,
and vent out tonight.

549
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,844
It's on!

550
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,309
Hey, seems like Ju-wan is here.

551
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,690
After doing all that,
he ends up here of all places.

552
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,985
What do we do?
Should we go somewhere else?

553
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,031
Why should we? Let's go in.

554
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,077
Looks like he's planning
some strategy with Jin-woo.

555
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,038
I'm curious what they'll come up with.

556
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,269
Oh, shit.

557
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,020
Bo-ra saw?

558
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:42,440
How could you be
caught in the act like that?

559
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,192
If that happened to me...

560
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,153
I don't even want to think about it.

561
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,200
By the way, when did you start seeing her?

562
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:54,870
Did you two...

563
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,122
...do it?

564
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,625
Was this the only time?

565
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,754
I'm sure you have.
You can't say anything. You did.

566
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,382
-That's...
-No, don't.

567
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,341
Don't tell me.

568
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:11,887
Yu-jeong will question me later.
I can't keep a secret. So don't.

569
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,394
What did Bo-ra say?

570
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,608
I called but her phone was off. She
probably wants me to beg in person.

571
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,234
Then why are you here?

572
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,236
Go ask for forgiveness and make up.

573
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:30,572
What's wrong?

574
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:35,243
From my experience, when you put it off,

575
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,162
you need to deal with more charges.

576
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,079
Go.

577
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,332
If we make up this time,

578
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,628
I'd have to marry her.

579
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,715
What are you talking about?
You bought a ring.

580
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,968
Yes, I was going to marry her.

581
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,054
I could marry her.

582
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,347
But...

583
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:59,017
Now it's more clear after what happened.

584
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,605
With Bo-ra, marriage is unlikely.

585
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:07,734
What are you talking about?

586
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,069
There's no more spark?

587
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,529
You don't get butterflies anymore?

588
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:13,615
That's natural.

589
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,284
How can you always get butterflies
without a disease?

590
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,204
It's been a while since
Yu-jeong gave me butterflies.

591
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,209
I do get butterflies
when I think of marrying her.

592
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:27,879
When I wake up in the morning,
Bo-ra will be there,

593
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:31,549
holding a glass of juice
made of who-knows-what.

594
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,011
When I go home after work,
Bo-ra will be there,

595
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,680
venting about how her day went,

596
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,098
driving me to a shower.

597
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,141
Of course.

598
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,561
That's the reason
why most people get married.

599
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,816
Together on weekends,
holidays, and vacation.

600
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,528
Together 24/7, every day.
Eating, sleeping, and doing it together.

601
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,741
However hard I think about it, I can't.

602
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:57,867
Stop overreacting.

603
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,704
You're just scared
of picking up the pieces.

604
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:03,498
See, Bo-ra is cool.

605
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,792
She might just let it go
without much trouble.

606
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,836
She might let it go.

607
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,297
"I'm so forgiving, so I forgive you."

608
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,507
"But you're guilty until we die."

609
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,592
"You get to save your neck for now."

610
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,594
"But still, you're a prisoner of war."

611
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,847
"You're not innocent.
You're on probation."

612
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,932
You don't know her.

613
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,311
She can be quite clingy and smothering.

614
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:28,481
When I'm with her, the air feels so thick.

615
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,233
My whole body feels heavy.

616
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:33,737
Like being in a formal social
with my necktie tightly around my neck.

617
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,071
I feel suffocated.

618
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:40,368
This isn't love, is it?

619
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:43,163
How can I possibly marry her?

620
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,708
Don't you know? That is love.

621
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,252
If you don't,
remind yourself by rote like me.

622
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,424
"I love Bo-ra."

623
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:59,095
The moment I got caught,
my inner voice told me,

624
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,098
"Now is the chance. Run."

625
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,897
Looks like Yu-jeong won't get a bag.

626
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,983
Yu-jeong. I did the best I could.

627
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:19,449
Bo-ra.

628
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,497
Yeon Bo-ra.

629
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,257
What are you two doing?

630
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,677
You guys are utterly gross and low.

631
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,138
Jin-woo. I'll see you at home.

632
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,531
Hi, Yu-jeong. It's been a while.

633
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,740
Yeah.

634
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,203
What's wrong?

635
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,229
It's strange,
I can't remember what I heard.

636
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:38,319
He said that he doesn't
want to marry me, right?

637
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,741
That he does not love me,

638
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,038
that his whole body feels heavy,
and what else did he say?

639
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,375
That he feels suffocated.

640
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,508
Let's just leave it at cheating.

641
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,388
I thought nothing could be
worse than that.

642
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:06,556
But that's better.

643
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:08,892
Hey.

644
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:14,272
Yu-jeong, I don't know what to do now.

645
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,400
What should I do?

646
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,200
What should I do?

647
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,588
Let's lie down.

648
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,197
You're here.

649
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,440
You knew, didn't you?

650
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,277
Knew what?

651
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,238
You know what I mean. Ju-wan's cheating.

652
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:50,535
I know men pretend like they don't know,
cover for each other, and act as an alibi.

653
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,830
No, I really didn't know.

654
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,374
That's why I asked him if he did it.

655
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,585
That too.

656
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,878
How can you ask a question like that?

657
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,464
You two don't take cheating seriously?

658
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,384
Did you just not get caught cheating?

659
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:09,762
That's not it.

660
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:14,434
Men just talk with no filter, like joking.

661
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,811
Joking?

662
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,441
"I don't get butterflies anymore."

663
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,027
"Say, 'I love you' by rote."
This kind of joking?

664
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,907
"The sound of my wife
in the shower scares me."

665
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,534
"Can't do it with your family."

666
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:34,537
"It's just loyalty now. I want to
be a wild-goose dad."

667
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:39,167
These kind of married-man jokes
sicken me to the core.

668
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,003
But then my husband makes these jokes.

669
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,760
A couple who has no affection
for each other,

670
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:52,639
and a husband who's not
attracted to his wife.

671
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,475
Is that funny to you?

672
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,934
Is that funny?

673
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,188
Babe.

674
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,524
You know it's not like that.

675
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,153
-Don't be mad...
-I thought you'd be different.

676
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,322
I thought we were different.

677
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,577
I'm not mad.

678
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,121
I'm just sad.

679
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,418
I'm sorry.

680
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:50,798
"I'm sorry."
There's nothing more after that.

681
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:54,886
"I'm sorry" has to be followed
by "It's all my fault."

682
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:59,557
"I will never do it again, please
forgive me, you're my one and only."

683
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:04,020
"I love you."

684
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,920
PLEASE ALWAYS SPEAK TO ME NICELY

685
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:47,772
Bo-ra...

686
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:36,654
Don't turn it off.

687
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,784
You weren't sleeping?

688
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,162
Why? Can't you sleep?

689
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,510
Heinrich's Accident Triangle.

690
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:03,347
One high-severity incident
is always preceded

691
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:07,184
by 29 minor incidents
and 300 near-miss incidents.

692
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:11,355
The moment I got caught,
my inner voice told me,

693
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,692
"Now is the chance. Run."

694
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:19,405
Before my relationship fell apart,
there were certainly the things

695
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,490
that I had missed.

696
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,326
What were those?

697
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,082
A cellphone face down?

698
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,500
I feel terrible.

699
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,461
I need to go back to the office now.

700
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,254
A sudden plan?

701
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:37,798
I'm so sorry.

702
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:40,301
Saying sorry like a habit.

703
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,554
Someone's unfamiliar trace?

704
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,892
Watching the same movie he'd seen.

705
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:50,144
I told you not to call.

706
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:52,772
He became secretive.

707
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:57,443
If I didn't have an early morning meeting,
I would've stayed.

708
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,320
He got busier with work.

709
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:00,988
Are you going to sleep early?

710
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,615
He checked my schedule.

711
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,078
How did I not know?

712
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:23,469
I'm in front of your house. Come out.

713
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,975
I have nothing to say. Go.

714
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:41,278
I'll wait till you come.

715
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:26,991
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

716
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,802
Stop crying.

717
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,356
I'm sorry.

718
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:17,995
For what?

719
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,047
Did you come to tell me that?

720
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:34,970
I still had hopes for him.

721
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:37,890
I'm sorry.

722
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,559
He is still saying, "I'm sorry."

723
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,812
Nothing more after that.

724
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:49,503
Are you okay?
You're drunk, let me walk you home.

725
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,255
I'm not drunk.

726
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,340
I just tripped.

727
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,342
Okay.

728
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,595
If you don't want me around,
I'll call Bo-mi. Wait.

729
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,390
Bo-mi?

730
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,393
You've got some nerve to say that name.

731
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,730
Who do you think you are
to say my sister's name?

732
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,816
All right, at least for Bo-mi's sake,

733
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,569
eat well, stop crying
and take care of yourself.

734
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,112
Stop making her so worried.

735
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:17,573
Like you said, who am I to you?

736
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,241
I'm not worth it, right?

737
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:21,827
You...

738
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,496
Why did you come?

739
01:00:26,582 --> 01:00:29,835
I know I'm not supposed to text you...

740
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,462
but Bo-ra can't sleep.

741
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:41,013
Is that why you came?

742
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:43,891
"I did what I could do."
To clear your conscience?

743
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:51,523
Hey...

744
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:54,860
Do you know what you just did?

745
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,405
You shoved the three years
we spent together into a garbage can.

746
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:01,325
While I dreamed of our future,
you and her...

747
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,410
You know that's not it.

748
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:05,662
Regardless of her, we already...

749
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,581
What about us?

750
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,917
What? We already had problems?

751
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,752
That's why you did it?

752
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:14,713
That's what you want to believe.

753
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,970
Even if someone will die tomorrow,
if you kill him today, it's murder.

754
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:25,808
Even if we had our issues, you're
the one who ended things terribly.

755
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,435
So stop that bullshit!

756
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,116
Sure.

757
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:46,245
I can't say I had no idea at all.

758
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,707
You were becoming cold,
I became more on edge.

759
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,876
I'm aware of that too.

760
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,505
Despite that, I tried harder.

761
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,507
And everything was getting better.

762
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,759
But you ruined everything.

763
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,679
Trying is not love.

764
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,473
Love?

765
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:12,187
Then what you have with her is love?
Are you saying you really love her?

766
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:21,864
This is going nowhere.
Think whatever you want.

767
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:29,037
Okay, good luck
with that great love of yours.

768
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,873
No matter what people say,

769
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,792
you can overcome anything
with the power of love.

770
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,462
Are you blackmailing me?

771
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,255
So this is how low you can go.

772
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:40,632
Why? Are you scared?

773
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:44,136
Right, you're freakishly conscious
of what others think, right?

774
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:48,724
On the surface, you pretend to be
lofty, loving, gentle, laid-back, cool,

775
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:53,270
but under the surface, you're nervous
about how others think of you.

776
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,564
You think people don't know that? They do.

777
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,108
Girls who check you out?

778
01:02:58,192 --> 01:03:01,236
You think they do
because you're strikingly attractive?

779
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,780
Don't kid yourself.
The reasons are obvious.

780
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:05,449
Your background is attractive.

781
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:09,244
They just fell for your bluff. Wake up.

782
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:14,374
So, are you any different from them?

783
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,542
Are you different?

784
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:19,087
You're the one who enjoyed
and took advantage of it.

785
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,548
Who took pictures of every little thing

786
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,884
and posted it on social media
all the time?

787
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,261
That's why you dated me.

788
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,348
-What?
-Didn't you? Then what?

789
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,600
Why do you even want to marry me?

790
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,727
Just be honest.

791
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,897
You want to marry a man
who can feed your vanity.

792
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,775
Stop acting like you're so heartbroken.

793
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,944
Do you know how suffocating you are?

794
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,488
Really? You feel suffocated again?

795
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,991
If you're so suffocated,
then how are you still alive?

796
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,202
Say whatever you want.

797
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,538
But I know you can't.

798
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,832
'Cause all you care about
is how others think of you,

799
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,460
your feelings, and your pride.

800
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:00,921
You're doing this because of your pride.

801
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:04,049
So I'm actually not sorry at all.

802
01:04:05,801 --> 01:04:07,344
Are you done?

803
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,641
Hey, what did I do so horribly wrong?

804
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,060
Does everybody get married after dating?

805
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,771
You always talked about
breaking up when we fought.

806
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,940
Now that I say it, you can't stand it?

807
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,942
You've done nothing wrong?

808
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,528
If you did nothing wrong,
would I have done it?

809
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,280
What turned me into this is you.

810
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,532
You ruined everything!

811
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:32,578
Seriously...

812
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:35,122
We could have ended it nicely.

813
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:39,835
Once you got over it,
we could have become friends again.

814
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:41,837
But what's this?

815
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,256
What are we doing in front of
this pile of garbage?

816
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,342
It's because you're garbage!

817
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:51,888
'Cause you're garbage, you're garbage!
You're stinky, disgusting garbage!

818
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:56,101
Sir, here's more garbage.
Put this garbage away too, please.

819
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:03,275
Okay, I am garbage.

820
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:04,901
I'm a piece of garbage.

821
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,361
The garbage is being loaded.

822
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,572
Let's go!

823
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:09,823
Get down, please.

824
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,116
If I'm garbage,

825
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,452
what does that make you?

826
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:17,039
I said I wanted to end it well.
Is this what you want?

827
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,166
Well?

828
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,543
I am disgusted.

829
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,756
Come on, guys.

830
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,176
That's right, I'm garbage too.

831
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,677
It's 'cause I'm garbage too.

832
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:33,180
Why did I fall for garbage like you?

833
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,766
'Cause I'm garbage myself.

834
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,106
Please get down, miss. You could get hurt.

835
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,524
No, sir...

836
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,486
Right, I'm garbage.

837
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:50,739
You are toxic waste
that can't even be recycled.

838
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:54,451
Toxic waste, okay?

839
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:03,168
We knew each other so well,
maybe better than ourselves.

840
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:08,340
That doesn't necessarily mean
that we understood each other well.

841
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:10,676
We just knew each other so well

842
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:13,679
that we could hit each other
where it hurts the most,

843
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,098
to strike a fatal blow.

844
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:20,143
Before we knew it,
we ended up covered in blood.

845
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,729
Come on. Please!

846
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:26,274
Start the truck, please!

847
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,694
You could get hurt, miss. Please get down.

848
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,450
Let's go!

849
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:36,743
Let's go.

850
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,131
What's all this?

851
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,725
My love that I thought was strong
and more perfect than anybody else's

852
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:00,976
was all over...

853
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:14,072
in such a messy, low,
ugly, wretched, and pathetic manner.

854
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,199
After lashing out and hitting rock bottom,

855
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:20,370
all that's left was the bare minimum
of his duty to pat me on the back

856
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,997
while I barf.

857
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,940
TRUE TO LOVE

858
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:52,235
Get it together.
In this cold, harsh world,

859
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,196
no one is on your side!

860
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,116
She told me to send a contract.
She's unreachable.

861
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,534
Can't get a hold of her?

862
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,703
It's been a while
I felt challenged like this.

863
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:02,788
Let's go.

864
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,456
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

865
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,541
It's an important event. Do well.

866
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,960
Please welcome to the stage
dating coach, Deborah.

867
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:12,339
Welcome to Golden Night,
ladies and gentlemen.

868
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,049
The person you're calling...

869
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,468
I heard you got proposed to. Congrats.

870
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,471
Deborah says!

871
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:23,517
Men are bastards!

872
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,437
I will get even with you!

873
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:30,816
Don't follow me.
