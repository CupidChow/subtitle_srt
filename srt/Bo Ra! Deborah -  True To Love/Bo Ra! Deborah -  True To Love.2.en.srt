00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,004
TRUE TO LOVE

00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,585
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,839
He has a ring in his pocket...

5
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:47,965
Yu-ri.

6
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:51,343
...and I'm ready to say yes.

7
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,807
Our happy ending was approaching.

00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,900
EP 02
SAD ENDING

9
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,914
-Is it here?
-Yes.

10
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,374
I made a reservation.
I wanted to bring you here.

11
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,793
Aren't I the best?

12
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:27,254
You are! I get to enjoy great food
thanks to my cutie pie.

13
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,592
Hang on.

14
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,178
Good evening.

15
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,304
Hello.

16
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,681
Let me show you to your table,
once confirmed.

17
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,100
May I ask under what name
is your reservation?

18
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,811
Excuse me?

19
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,063
Under what name is your reservation, sir?

20
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,565
Well, that's...

21
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,027
Under what name?

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,323
Cutie pie?

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,244
Doll face?

24
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,253
Babe?

25
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,922
Not on the list?

26
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,340
No, sir.

27
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,029
Hello.

28
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,283
What? The final decision has been made?

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,165
I can't believe what I just heard.

30
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,794
So you voluntarily went to the mall
and bought this?

31
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,713
Still, Yu-ri dumped you?

32
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,590
That's why you're in a crappy mood?

33
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:57,011
Oh, boy!

34
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,933
What should I do now?

35
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,187
This is why I don't have a love life.

36
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,773
I'm so proud of myself.

37
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,275
I'm doing such a great job.

38
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,359
You sure about that?

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,321
What do you do every evening?

40
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,240
What I do is dating.
I don't commit in a relationship.

41
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,454
Took her to dinner when she wanted,
kept her company on a rough day,

42
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,372
spent birthdays, Christmas together.

43
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,249
I didn't see anyone else.

44
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,627
I always gave her updates when she asked.

45
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,049
What kind of lunatic would do that
for a woman he doesn't like?

46
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,383
Do I need to say it?

47
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:41,347
How else would she know?
"I won't let you have a day of hardship."

48
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,723
"I'll love you forever."

49
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,600
You say these things for a reason.

50
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,101
Paying lip service,

51
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,687
and pretending to believe it,
that's dating.

52
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,024
I love you.

53
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,361
It's not a big deal.
I'd say it tirelessly.

54
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:57,821
Celebrities say it even to random people.

55
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:01,200
Fair enough,
if it's hard to say, "I love you,"

56
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,535
just say, "I love you" in English.

57
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,872
Just make sure not to say,
"Let's get married."

58
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:08,707
That's one thing you're doing well.

59
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:15,589
By the way, Yu-ri was so resolute.

60
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:19,009
It's not easy for a woman
to turn away from this ring.

61
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,552
And this mint color.

62
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,596
Just the sight of this mint color

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,890
raises women's heart rates
by 22% they say.

64
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,101
That's science.

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,480
I couldn't even take it out.

66
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,193
You should've taken it out,
it's a game-changer.

67
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,903
You idiot.

68
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,072
She said dating me was always hard.

69
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,575
What does that make me?
What about me who bought a ring?

70
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,287
A few days ago,
she was totally fine, then suddenly...

71
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:51,667
She's literally toying with my heart.

72
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,754
Whatever, if she saw this,
it would've been different.

73
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,341
You should've taken it out,
saying, "I love you."

74
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,176
"Marry me, not anybody else."

75
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,761
"You're the only one for me."

76
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:06,390
"Give me just one chance."
But you didn't, you idiot.

77
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,188
Deborah.

78
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,066
What about Deborah?

79
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,152
It's all her fault.

80
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,194
What?

81
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:22,489
I won't work with Deborah.

82
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,158
Where's this coming from?

83
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,869
You said okay,
so I scheduled a meeting already.

84
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,371
I'm out! Deborah? Or whatever her name is!

85
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,124
I've been trying very hard
to be patient with you.

86
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,752
Now you're being a handful
'cause you got dumped.

87
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,005
Why all of a sudden? Why?

88
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,674
You failed,
so you want all couples to go to hell?

89
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,634
Do all romances sound like bullshit?

90
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,595
You're the vice president.

91
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,722
Why are you so selfish?

92
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,599
Right, I'm selfish.

93
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,642
Yu-ri said that too.

94
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,187
I'm a mean, cowardly, and selfish jerk.

95
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,982
That's why I'm out. I'm absolutely out.

96
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,193
Hey, you don't have to leave. Wait!

97
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,279
Are you drunk? Hey!

98
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,198
Hey...

99
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,618
Ramyeon is ready.

100
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,579
You worked late yesterday.
Are you working today too?

101
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,206
Let's eat.

102
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,582
My balcony?

103
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,292
Okay.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,095
What's all this?

105
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,598
What's with her?

106
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,890
Babe.

107
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,518
I love you.

108
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,523
Marry me. Let's spend
the rest of our lives together.

109
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,240
Jin-woo.

110
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,120
So... Why exactly
didn't you propose to me?

111
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,164
So out of the blue.

112
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,374
Didn't I?

113
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,750
Did you?

114
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,129
Didn't I ask you to marry me?

115
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,423
Then how did we get married?

116
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,508
How would I know?

117
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,472
Right, you asked me to marry you.

118
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,640
Exactly.

119
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,602
Why did you not pop the question first?

120
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,769
Why?

121
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,521
I don't know.

122
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,276
Back then, I didn't really think
about getting married at all.

123
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,281
Then why did you say "yes"
when I asked you?

124
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,451
I don't know. Just...

125
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,039
You know I say "yes" to everything.

126
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,503
I see.

127
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,507
That's how we got married.

128
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,803
Four years of marriage,
and I didn't know until now.

129
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,268
Did I do something wrong again?

130
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:40,520
You're really asking?

131
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,832
He bought a ring.

132
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,169
Ju-wan bought a ring and left.

133
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,098
JU-WAN

134
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,064
Hello.

135
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:24,982
Are you up?

136
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:31,029
Yes, I woke up early this morning.

137
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,864
You have a broadcast today, right?

138
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:33,991
Yes.

139
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,493
Shall we go out after that?

140
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,871
Today?

141
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,291
Why all of a sudden?

142
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,627
Well, I just want to see you
all of a sudden.

143
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:52,092
I wonder why you want to see me
all of a sudden.

144
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,010
See you later.

145
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,681
Okay, see you later.

146
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,683
Bye.

147
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,052
Yeon Bo-mi.

148
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,429
You took my dress. Where is it?

149
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,349
What dress?

150
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,144
"What dress?" The dress you stole from me.

151
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,438
How dare you? It still had a tag on it.

152
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,982
Come on, I didn't.

153
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,235
I'll kill you.
Where is it? Give it to me already.

154
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,948
I have no idea.
Look for it again, carefully.

155
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,576
I can't find it anywhere.

156
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,869
You really don't know?

157
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,497
With buttons like this.

158
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,457
It looks like this, it's girly.

159
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,334
The purple sweater dress.

160
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,921
That one?

161
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,383
I did wear it once.

162
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,178
But the thing is...

163
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,682
Goodness.

164
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,897
Oh, my goodness. Bo-mi!

165
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,860
There was something on it.
After washing it, it turned out like this.

166
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,404
Maybe it's the fabric.

167
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,324
You're not supposed to wash it.
You should've dry cleaned it.

168
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,867
Know how much this cost?

169
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,329
How could I know? Stop with the yelling.

170
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,124
How could you know?

171
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,543
I'm already upset
that you stole my clothes.

172
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,048
Are you insane?

173
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,426
Why the hell are you yelling?

174
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,593
Seriously?

175
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,514
Watch your language,
I'm your older sister.

176
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,057
Why the hell?

177
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,892
Are you going to hit me?

178
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,061
Hit me!

179
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,022
You've gone crazy. Are you a nut job?

180
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,399
Yes, I'm a nut job.

181
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,110
Is sharing clothes a big deal?

182
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,112
You're a cheapskate, aren't you?

183
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,449
Cheapskate? Are you going to
talk to me like that?

184
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,327
It's a big day for me.

185
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,164
Is that all you have?
You can wear something else.

186
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,624
That color doesn't
complement your skin anyway.

187
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,836
Look. It doesn't suit your skin tone.

188
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,176
Which one then?

189
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,386
The two-piece suit
you bought at the outlet.

190
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,724
Or that one, the pink tweed dress
you got earlier this year.

191
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,767
The one you looked classy and pretty in.

192
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,478
You have that one too!

193
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,230
Which one?

194
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,358
The one we bought together in the mall.

195
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,819
Which one is it?

196
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,865
So beautiful.

197
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,283
Really?

198
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,367
Look.

199
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:09,456
This looks so much better.
It goes well with your skin tone.

200
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,374
-That's true.
-It's way better.

201
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,461
Here, look. What about my hair?

202
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,129
Wear it down, or ponytail?

203
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,339
Is this better,

204
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:18,965
or is this better?

205
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,511
Wear it down, sweep it to the side.

206
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,012
-To this side?
-Yes.

207
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,723
-Is this okay?
-Okay.

208
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,350
What about shoes?

209
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,361
-Hello, Mr. Han.
-Good morning.

210
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:40,445
Good morning.

211
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,738
-Hello.
-Hello.

212
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,951
Su-hyeok might be late today.
He has a meeting outside.

213
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,869
He's here.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,083
Okay.

215
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,262
I was worried, but you seem fine.

216
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,893
Last night was horrible because of you.

217
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,812
Why? What did I do?

218
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,522
You don't remember?

219
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,941
You blacked out.

220
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,236
I do remember.

221
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,824
-Sang-jin...
-I know how you feel.

222
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,993
I love you!

223
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,203
How is it easy saying that?

224
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,538
Do you know what love is?

225
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,543
How can love change?

226
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,669
How can love...

227
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,505
change?

228
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,469
What's the point of remembering it?
If you're fine, it's fine, right?

229
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,015
Of course, I'm fine. No biggie.

230
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:15,749
Excuse me, this is our office.
You're not allowed to eat here.

231
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,292
Okay.

232
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,886
What we have here
is the book cover design.

233
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,096
It has a modern vibe in various textures.

234
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,934
As for color, black
and off-white can be 30:70.

235
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,980
If you prefer something darker,
a 70:30 ratio...

236
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:45,904
is a good mix to create a modern style.

237
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,200
You're listening to Date at Noon.

238
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,662
Make sure to stay tuned.

239
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,913
Hi.

240
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,456
You're here.

241
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,917
It's the hottest segment.

242
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,960
Dating coach...

243
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,462
Why isn't Yu-ri here?

244
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,714
She called in sick
because of a nasty cold.

245
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,216
Oh, dear.

246
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,218
-Here's your script.
-Okay.

247
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,054
And about the broadcast yesterday.

248
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,140
I know. I got carried away yesterday.

249
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,226
Okay, I'll take it down a notch.

250
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,064
Nonsense. You did amazing,
I'm saying I loved it.

251
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,316
Remember our concept?

252
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,527
Deborah who crosses the line.

253
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,113
Spicy mala flavor,
overpowering spicy flavor.

254
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,823
-Deborah says!
-Deborah says!

255
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,828
The listeners' response was terrific.

256
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,247
Yeah, why do you think
Deborah is so popular?

257
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,416
Brutally honest,
refreshingly blunt character.

258
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,084
Stay in character.

259
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:46,005
What's this suspicious
and awkward flattery?

260
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,218
The thing is, the radio rating survey
starts this week.

261
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,262
Let's try to win

262
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,514
at least on the days you come out.

263
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:57,600
We hand-picked hardcore stories.
You know the drill.

264
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,572
I love him against all odds.
I said, "Let's work on us,"

265
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,533
but he just sighed,
saying, "I'm so sick of this."

266
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,411
"Should I let him go and break up?

267
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,288
"Can't I work on it more?

268
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,540
"Is there no hope at all?"

269
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,000
Deborah says!

270
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,127
The law of conservation of mass.

271
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,796
If his share is 0,
you have to shoulder 100.

272
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,214
All by yourself.

273
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,383
You want to be a slave? Or a servant?

274
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,887
Do you need to stay in this
miserable relationship?

275
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,305
Break up with him.

276
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,391
The girl who can't break up

277
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,727
The boy who can't break away

278
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,897
"I completely trusted him.
But that night, I saw him...

279
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,902
cheating on me with my best friend."

280
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,446
"At first, I was going to break up."

281
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,617
"But he begged for forgiveness,
saying, 'It was one-time mistake.'"

282
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,037
"Other than that,
he's quite a decent man."

283
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,330
"Should I break up?"

284
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,082
"If I forgive him just once,

285
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,878
wouldn't he love me again like before

286
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,507
and become the boyfriend
who loved me dearly?"

287
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,554
The man is decent
all though he's a cheater.

288
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,182
This saint-like woman forgives him...

289
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,896
You want me to give you a spoiler?
You want a spoiler for the next part?

290
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,773
Please do.

291
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:30,735
She'd get more suspicious and obsessive.

292
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,447
He'd take anything at first,
then get tired and cheat again.

293
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,908
One day, she gets a call.

294
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,867
-Hello?
-Hello?

295
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,370
-Who is this?
-His girlfriend. Who are you?

296
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,287
I'm his girlfriend.

297
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,539
We've dated two years.

298
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,748
We've dated three years.

299
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,083
He was with me that day.

300
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,584
He asked me to marry him.

301
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,419
He said he'd broken up with you.

302
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,213
He said you were crazy.

303
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,508
In this case, you think
he'll beg for forgiveness?

304
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,592
Nope.

305
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
He's not even sorry anymore.

306
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,887
Why?

307
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:01,057
"'Cause you made me lonely."
"'Cause you didn't trust me."

308
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,017
"'Cause you suffocated me."

309
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,104
There are all
too many reasons for cheating.

310
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,316
Then you meet the other girl,
grab her hair,

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,778
pour water or juice over her,
and break up.

312
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,072
Then you get all clingy and obsessive.

313
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:20,451
You swear and yell at him,
slam the car door, throw your phone.

314
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:25,123
Does it make sense? Really?
Do you really want this crappy romance?

315
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,958
Come on. Don't you think so?

316
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,460
What more reason do you need to break up?

317
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,837
I don't know.

318
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,422
Deborah says!

319
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,968
Cheating is a completely
decent reason to break up.

320
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,680
Awesome.

321
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,814
We'll be back
after hearing "Crazy Guy" by #Gun.

322
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,274
Stick around till part four.

323
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,235
This concludes
Almost Everything About Love

324
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,738
with Deborah.

325
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,741
Bye, everyone.

326
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,242
Bye.

327
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,581
Good job, Bo-ra.

328
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,001
It's beautiful outside,
how about a beer? My treat.

329
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,210
Of course.

330
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,462
Not me.

331
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,547
You can tell from this dress.

332
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,549
You say, "Break up," to everyone.

333
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,718
But your life is all rosy, huh?

334
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:24,390
Sorry. I'll treat you next time.
Please clean this up for me, bye.

335
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,559
Today's show was great. What do you think?

336
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,104
So refreshed.

337
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,816
Bo-ra.

338
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,361
Hop in.

339
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,615
I have no clue, I have no clue.

340
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,997
Good job today.

341
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,510
Is the trunk door open?

342
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,513
Can you check the door, babe?

343
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,557
Okay.

344
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,893
Sure thing.

345
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,526
So cheesy.

346
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,571
When I open it, the trunk
will be filled with flowers,

347
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,200
balloons, and a banner
that says, "Marry me."

348
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,249
Bo-ra.

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,018
It's a cliché, but cute.

350
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,079
Is it just us here?

351
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:10,997
Let's go.

352
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,168
Screening a proposal video?

353
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,713
I don't care for cheesy stuff.

354
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,922
Dummy.

355
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,822
TERRIBLY BORING LOVE

356
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:45,782
CREDITS

357
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:58,920
So fun.

358
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,134
The movie was no fun at all.

359
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,098
The person I admired the most
was the honorable An Jung-geun.

360
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,894
My childhood dream was to be like him.

361
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,732
Hold on, Bo-ra.

362
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,694
What is he doing?

363
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:26,405
Proposing in front of this statue?

364
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,159
It's too sacred.

365
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,668
Restroom is there. Let's go.

366
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:54,058
Okay. Okay, I see.

367
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,204
If I didn't have an early morning meeting,
I would've stayed.

368
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,542
No worries, I have
an important meeting tomorrow too.

369
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,836
-Bye.
-Are you going to sleep early?

370
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,797
At the usual time, I guess. Why?

371
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,883
Never mind. I'll call you later.

372
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,594
Bye.

373
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,096
Bo-ra.

374
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,394
He waited till I let my guard down.

375
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,313
That was it.

376
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,667
I'm back.

377
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,127
-You're back?
-Yeah.

378
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,842
Seriously...

379
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,309
My feet are killing me.

380
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,412
Hey, your phone.

381
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,580
Who is it?

382
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,001
Seriously...

383
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,922
"Don't pick up."

384
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:49,882
Don't pick it up! No.

385
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,842
No.

386
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,095
Something is fishy.

387
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:58,349
What?

388
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,018
For my cell phone bill.
Or they'll cut service.

389
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,187
So? You have my credit card.

390
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:06,649
You lowered the limit,
so it maxed out already.

391
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,735
Really? Why didn't I get a text?

392
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:15,700
I actually blocked it.
It'd only upset you, don't you think?

393
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,833
Yeon Bo-mi.

394
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,297
Go see how other kids of your age live.

395
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,384
They study, work multiple part-time jobs
to pay back their student loans.

396
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:37,763
You know how hard they work?
You're so hopelessly irresponsible.

397
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,057
How can you be so immature?

398
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,270
What will you do once I get married?

399
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:48,190
Why does that matter?
So when do you get married?

400
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,984
You're getting ahead of yourself.

401
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,570
Forget it.

402
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:53,904
I'm going to tell Mom.

403
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,656
Wait, stay right there.

404
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,659
Leave the credit card.

405
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,870
Get an allowance from me when needed.

406
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,663
You can't keep doing this.

407
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,711
Here you are. Give me the card.

408
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,843
Come back before the last bus leaves.

409
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,306
I'll stay up and see when you come back.

410
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,642
She ignored me. I'll kill you!

411
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,803
Sweet ride.

412
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,431
-Sergeant!
-Hey.

413
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:03,891
Hey, keep it down.

414
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,268
Lower your arm, seriously.

415
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,395
Wake up.

416
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,105
-This ain't the army.
-Right.

417
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,149
Now that everyone is here,

418
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,652
let's go.

419
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,288
You know the biggest turn-off for girls?

420
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,874
Army talk, soccer talk.
Soccer-in-the-army talk.

421
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:32,253
Don't embarrass yourself
rambling off your army stories.

422
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:36,340
Say some smooth pick-up lines
with confidence.

423
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,134
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

424
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,151
Comrades. I wish you luck.

425
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,029
See you again. Charge forward!

426
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,223
It's boring here, right?

427
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,433
It's fun.

428
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,851
I didn't hear you well.

429
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,396
I said it is fun!

430
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,564
Same here.

431
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,985
What is your MBTI?

432
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,447
Isn't your MBTI C-U-T-E?

433
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,125
Didn't it hurt? When you fell from heaven.

434
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,627
What?

435
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,796
Heaven, because you're an angel.

436
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,465
It must have hurt
when you fell from heaven.

437
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:26,218
International student?

438
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:27,720
I didn't hear you well.

439
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,513
Are you an international student?

440
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,057
Can't you speak Korean?

441
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:37,646
Bo-mi, what are you doing? Let's go.

442
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,484
Hold on.

443
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,741
Can I get your phone number?

444
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,662
Do you believe in destiny?

445
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,315
It's just that...

446
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,984
I was afraid you entered the wrong number.

447
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,153
It could happen. I'm hanging up.

448
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,280
Take care.

449
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,787
International student, my foot.

450
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,247
He's obviously a soldier who's on leave.

451
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,749
I could tell from his hair.

452
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,876
Didn't you see the tan mark up here?

453
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,461
What about it?

454
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,547
That's right where
military uniform sleeves roll up to.

455
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,050
Why did you give him your number?

456
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,302
Don't tell me you're interested.

457
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:55,057
I don't know. He seemed kind of nice.

458
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,227
It's him. Let's go.

459
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:00,396
-Who?
-Sang-hyeok is here.

460
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,816
I don't want to go.
Why did you give him my number?

461
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,112
How refreshing!

462
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,753
Oh, my.

463
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,089
You want some water too?

464
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:33,137
Pretty. You are absolutely glowing.

465
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,682
Are you going to sleep early?

466
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,102
Never mind. I'll call you later.

467
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,105
Hold on.

468
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,150
Is he going to come over later?

469
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:50,112
I shouldn't have removed my makeup.

470
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,531
PLEASE ALWAYS SPEAK TO ME NICELY

471
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,666
-Long time no see.
-Join.

472
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,168
Hurry, have a seat.

473
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,504
-Bo-mi.
-I want some too.

474
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,549
I want some too.

475
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,926
Drink.

476
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,555
Let's all cheers.

477
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,765
Bottoms up.

478
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,349
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up!

479
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:20,601
Bottoms up.

480
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,479
Bottoms up!

481
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,564
Let's play a game.

482
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,191
Let's play a game.

483
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,155
I'm taking off. Have fun.

484
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,285
Bo-mi, wait.

485
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,831
Let me give you a ride.

486
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,875
-No, thanks. I'll go,
-The thing is,

487
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,007
I stopped drinking,
'cause I heard you did.

488
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,220
Let me just give you a ride.

489
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,514
I won't call you again.

490
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,521
Hello? Sergeant Lee.

491
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,565
I took off already.

492
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,109
I'll get going. Take care.
Division White Skull!

493
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:14,947
Four o'clock...

494
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,833
Bo-mi. Bo-mi!

495
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,627
What's the matter?

496
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,212
What do you think you're doing?

497
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,673
I'll give you a ride home
once I get sober.

498
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,133
What do you mean?
You said you stopped drinking.

499
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,387
I wasn't serious.

500
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,931
You saw me drinking earlier.

501
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,892
You knew it all.
Enough of playing hard-to-get.

502
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:44,810
What?

503
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,397
You're the one who's ridiculous.

504
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,150
You let me buy you drinks.
You took advantage of me too.

505
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,944
I let you buy me drinks?

506
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:57,364
You think I didn't know you guys
were just trying to get me drunk?

507
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,992
Whatever.

508
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,035
Decide, so I can cancel the room.

509
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,579
You should've told me sooner.

510
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,872
Hey.

511
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,458
It's for the drinks tonight. My treat.

512
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,210
Sleeping with me? In your dreams.

513
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:13,839
If I need to, I'll pay a fortune
just to avoid sleeping with you.

514
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,468
Hey, stop right there.

515
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,056
-Stop or else!
-Or else what?

516
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,904
Or else what?

517
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,356
I think we're really meant to be.

518
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,691
I'm warning you,
don't even think about it.

519
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,068
I'm in a very bad mood.

520
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,468
For two, please.

521
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,928
Please scan your card.

522
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,763
Paid for multiple passengers.

523
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,957
Four o-clock in the morning.

524
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,419
What's this time of the day like to you?

525
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:20,882
The streets are covered
with a blanket of bluish air,

526
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,177
and the air feels quite
chilly and crisp when you exhale.

527
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:28,765
For most people, it's late in the night

528
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:31,059
when they are fast asleep,

529
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:35,772
but for a writer,
it's probably fuzzy and dream-like

530
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,399
with early morning sentiments.

531
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,820
For a nurse who works in three shifts,

532
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,073
it's time to head home,
dragging their weary bones

533
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,909
after their shift
that started late at night.

534
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,704
I'll kill you if you follow me.

535
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,417
Hey.

536
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:39,544
Are you insane? You know what time it is?

537
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,714
What? What did I do? Seriously!

538
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,467
What's wrong?

539
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,010
Why'd you buy such small heels?

540
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,054
My feet are killing me.

541
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,598
-My heels...
-Whatever! It's all your fault.

542
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,604
Why are you crying? Let me see your feet.

543
00:39:58,522 --> 00:39:59,898
It hurts.

544
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:05,779
What is Deborah's fault?

545
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:08,490
I made it clear.
I'm not working with Deborah.

546
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,450
Wasn't that drunk talk?

547
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:11,535
No.

548
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,078
I'm out. Completely.

549
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,872
What do I do?
She must be on her way here now.

550
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,834
That's not my problem.
You should figure it out.

551
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,794
Wait, Su-hyeok.

552
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,962
Su-hyeok.

553
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,006
It's me.

554
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,681
What? Trash?
He gave you trash, not a ring?

555
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,061
He's quite adorable.

556
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,981
I wonder why he's not giving you the ring.

557
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:45,318
He's gripping his bat too tight,
'cause he wants to hit a big home run.

558
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,280
Sounds somewhat sexy.

559
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,158
A man who grips his bat tight.

560
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,955
Relax, it's just dirty talk,
At my age, it's normal.

561
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,584
Hey, he probably feels pressure.

562
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,752
His girlfriend is a dating coach.

563
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,255
How can he possibly propose properly?

564
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:09,509
Now, I think even if he sends it
through mail, I'd still be touched.

565
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:17,517
I will just be present at the meeting,
because I gave you my word.

566
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:19,477
But, that's as far as it goes.

567
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:23,148
Hey, don't be so closed-minded
from the get-go.

568
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,525
The contract itself
is hard enough to land.

569
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,944
Remember, we're the contractor.

570
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,283
You're right. She can reject our offer.

571
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,784
Deborah is the client.

572
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,078
If she says no, it can't be helped, right?

573
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:41,958
What are you talking about...

574
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,169
Are you trying to purposely...

575
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,546
Come on.

576
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,300
This place is pretty new,
but they published best-sellers already.

577
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:52,427
They're quite hot in this field.

578
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,347
Especially one of their publishers,
Lee Su-hyeok.

579
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,057
-Have you heard of him?
-No.

580
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,267
I worked with him
for the magazine company.

581
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,395
He's got insight.
He's edgy and stylish too.

582
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,023
Anyway, I bet you guys will hit it off.

583
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,317
If you say so.

584
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:09,736
This way.

585
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:15,992
And Mr. Han said that
Su-hyeok is a huge fan of yours.

586
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,161
Really? I'm surprised.

587
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,413
I guess the few male fans
I have are all here.

588
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,750
By the way, how do you
know the president so well?

589
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,294
Because he's my ex...

590
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,090
Hey, you dated him?

591
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,592
No, ex-brother-in-law.

592
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,971
Brother-in-law? You don't have a sister.

593
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,849
Then is his ex-wife...

594
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,434
Right.

595
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,103
No way.

596
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,900
-How may I help you?
-We have a meeting with Mr. Han.

597
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:49,901
It's this way.

598
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:51,486
-Thank you.
-Sure.

599
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,239
Get famous.

600
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,617
Then even if you crap your pants,
the world will applaud you.

601
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,202
Deborah?

602
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:03,957
She's famous,
but everything she says is crap.

603
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,670
Except being a famous dating coach,
she has no substance.

604
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:11,047
Except for social media followers,
what else?

605
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:14,217
Being famous is an amazing thing.

606
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,012
Among the 20 best sellers in essays,

607
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,639
15 of them started from social media.

608
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:23,268
In the social media era,
publishers can't ignore SNS.

609
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,894
Who said that in the meeting?

610
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,062
Was that me?

611
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,607
Become more famous through fame.

612
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,568
Become more successful through success.

613
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:32,944
Don't you know this field?

614
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,822
What's the issue here? Seriously!

615
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:41,536
Love is not a game,
yet she defines a winner and loser.

616
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,204
She's like a cult leader.

617
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,373
There's no answer in the first place.

618
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,667
Yet she provokes people,
talking a good game.

619
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:48,835
It's more like fraud.

620
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,048
Look.

621
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,301
How come she looks different
in each photo?

622
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,969
This is called fraud.

623
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,805
Does she really
look like a beautiful actress?

624
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:02,307
Does this make sense?

625
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:15,320
It was real hard to decide
when to come in.

626
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,572
I was afraid what more I'm going to hear,

627
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,157
so I just let myself in.

628
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,454
You might come back to
get a refund tomorrow.

629
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,499
When wrapping,
don't tie the ribbon tightly.

630
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,708
Gently.

631
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:32,212
A woman who talks crap,
provokes people and is a cult leader.

632
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,714
Oh, and fraud.

633
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:36,174
What's next?

634
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,306
I know I'm photogenic.

635
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,352
I'm Deborah.

636
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:54,692
I'm Lee Su-hyeok.

637
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,155
The ring, right?

638
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,495
Hold on.

639
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,706
Welcome.

640
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,751
I'm Han Sang-jin of Jinlee Publishing.

641
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:18,174
Sang-jin and Lee Su-hyeok.

642
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:21,136
Our names combined, Jinlee Publishing.

643
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,557
That's a very classical naming method.

644
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,643
Well, yes.

645
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,563
Please have a seat.

646
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,398
Sure.

647
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:38,194
Please sit here.

648
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:53,418
By the way, we've met before.

649
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,254
I guess you don't remember me.

650
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:58,548
Pardon me?

651
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,800
Don't you remember me?

652
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,434
Where did we meet?

653
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:14,939
Turns out I went to your wedding.

654
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,734
We took pictures together as well.

655
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,947
Oh, right.

656
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,116
I see.

657
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,751
Who doesn't know that people
retouch photos these days?

658
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,461
You're quite naive.

659
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,005
"The photos may differ from reality."

660
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,424
I should've added that line on the cover.

661
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,969
It's not your worst idea.

662
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,472
Rude.

663
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,641
I'm sorry about the other day.

664
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:51,476
I didn't know you're a dating doctor.

665
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,353
Pardon?

666
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,313
Don't you have a doctorate in romance?

667
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,526
Or should I just call you
a know-it-all in romance?

668
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:06,824
You're rude.

669
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,701
-Am I?
-Aren't you?

670
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:11,162
You're answering a question
with a question.

671
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,497
-Am I?
-Aren't you?

672
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:20,088
Yu-jeong, you became so stunning
beyond recognition.

673
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,300
Don't say that to a woman
who's not a natural beauty.

674
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,886
Just say I look stunning, please.

675
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,972
That was insensitive.

676
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,975
Okay, you always looked stunning.

677
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:34,602
If your profession is a dating coach,

678
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:38,189
you're supposed to be extraordinary
in attracting the opposite sex.

679
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,067
Okay, so?

680
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:45,238
In my opinion,
you don't really have that quality...

681
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:54,414
So you mean, to put it bluntly,

682
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,834
you don't think I'm attractive
or appealing. Is that it?

683
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,003
Well, if you have to put it bluntly.

684
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:06,009
I'm a dating coach, not a player.

685
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,095
Does a soccer coach play on the field?

686
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,265
He wouldn't, though he can,
unless it's for educational purposes.

687
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,310
So it's possible with purposes?

688
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:21,899
Are you asking me to seduce you now?

689
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:23,818
Would it ever be possible?

690
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:27,363
What's the title of Lee Hyori's song?

691
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,615
It's "10 Minutes", right?

692
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:30,783
Not "24 Hours Isn't Enough"?

693
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:35,121
Or "Even After a Decade"?
Or was it 500 years?

694
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,461
Even with the data accumulated
for years as a dating coach,

695
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,671
it takes sufficient experience
in real life

696
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,840
to have profound insights about romances.

697
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,426
The winning percentage is more important.

698
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,637
What was Go player
Lee Se-dol's percentage?

699
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,847
I think mine is higher than his.

700
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,350
Lee Se-dol who beat AlphaGo?

701
00:48:56,684 --> 00:49:00,355
Once again,
there are no winners or losers in love.

702
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,273
Winning percentage doesn't matter.

703
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,483
Yes, there are.

704
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:07,820
Bluntly speaking,
the winner dumps and the loser is dumped.

705
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,671
That's enough.
You're making me feel nauseous.

706
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:29,092
Lucky you. You can skip dinner
and lose weight. Congrats.

707
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,094
Okay.

708
00:49:31,928 --> 00:49:37,141
I think things are getting a bit heated.

709
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,228
Why don't we go get something to drink

710
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:43,314
to take it easy
and cool down a little bit?

711
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,983
Let me cut to the chase.

712
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,653
A lot of people want to do it with me.

713
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,446
Don't you want to do it with me?

714
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,699
"Do you want to do it with me or not?"

715
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,952
Not clarifying what "it" is
can cause a misunderstanding.

716
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:56,994
How about you?

717
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,706
You want to do it with me?

718
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,213
Yes, suddenly I really do.

719
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:10,341
While we're at it,
shall we do it properly?

720
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:12,927
Can I send you the contract now?

721
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,680
You can look forward to my reply.

722
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:22,061
Vice President Lee might look prickly,

723
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,063
but once you work with him,

724
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:28,025
you'd think, "I'm glad
I'm working with him. He's good."

725
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,736
"I want to do it again."

726
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,988
Be clear about what you mean by "it."

727
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,742
You know what I mean. Do a project!

728
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:39,328
She understood already,
why are you making it awkward?

729
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,248
It's like how the owners
of popular restaurants are prickly.

730
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,667
"Don't need you. I have lots of buyers"

731
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:47,295
But I don't care.

732
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,715
As long as I'm satisfied, it's fine.

733
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,760
You just crossed the line, no?

734
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:55,511
Did I?

735
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:56,554
Did you not?

736
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:01,976
Let's wrap it up
and continue this somewhere else.

737
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,521
Let's do that. At this rate,
somebody is going to pass out.

738
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,065
Mr. Han, I think the meeting
made you age a bit.

739
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,819
I know, right? You know me so well.

740
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:16,073
Let's get going.
I'll treat you all nicely.

741
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:16,991
Okay.

742
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,576
Let's go.

743
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:22,038
Let's go, okay? Let's go.

744
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,082
What's with him?

745
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,879
Let's go already.

746
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,964
-Let go.
-Come on.

747
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:36,552
I didn't expect to mention the contract
in the first meeting.

748
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,805
If this was your big picture all along,

749
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:42,183
I'll apologize.
But if you mess up more than this,

750
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,311
you and I are done, okay?

751
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,313
Answer me already.

752
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,690
There's nothing more I can mess up.

753
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,609
Where are you going? Come on.

754
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,867
What's with him? Am I the contractor here?

755
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:03,037
They're the ones that wanted a meeting.
What's all this?

756
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:04,872
Did I do something wrong?

757
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,582
Is that how he is?

758
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:10,044
Or is it just a front? Trying to look like
a prickly publisher.

759
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,712
He isn't usually like that.

760
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,881
I'm flustered too. What's gotten into him?

761
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,883
But why did you say you'll do it?

762
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,718
I thought you'd just storm out.

763
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,971
I don't know. I'm pissed off.

764
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,348
I felt like I would lose if I stormed out.

765
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,891
I'm so screwed.

766
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:26,435
I don't know, seriously.

767
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:32,567
Let me fill your glass.

768
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,403
Here.

769
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,238
Let's remember...

770
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,490
-These members!
-These members!

771
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,962
May I get your number?

772
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,306
-I got it.
-Okay.

773
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,000
Press the call button.

774
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,336
Okay.

775
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,133
Got it.

776
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,055
Hang up.

777
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,515
Should I pick up the phone?

778
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:56,943
-I'll create a group chat and invite you.
-Sounds good.

779
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,153
Let's feel free to communicate there.

780
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,405
"Feel free," I like it.

781
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,034
"BAD GIRL GOOD GIRL"
SONG BY: MISS A

782
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,622
Bo-ra!

783
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:02,466
You don't know me!

784
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,928
You don't know me!

785
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,931
So shut off boy

786
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:13,060
So shut off boy, so shut off, shut off!

787
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:17,148
You can't say a word to my face

788
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:20,651
But boy you got some nerves
To talk behind my back

789
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,780
Are you kidding me?

790
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:31,037
Hello, hello, hello
You've never met

791
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:35,041
A girl like me

792
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,293
But who are you to judge me?

793
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,880
Are you scared of me?

794
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,384
Is this the famous
sing-like-you-are-talking technique?

795
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,970
Feels like it's directed at me.

796
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:51,182
It's not directed at you.
It's directed at me.

797
00:55:51,724 --> 00:55:54,810
If you won't play the tambourine,
at least clap.

798
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:59,523
Love like a good girl
You watch in awe when I dance

799
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:04,153
But you act like you didn't and judge me

800
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,404
How pathetic.

801
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:08,032
You're such a hypocrite

802
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:15,790
With a heart that should forget

803
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:20,044
I closed the door

804
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,756
To my empty room

805
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:29,804
Your scent still lingers

806
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:33,432
Filling my

807
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,602
Empty room

808
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,022
Here, alone
I lay down and...

809
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:42,525
Thought he'd be more of
"This Is The Moment" kind of guy.

810
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:45,569
I guess he's not.
He's a Kim Kwang-seok kind of guy.

811
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,782
What kind of guy is that?

812
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:53,327
Probably a guy
with unique, newtro sentiments.

813
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,412
That kind of guy is so predictable.

814
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,040
He buys greens from an old lady
on the streets,

815
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,792
has a cat,

816
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,418
and runs marathons.

817
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,046
You know the type.
A man bun with a chopstick.

818
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,090
-And uses eco-friendly stuff.
-Yeah.

819
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,135
He's probably into women
who drink milk tea

820
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,262
and read books about world peace.

821
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,763
Yes.

822
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,181
I see what you mean.

823
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,648
Isn't he kind of romantic, though?

824
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,693
Who? How?

825
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:30,823
You know, he's aloof,
looks kind of lonesome,

826
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,825
and a little sexy.

827
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,703
A man I'd awfully
want to be involved with?

828
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:38,080
Awfully want to be involved?

829
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:42,084
You are a lustful lady.
What do I do with you?

830
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:45,754
Come on, Su-hyeok
used to be pretty popular.

831
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:52,094
On my illuminated foggy window

832
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,973
I write and erase

833
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:01,312
I love you

834
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,056
Did you give her the ring?

835
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:41,644
Why?

836
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,272
Just curious.

837
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:49,860
It didn't go well?

838
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:51,528
That's not it.

839
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:57,243
It's just that
I didn't get to give it to her yet.

840
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:59,954
Then it's a relief.

841
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:05,334
But, how come you didn't give it to her?

842
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,961
You bought a ring.

843
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,337
Why didn't you give it to her?

844
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,339
Is it yours?

845
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:14,426
You have many rings already. So greedy.

846
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,356
I don't have any here.

847
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,737
You think it's that easy?

848
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:39,285
It's not easy for a man
to just take out the ring from his pocket.

849
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,622
If you want it that badly, ask him for it.

850
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:49,420
I know, right?

851
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:53,257
A guy is thinking when and how
he should give her a ring.

852
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:57,303
If his girlfriend says she wants a ring,

853
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:01,056
that'd be adorable, right?

854
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,061
Well, maybe.

855
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,531
How do I look? Do I look okay?

856
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,158
What?

857
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:24,163
Thanks so much.

858
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,462
Good luck!

859
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,816
Hey, Su-hyeok.

860
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,526
Where are you going? Where is she?

861
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:55,444
Over there.

862
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:56,570
It's switched.

863
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:57,780
What?

864
01:00:58,364 --> 01:01:01,200
Sir, let me turn on the light
for a moment.

865
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:16,340
I liked saying I love you back,
when he said he loved me.

866
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,760
Because of that, because it's him,
because that's us.

867
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,764
That is why I've waited for the moment
where I say, "Yes."

868
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,850
When he asks me, "Will you marry me?"

869
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:30,771
But I shall not wait any longer.

870
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:34,983
I'm on my way to him
to say it first tonight.

871
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:38,779
That's right.
It doesn't matter who says it first.

872
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,369
Will you marry me?

873
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,041
Would you like me to marry you?

874
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,591
I should tell him to come out.

875
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,343
It's tonight.

876
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,764
What is this?

877
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,357
Whatever.

878
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:22,197
It will be the end of us just dating.

879
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:24,658
What a complete happy ending it will be.

880
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,888
TRUE TO LOVE

881
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:13,350
I tried.
And everything was getting better.

882
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,352
Trying is not love.

883
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:17,688
Love? What you have with her is love?

884
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,356
Think whatever you want.

885
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:21,483
Why are you here?

886
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:22,943
Did you follow me?

887
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:24,319
Aren't you hurt?

888
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:26,863
She was on a high horse,
being a dating coach.

889
01:04:26,947 --> 01:04:28,365
What's this?

890
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,117
Bo-ra saw?

891
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,619
Did you do it? Was this the only time?

892
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:35,247
-This isn't love, is it?
-That is love.

893
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,624
You two don't take cheating seriously?

894
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:39,418
Did you just not get caught cheating?

895
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:40,752
I'm just sad.

896
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:43,213
I'm in front of your house. Come out.

897
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,048
Everyone gets married after dating?

898
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,717
You've done nothing wrong?

899
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,720
What's this? In front of
a pile of garbage, what's this?

900
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:51,847
Because you're garbage!

901
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:55,642
Hey, come here!

902
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,436
Take me, please!
