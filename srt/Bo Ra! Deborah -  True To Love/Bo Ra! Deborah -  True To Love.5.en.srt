1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,963
TRUE TO LOVE

2
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,956
TRUE TO LOVE

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,501
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS, AND
INCIDENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,848
She thinks there's no one outside?

5
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,204
WOO BAR
COFFEE AND WINE

6
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,500
So you wandered around all day
looking like a woman with some sad past?

7
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,626
Yes.

8
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,380
Even the melody and lyrics
that sounded cliché

9
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,841
are so relatable and move me to tears now.

10
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,430
I realized that
my love was just another cliché.

11
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,058
I know that, but...

12
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,770
I don't know
why I'm being such a drama queen.

13
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,984
It's been rough so I'm
in this state of emotional turmoil.

14
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,695
I think I know what you mean.

15
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,532
I thought we'd be different from
other married couples,

16
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:59,370
but after getting married,
I realized that we're not any different.

17
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,122
The feeling that I had
when I realized that...

18
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,210
Sadness, I guess?

19
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:11,882
I know it is just life,
but why do I feel so sad?

20
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,887
What's wrong?
Did you have a fight with Jin-woo?

21
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,183
It'd be better if we fight bitterly
and make up passionately.

22
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,477
We don't fight 'cause we're lukewarm.

23
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,231
Today is just like yesterday.
Tomorrow is no different than today.

24
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,942
Well, that's warm.

25
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,987
Being in a warm relationship
is such a great thing.

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,154
Is it?

27
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,869
I realized something
while wandering about outside.

28
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,913
I felt like people were
busy all day cursing me.

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:50,087
But people are too busy
to care about a person like me.

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,173
The world has already moved on
and forgotten about Deborah.

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,758
Were you disappointed?

32
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,765
I found comfort in that.

33
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:09,148
Over time, will people forget
what happened and things be okay?

34
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:11,984
Hopefully.

35
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,200
It was cold.

36
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,163
This too shall pass.

37
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,583
Really?

38
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,626
Yes.

39
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,341
Will it pass, really?

40
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,383
Of course.

41
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:42,431
EP 05
A COLD IS INCURABLE

42
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,407
DEBORAH SAYS!

43
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,517
Let's see.

44
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,312
Every love story has an ending.

45
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,274
The moment when lovers
pledge their love for eternity.

46
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,279
What we need now
for a perfect happy ending

47
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,489
is a proposal.

48
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,457
Looks like it will take more time
for the world

49
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,835
to move on
and forget about Deborah completely.

50
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,754
Saw this month's issue?

51
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,925
Yes, I did. It was kindly sent to me,
so I had to see it.

52
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,013
She went to trouble to send
a complimentary copy of the issue.

53
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,180
Well...

54
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,308
Is this the chief editor's
idea of a punishment?

55
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,644
"You know your own sins."

56
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,440
She does hold grudges against Deborah.
That's a fact.

57
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,942
She's a grudge holder.
See what she does to me.

58
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,027
But in this case,

59
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,780
it's more likely her assistant
sent it without thinking twice.

60
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,240
Hey.

61
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,869
How many copies of La Bella
are sold per month?

62
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,246
Korea's No. 1 selling magazine.

63
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,458
La Bella Magazine's circulation
is around 100,000.

64
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,210
Why are you curious about that
all of a sudden?

65
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,087
So 100,000 copies...

66
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,592
For 12,000 won, 100,000 copies...

67
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:43,927
It's 1.2 billion won.

68
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,097
I don't have 1.2 billion won.

69
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,599
What are you saying?

70
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,603
Hey, you can't be serious...

71
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,421
Let me pay for these.

72
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,927
Paris Hilton was arrested
for stealing from a newsstand her DVD,

73
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,305
which had already went viral
on the Internet.

74
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:29,640
Wait.

75
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,561
That was not because
she was a dumb heiress.

76
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,858
Now I can understand her.

77
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,236
SEARCH BOOKS

78
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,071
I know all she could think about...

79
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,114
LA BELLA
OUT OF STOCK

80
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,323
...was this one thing.

81
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,035
"I can't let more people see this,
not even one more."

82
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,037
THIS ITEM IS CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK.

83
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,498
Unexpected good news.

84
00:06:56,375 --> 00:07:00,546
The September issue of La Bella
is sold out in just two days.

85
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,048
A second pressrun has been decided.

86
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,886
To celebrate this triumph,
dinner is on me today.

87
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,305
Another good news.

88
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,809
I'll give you my credit card
and make myself scarce.

89
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,228
So feel more free to enjoy.

90
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,440
You should at least have dinner with us.

91
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,568
-Have fun.
-Thank you!

92
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,038
Oh, no.

93
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:40,961
Who buys hard copies of magazines
these days? How can it be sold out?

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,215
If it's sold out, it's sold out.
Why a second pressrun?

95
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,508
I know.

96
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,344
The cover of this issue
happens to be BLACKPINK.

97
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,015
It's BLACKPINK. You should give up.

98
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,239
How's Deborah? How's she holding up?

99
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,282
What?

100
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,994
She got cheated on, didn't she?

101
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,245
What a jerk.

102
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,498
I don't know that much...

103
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,085
Why do you keep asking me these questions?

104
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,339
Should I repeat?
You know, female friendships are...

105
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,050
I do know about female friendships.

106
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,551
You get jealous sometimes,

107
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,845
but cry together
when your friend is in pain.

108
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,388
Comfort her.

109
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:36,850
Tell her breaking off an engagement
is way better than divorce.

110
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,186
Use my story as an example, if needed.

111
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,647
Nothing can be more comforting than that.

112
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,648
Su-jin.

113
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,149
Really.

114
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,486
You're really cool sometimes.

115
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,657
Don't call me like that.
It's "ma'am." I'm editor in chief.

116
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,536
Until when? Why should I?

117
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,457
Because that makes it easier
for me to nag you.

118
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,933
That is absurd.

119
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,685
What's gotten into you?

120
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,233
It's sold out.
It'll have a second pressrun.

121
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,154
After the column was out,
the public sentiment has shifted.

122
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,198
She was dumped just before marriage.

123
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,077
"That's why she did that.
I can understand her."

124
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,414
"It's understandable.
In that situation, even I would..."

125
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,417
You said it's the end of Deborah.
After all that, what now?

126
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,338
You are a fickle creature, right?

127
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,922
Dude, don't call me fickle.

128
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,050
People are fickle creatures.

129
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,053
We have an urge to drag down
someone who's going up.

130
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,681
When someone is stuck deep in the mud,
we root for them to get back up.

131
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,392
When you come to think of it,

132
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
people go wild about a fatty-turned-hottie

133
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,899
than a woman
who has always been slim and pretty.

134
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,778
People love a contestant who says,
"Okay, everything's going as planned."

135
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,490
even in a fiery pit, and eventually
makes an amazing comeback.

136
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,409
Why? Because there's a dramatic twist.

137
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,661
All right, I see, a twist.

138
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,164
But what about this twist

139
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,542
in which you got too scared
and stabbed her in the back?

140
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,004
And if you become eager
to sign her again now,

141
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,798
what would she think of us?

142
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,010
"They are very business-savvy."

143
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:20,430
In other words, it's called "a lowlife."

144
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,265
That's what it's called.

145
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,268
Am I the only scum?
Am I the only one that's disgusting?

146
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,730
Don't you want to be rich?
Are you a communist or what?

147
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,858
Just think about it.

148
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,941
Politicians?

149
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,778
They love to be mentioned in the media
in any way except for an obituary.

150
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,239
Popularity? Integrity? They don't care.

151
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,950
Public profile and approval rating
go hand in hand.

152
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,953
You said Deborah was a fraud,
now she's like a politician?

153
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:29,958
You are the one who called her a fraud.
I never said she was a fraud.

154
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,712
You called her Yeon Fox since she's sly
and you said it's over for her.

155
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,923
-That's more harsh...
-Seriously, these people...

156
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,801
Let's forget about that.
Let's focus on the content.

157
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,470
-Just the content.
-Excuse me...

158
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,556
Do you know what kind of content...

159
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,391
How may I help you?

160
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,435
Well, that's...

161
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,815
Could you hand this over
to the vice president, please?

162
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,945
Who should I say this is from?
May I ask your name?

163
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,574
Oh, I'm...

164
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,911
Dating coach Deborah
who got dumped like trash.

165
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,456
She got knocked down in front of
the whole world, showing her panties.

166
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,459
She has an epic story of failure.

167
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,296
You heard that. The main character
of an epic failure story.

168
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,423
Tell him it's from writer Deborah.

169
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,093
You know what I mean?

170
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,430
Rocky is way too old.

171
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,517
Writer Deborah was just here.

172
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,561
She heard everything.

173
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:38,527
She wanted me to
hand this over to you, Su-hyeok.

174
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:44,950
Why did you...

175
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,647
Why do I have to pick up the pieces again?

176
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,650
You've saved her like in The Bodyguard.

177
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,610
Considering the things I said,

178
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,155
it would be better
coming from you than me.

179
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,575
You want me to go find her and do what?

180
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,953
Ask her how she's doing,
say something comforting,

181
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,705
and then apologize to her.

182
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,332
If it goes well,
segue into the contract discussion.

183
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,294
I'll apologize and that's it.
That's the main purpose.

184
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,009
I'm not offering my condolences
nor visiting her in hospital.

185
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:50,390
To a person who got her heart broken,
what am I supposed to say to her?

186
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,226
Those who have endured
similar situations would know.

187
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,645
So you should know better than me.
Why ask me?

188
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,315
That's exactly why
I'm asking you, a divorcé.

189
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,483
Jeez, you're at it again.

190
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,947
Comforting is not complicated. Just...

191
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,452
Just say, "You are better than I am."

192
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,954
"Even a guy like me doesn't skip a meal."

193
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,873
-That's it.
-What does that mean?

194
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,376
Sometimes others' misfortune
can be the best way to feel comforted.

195
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,754
"I'm not the only one who's doomed."

196
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,340
"Right, I'm better than you are."

197
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,550
"Even a guy like you doesn't skip a meal."

198
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,218
Something like that.

199
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,806
"Even a guy like that
eats three meals a day."

200
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,477
That makes sense.

201
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,357
How can you sit there and eat that?

202
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,070
It's good.

203
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,664
WRITER DEBORAH

204
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,166
I have something to tell you.
I'm near your house.

205
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,502
I'll wait until you come.

206
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:22,148
-I hardly recognized you.
-What?

207
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,864
It's intentional.
People hardly recognize me this way.

208
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,120
I was joking.

209
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,877
About what happened earlier
at our company, please accept my apology.

210
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,212
No apology needed.

211
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,716
Everyone talks behind everyone's back.

212
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,012
I've been under so much fire these days
that it didn't even sting.

213
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,145
Also, I've been meaning to tell you this.

214
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,233
Let's just cancel our contract.

215
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,778
If you say a verbal contract
is still a contract, I have no excuse.

216
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,822
But...

217
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,535
I don't think I can write a book
about love anymore.

218
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,835
Okay. It's a shame, but I understand.

219
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,343
Still, I owe you an apology.
It was an offensive and rude thing to say.

220
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm really sorry.

221
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,057
Hope you don't take it too seriously.

222
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,022
Do you want something to drink?

223
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,275
-Is it on you?
-Of course.

224
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,861
I'll have the same.

225
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,410
This place is famous for tea.

226
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,787
-This way, please.
-Okay.

227
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,280
-What would you like to drink?
-This one. Thanks.

228
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,922
Here you go.

229
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,428
Is he looking this way?

230
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,643
-Why are you crying?
-I said, "Is he looking this way?"

231
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:10,817
Bo-ra.

232
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,318
It's not what you think.

233
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,575
Yes, he's looking this way.

234
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,748
-Smile.
-Why?

235
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,377
Just smile, please.

236
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,035
Let's walk together for a bit more.

237
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,330
Sure.

238
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,472
Smile.

239
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,350
Okay.

240
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,619
I didn't tell you to hold my hand.

241
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,708
He's still looking at us.

242
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,398
Naturally, smile.

243
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,842
Oh, I remembered.

244
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,303
When bullies take money from you,

245
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:49,308
they put their arms around your shoulder
and say, "Hey, smile. Act naturally."

246
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,645
"We're friends, okay?"
You know that, right?

247
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,901
DAD'S CHICKEN

248
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,784
Why is she going to a chicken place?

249
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,959
Deep-fried chicken, please.

250
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,464
That one, please.

251
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,548
Okay.

252
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,595
Fried chicken is the best.
Seems like you don't know that.

253
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,765
Because it's special.

254
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,519
Since nobody loves me, from now on,
I decided to start loving myself.

255
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,355
Now, if I order jjamppong,
I'll get a special one.

256
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,483
As for soju, I'll have the 30,000 won one.

257
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,818
I'll order expensive stuff,
something special.

258
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,653
That's positive thinking.

259
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,324
Would you like to order alcohol?

260
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,368
The most expensive alcohol here...

261
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,996
We're not close enough for that.

262
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,290
Let's just have soft drinks.

263
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,542
Two drinks, please.

264
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,003
Right.

265
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,923
Now that I know
you make quite a scene when drunk.

266
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:02,924
Good thinking.

267
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,470
This is on me.

268
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,056
Since I owe you one.

269
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,600
Let's call it even.

270
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:15,937
Okay.

271
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,856
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

272
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,782
So good.

273
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,785
Dad's Chicken is the best.

274
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,708
Is that why you came here?

275
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,504
A little revenge on Mom's Chicken?

276
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:49,929
So that's why...

277
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,569
I don't get why you're always
there to witness those moments.

278
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,615
I know.

279
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,918
He got a haircut.

280
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,630
I've never seen that shirt before.

281
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,847
That means he went to a salon

282
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,766
and said,
"Actor Jung Hae-in hairstyle, please."

283
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,271
And tried on that shirt at a mall
in front of the mirror...

284
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,067
while I'm like this.

285
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,241
I admit that I lost.

286
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,494
I'm just a loser.

287
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,123
Who was I to keep
yapping about relationships?

288
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,542
So ludicrous, right?

289
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,340
So you can't write books about love?

290
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,717
Yes.

291
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,304
To be exact, I have nothing
to say about relationships.

292
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,348
You keep saying that.

293
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,017
There's no winner or loser
in a relationship.

294
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,644
Yes, there is.

295
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,689
Memories are exclusively
for the winner as well.

296
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,358
When he thinks of me,

297
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,903
he'll probably think,
"She was a woman I used to love."

298
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,404
That would be it.

299
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,369
But I would completely fall apart.

300
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,539
You saw that earlier.

301
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,920
What if you lose? So what?

302
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,881
"I lost, but it was a good fight."

303
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,175
You can think of it that way.

304
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,176
No way.

305
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,470
If you lost, how is that a good fight?

306
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,722
If you had a good fight, you'd win.

307
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,766
There's this song as well.

308
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,229
You're not going to sing here, right?

309
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,190
Is this really Sprite?

310
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,486
I won't.

311
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,156
So when it comes to
romantic relationships,

312
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,325
it's winner takes all.

313
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,289
The loser just stands there feeling small.

314
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,875
'Cause that's the fate of a loser.

315
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,141
Sprite tastes bitter today.

316
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,145
By the way, why do you hate me so much?

317
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:45,896
I don't hate you.

318
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,566
Why would I hate you?

319
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:53,070
Like telephone poles,
signs on the buildings, and crosswalks.

320
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,197
What is there to hate?

321
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,910
You don't hate me,
but you talk behind my back?

322
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,126
I hope that's the case for
the haters on the Internet.

323
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,972
Now you feel sorry for me?

324
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,434
That's why you helped me earlier, right?

325
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,520
I don't feel sorry for you.

326
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,398
I once took care of a deer
that was killed on a road.

327
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,777
I've reported a drunk
who fell asleep at a bus station.

328
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,112
I randomly do a favor
for others sometimes.

329
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,281
Deer...

330
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,371
Meant to make you smile.

331
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,716
Sometimes others' misfortune
can be the best way to feel comforted.

332
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,428
"I'm not the only one who's doomed."

333
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,102
In fact, I got dumped too.

334
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:08,896
The ring I bought,

335
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,776
I didn't get around to take it out.
I got dumped big time.

336
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,948
Keep going.

337
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:24,203
What is this feeling? Hearing that
oddly makes me feel a little better.

338
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,749
Suddenly she wanted to break up,
and she said

339
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,502
I'm a cowardly, mean,

340
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,922
and selfish jerk.
I think that's what she said.

341
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,925
So harsh.

342
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,430
-And?
-And?

343
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,522
The other day,
I went in front of her house.

344
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,239
She was coming out with some man.

345
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,619
If they were coming out, not going in...

346
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:16,338
And? How is it? Do you feel okay?

347
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:22,052
Does it get better with time?

348
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,064
I guess it doesn't.

349
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,155
As you can see,

350
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,700
it got better to the point where
I'm okay talking about it.

351
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,913
Among the top ten incurable diseases
in the world,

352
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,748
do you know what's in first place?

353
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:55,753
The common cold.

354
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:01,467
Although we come down with it sometimes,
we get over it before we know it.

355
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,553
This is like the common cold.

356
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:10,476
Everything will be all right
as if nothing happened.

357
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,242
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

358
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:34,542
-Thanks for the chicken.
-Sure.

359
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:39,672
Bye.

360
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,518
I'll walk you home.

361
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,395
'Cause I live nearby.

362
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,149
Okay.

363
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:21,839
You want a hug?

364
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,426
Why?

365
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,678
'Cause you're shaking so much.

366
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,099
Let me remind you. I randomly
do a favor for others sometimes.

367
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,100
Oh, my.

368
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,312
Are you giving out a free hug as a favor?

369
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,688
No thanks.

370
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,444
Are you coming down with something?

371
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,196
It's nice outside, why are you shaking?

372
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,867
Maybe I have an incurable disease.

373
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,786
It doesn't matter.

374
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,330
Based on what you said,

375
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,790
I'll be fine soon.

376
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:02,296
I'm honored that
a dating coach listened to me.

377
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:08,427
I've never been dumped before,
though I'm a dating coach.

378
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,721
As if I've been dumped a lot before.

379
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:19,605
Then, you do have something
to say about romantic relationships.

380
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,197
You can write about
what comes next after a breakup.

381
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,784
You either get over him or win him back,

382
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,662
or meet a better guy,

383
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,538
or find a different ending.

384
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,461
So this is how it goes.

385
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:45,964
You show empathy, make me feel better,
then talk about work.

386
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,634
You came with a purpose.

387
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,095
Business is difficult, isn't it?

388
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,180
What do you mean?

389
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:58,310
You saw me in this state and still suggest
we write a book about romance?

390
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:04,024
What more would people want to hear
from me about romantic relationships?

391
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,318
Just be satisfied with seeing my panties.

392
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,073
I didn't curse just now.

393
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,701
I don't curse anymore.
I set my mind to it.

394
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:20,124
And once again, let me make this clear.

395
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:23,961
I have no inclination
to make a fool out of myself again.

396
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,631
See, I'm financially stable enough.
So I don't need to

397
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,801
use my past, stories,
or tears to make a living.

398
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:34,555
-There's no chance I'll work with you.
-You call yourself a writer.

399
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,266
As a writer, isn't it your duty

400
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,978
to think about how irresponsible
a sudden, sad ending is?

401
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,855
Do you know why it's bad?

402
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,109
People hope for things to work out
and wounds to heal.

403
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,988
And with all this, as a better person,
for life to move on.

404
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,949
You're taking those hopes away.

405
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,662
Whatever.

406
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,834
Don't expect me to be that professional.
I have my issues to deal with.

407
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,003
I can't afford to
care about anything else.

408
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,591
Here we are. This is me.

409
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,266
Let's not see each other again.

410
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:25,063
From now on, even if
you see me crying, falling,

411
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,399
or even hit by a car,
please just pass me by.

412
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,277
I've been embarrassed enough. No more.

413
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,496
Sure, I will.

414
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:45,042
I kept becoming a witness unintentionally.
Any more than this would be dangerous.

415
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,879
Still, if you get hit by a car,
I'll at least call for an ambulance.

416
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,645
The door is open.

417
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,146
Anton Chekhov once said,

418
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,401
"If there's a gun in the first chapter,
in the third, it must go off."

419
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,904
"Dating coach Deborah

420
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,407
who used to be so confident about love
failed in her relationship?"

421
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,576
Then there should be the next part.

422
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,081
She eats special chicken. That's it?

423
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,707
Really?

424
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,378
Such a showoff till the end.

425
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,215
Antonio, who... What are you saying?

426
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,633
Bye.

427
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,729
Where am I?

428
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:05,998
Whatever.

429
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,315
I thought that I have done enough,

430
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,942
that I accepted it,

431
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,612
and that there's no tears left to cry.

432
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,700
But the moment I encountered him,

433
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:49,124
I realized that I was
still in the middle of a breakup.

434
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,285
This is just a cold.

435
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,288
This is just a cold.

436
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,237
You think you can
make it up to me this way?

437
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,704
You scared me!

438
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,082
You're late.

439
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,753
-I fell asleep.
-You did?

440
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,589
-I told you we had a staff dinner.
-You did.

441
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,733
Yu-jeong.

442
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,029
What is with you?

443
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:51,621
Cold!

444
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,125
Hey! Yang Jin-woo!

445
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,518
Jin-woo.

446
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:15,896
Did I get fat?

447
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,815
I don't know. Did you?

448
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:20,067
Do I look so?

449
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,655
No, not at all.

450
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,991
You should gain weight.
What are you saying?

451
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:31,078
I wouldn't want to gain weight.

452
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:42,047
Did my boobs get smaller?

453
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,256
No?

454
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:50,138
I don't know. Did they?

455
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,642
You don't care.

456
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,143
I know the answer.

457
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,813
You didn't gain weight
and your boobs aren't smaller.

458
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,064
Wrong.

459
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,776
"You always look beautiful to me
every single moment."

460
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,322
Where are you going, babe?

461
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,532
To dry my hair.

462
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:09,991
Babe.

463
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,036
Do that later. Come on over.

464
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,417
-What is it, out of the blue?
-Come here already.

465
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,379
Seriously...

466
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,256
Come over here. Hurry!

467
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:28,718
Hurry up!

468
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,012
Stop it! Come here already.

469
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,433
Brother, come on in.

470
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,854
Come on in.

471
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:42,107
Goodness.

472
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,151
Just sleep.

473
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,403
What?

474
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,254
Let's clean up.

475
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,282
PRESIDENT HAN SANG-JIN

476
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:39,998
ANNE OF GREEN GABLES

477
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,597
I haven't seen this in years.

478
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,146
Good morning, Sang-jin.

479
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,357
Good morning to you too, U-ri.

480
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,775
Yes.

481
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:09,694
You came in early again.

482
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,198
I told you. You don't need to.

483
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,784
I can read if I come early.

484
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,494
I like it.

485
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,829
If you say so.

486
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:23,875
I got something for you. One second.

487
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,428
Hello, Su-hyeok.

488
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,347
Oh, hi.

489
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,850
What's with him?

490
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,067
So she said "no."

491
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,946
What kind of "no" was it?

492
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,531
What do you mean?

493
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,700
I mean,

494
00:42:57,826 --> 00:43:00,996
was it a "no" as in,
"I can't forgive what you guys did."

495
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,623
"I can't just let it go
and will only be satisfied

496
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,750
if I squash the offer at least once"?

497
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:09,170
Or, "I'm technically taking
a hiatus from all my activities

498
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:11,631
to reflect on myself
after the controversy,

499
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,675
but if you keep making attempts,

500
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:18,555
I'm willing to pretend to give in."
That kind of "no."

501
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,641
Running a business is difficult, indeed.

502
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:23,685
But then again,

503
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,229
I doubt that you can tell the difference.

504
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,442
Let me analyze it. Tell me word for word.

505
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,110
What did she say exactly?

506
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,864
"Again, let me make this clear."

507
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,992
I have no inclination
to make a fool out of myself again.

508
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,076
I'm stable financially

509
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,288
so I don't need to use my past,
stories, or tears for a living.

510
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,124
"So there's no chance
I'll ever work with you."

511
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:52,297
That's a "no" with
no room for interpretation.

512
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,595
Okay, this is it then.

513
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,558
You raised hell about
how you don't want to do this.

514
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,770
You think, "Good riddance."
It worked out fine for you.

515
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,104
No.

516
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,817
It was starting to get interesting.

517
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,045
There'll be a shower today.
Bring an umbrella.

518
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,924
Quite a temperature gap these days.
Be sure to bundle up. Don't catch a cold.

519
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,967
Is he a weather forecaster?

520
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,904
You're one more text away
from being blocked.

521
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,616
Still,

522
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,535
I still have one more chance.

523
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,879
You have sufficient work experience.

524
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,465
You live nearby.

525
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,970
Am I hired then?

526
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,766
Can you start tomorrow?

527
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,143
Sure thing.

528
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,270
-I'll call you.
-Thank you.

529
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,022
Thank you.

530
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,569
Come, please.

531
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:41,698
Sorry about the wait.

532
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:43,658
No worries, I was early.

533
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,959
RÉSUMÉ

534
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,711
PARKING ASSISTANCE
DISH WASHING

535
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,422
No cafe experience.

536
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,590
No.

537
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,717
By the way, reason for application says...

538
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,802
I WAS DRAWN BY IRRESISTIBLE DESTINY.

539
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:03,970
Yes.

540
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,556
I applied because I was drawn by destiny.

541
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,728
"Woo Bar Café."

542
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,773
"Mapo-gu."

543
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,736
COMPANY LOCATION

544
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,869
I'll kill you if you follow me.

545
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:43,510
I see. Anyways...

546
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,888
-Yang Jin-ho?
-Yes.

547
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,516
I'm Yang Jin-woo.
Which Yang clan are you from?

548
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,184
I'm Namwon Yang.

549
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,938
Me too. Your childhood nicknames?

550
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,773
Yanker, Yin-yang,

551
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:57,941
-Yankee.
-Yankee.

552
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,484
-Exactly!
-I know.

553
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:05,490
I see no address.

554
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,953
I'll look for a place nearby.
I just got out of the army.

555
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,412
Which division?

556
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,373
I was in the 3rd Infantry Division.

557
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,208
-White Skull?
-Yes.

558
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,751
I was in that division too.

559
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,461
White Skull chant, ready!

560
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:19,837
Start!

561
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:23,049
Dead or alive, we're White Skull!

562
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,261
You survive if you try to die!
Love for your flesh and blood!

563
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,555
White Skull, White Skull! Let's go!

564
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:32,809
No wonder.

565
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,853
The moment I saw you,
I knew I found a kindred spirit.

566
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,730
Like I met a long-lost big brother.

567
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,190
Like destiny.

568
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,194
That's true. Our name and all.

569
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,446
-Yang Jin-ho, Yang Jin-woo.
-Yes.

570
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,658
I'm never late.

571
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,786
I'm healthy
so I'll never be absent without notice.

572
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,913
I will work really hard if you hire me.

573
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,999
Okay. You're hired!

574
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:57,709
Thank you!

575
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,794
White Skull!

576
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:01,921
White Skull!

577
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,174
Do you know wine well?

578
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:07,176
-Please teach me.
-It's easy.

579
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:51,846
This is like the common cold.

580
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:56,017
Everything will be all right
as if nothing happened.

581
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,399
Little did he know at that time

582
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:09,155
that false hopes
lead to deeper despair afterward.

583
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:25,546
It's almost quitting time already.

584
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,759
Right, my fellow employees
have worked hard today.

585
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,427
They should go home.

586
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,388
They should go home.

587
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,349
There's no boss like me.

588
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:40,728
Everybody, wrap it up
and get ready to go home.

589
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,815
-We're off.
-Bye.

590
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:46,693
Bye.

591
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,488
So quick. Really quick.

592
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,366
Hey, when I was their age...

593
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,538
I wonder why I couldn't do that.

594
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,876
Wait, are you leaving?

595
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,920
We should have a drink.

596
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,463
I guess you didn't know.

597
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,757
I'm not going to drink with you
for a while.

598
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:10,675
Why?

599
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,762
Are you still holding a grudge
for what happened last time?

600
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:19,100
Why can't you just let it go?

601
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,478
You can't get over disappointment
or your ex.

602
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,982
This is why
I don't want to drink with you.

603
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,153
Then where are you going to go?

604
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,699
Are you going to do something weird
like stalking?

605
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:38,870
Such as, missing Yu-ri
and going in front of her house,

606
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,372
or seeking solitude along the Han River.

607
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,250
No way, like those scenes in movies?

608
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:55,678
I thought it was the right thing to do
and I let her go like a man.

609
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,308
I hoped she became truly happy
in a new relationship.

610
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,520
But the moment I saw her
with a new lover already,

611
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,690
until then,

612
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,401
I hadn't realized we broke up.

613
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,810
This small, sparkly, and expensive thing.

614
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,897
What do I do with it?

615
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:53,945
This morning, a woman in her 30s
threw herself off the Manam Bridge

616
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,656
and was found dead in the end.

617
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,909
Traffic in the vicinity
came to a halt for two hours,

618
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:02,078
causing severe traffic delays.

619
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,872
According to the police,
the family of the deceased stated

620
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,916
that the deceased often got drunk

621
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:10,753
and claimed to be depressed
after her recent breakup and job loss.

622
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:15,550
Police believe she attempted suicide
while intoxicated

623
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,886
and are investigating
the exact cause of her death.

624
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,388
Moving on to the next story.

625
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,189
Like how I did not know back then,

626
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,612
people see what they want to see
and believe what they want to believe.

627
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,576
What are you going to do
if I want to break up?

628
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:44,370
-If we break up...
-That's ridiculous.

629
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:48,332
That won't happen, even if the sky falls
or the ground crumbles away.

630
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,626
It's not what you think.

631
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,879
It's just a mistake. A one-time mistake.

632
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,674
I'm in front of your house.
I'll wait till you come.

633
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,221
I'm sorry.

634
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,182
Maybe,

635
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:09,812
he might be regretting now like I am.

636
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,660
I really enjoyed the dinner.

637
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,290
The lobster was so flavorful...

638
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,709
The butter was...

639
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,175
Absolutely unbelievable.

640
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,303
Right.

641
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,515
Only the winner gets to enjoy memories.

642
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,328
Yesterday, did he...

643
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,830
Do you remember the way he looked at me?

644
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,374
Ms. Yeon?

645
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,043
Who did you call?

646
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,712
Didn't he look regretful?

647
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:19,298
You said he kept looking at me yesterday.

648
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,426
Are you drunk?

649
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,471
Please just say so.

650
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:28,516
Tell me he seemed to regret
breaking up with me.

651
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,644
I need some courage right now.

652
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,903
No.

653
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,907
He seemed relieved, let alone regretful.

654
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,743
So stop drinking.

655
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,538
Stop whatever you were going to do
and sleep tight.

656
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,208
No, stop lying.

657
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,168
You are a liar.

658
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:58,504
You're lying.

659
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,464
You said it'll be all right.

660
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:04,677
You said it'll be all right.
It's not all right at all.

661
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,472
I feel like I'm going to die!
You know that?

662
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:15,122
Had I not had coffee
with Yu-jeong at that time,

663
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,208
we wouldn't have met, right?

664
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,002
Even if we did not meet at that moment,

665
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:22,463
we would have met
at some point in our lives.

666
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,672
I'm sure of that.

667
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:28,135
If I get married,
would you come to my wedding?

668
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,053
Of course I will.

669
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,305
Is there a wedding without a groom?

670
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,809
Who said I'll marry you?
I could marry someone else.

671
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,430
Oh, my gosh!

672
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:52,803
Ju-wan.

673
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,269
Looks like you worked late.

674
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:02,104
You're late.

675
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,818
Are you drunk?

676
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,323
A little.

677
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,325
A little.

678
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,452
I'm sorry.

679
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,085
You see...

680
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:28,797
What if

681
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,761
I tell you that I'm okay with

682
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:38,182
what I saw the other day,

683
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,478
if I forget everything I saw
and don't care,

684
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,024
then what happens to us?
Will it be different?

685
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:52,905
What the hell are you talking about?

686
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:57,034
You're right.
You're right about everything.

687
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,119
I ruined everything.

688
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:04,124
You and Da-mi, it was just a mistake, I...

689
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:11,882
I didn't trust what you said
and let my temper get the better of me.

690
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,717
That's why we came to this.

691
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,345
So can't we just...

692
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:20,933
Bo-ra...

693
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,894
I'm not saying we should get married.

694
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,188
Can't we just go back...

695
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:32,861
I can't. How am I supposed to live?

696
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,575
It's hard for me too.

697
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:44,415
If it's hard for both of us,
why do we have to break up?

698
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,876
You said it was a misunderstanding
with Da-mi.

699
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,422
So we can work this out.

700
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,341
Please stop.

701
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,681
Are you ever going to stop
making me the bad guy? You...

702
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,309
How low are you going to go?

703
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,394
How can I make you stop?

704
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,981
I hate you.

705
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:10,733
I hate you like crazy.

706
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,402
I'm sick and tired of you.

707
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:18,782
I'm sorry.

708
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:24,580
Ju-wan.

709
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,944
You want a hug?

710
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,701
If you're okay with a free hug.

711
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,889
TRUE TO LOVE

712
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,016
-You said you'd love yourself more.
-Bo-ra!

713
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,560
Why are you so sad?
It's not the end of the world.

714
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:36,939
I looked like a fool earlier, right?
I guess I wanted to do well.

715
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,941
You are doing a heck of a job.

716
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:40,108
I mean it.

717
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,818
You trusted a man, of all things?

718
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:45,364
-You should've trusted real estate.
-I'm about to end up on the streets.

719
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,366
Su-hyeok, are you busy now?

720
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,700
-Hey, what is this?
-What?

721
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,619
Someone is impersonating you.

722
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,372
You're acting out of character.
So down-to-earth.

723
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:54,790
It's all because of Deborah.

724
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:57,501
You could have suspected
something was wrong.

725
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,836
You know how many things
were wrong with you?

726
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,756
You fall, curse, cry anywhere,
get drunk, be a mess.

727
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,175
I thought it was
the most normal thing you've done.

728
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:07,970
-You're saying it's my fault?
-That's not what I meant.

729
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,305
We don't need to
see each other again, right?
