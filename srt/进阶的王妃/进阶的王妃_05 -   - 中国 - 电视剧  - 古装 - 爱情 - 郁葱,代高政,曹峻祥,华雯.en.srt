1
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,385
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,309
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,488
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,200
My lady,

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,240
hasn't everything

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
already been taken care of?

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
I thought

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,160
back then, Lin Hong'er

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,800
didn't tell Xiao Xian
about her family background.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,680
So I could fabricate a new identity.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,560
But now,

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,920
I've gained an extraneous relative,

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,280
one

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,440
that doesn't belong to the Xu family.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,280
The County Princess might not
investigate this matter.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,120
Write to my father.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,560
Tell him to arrange for someone

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
to drive the Luo family

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,840
out of the capital.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,800
My lady,

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,760
doesn't this strike you as odd?

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,320
How is Lady Hong's enemy Mr. Sun?

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,360
Master,

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
Sun Qi is dead.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,200
But complications arose.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,960
Uncle Luo from Hong Linlang's blacklist

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,720
suddenly appeared

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
and disrupted our plan.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
All plans have variables.

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,080
This might not be a bad thing.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,360
But what if Uncle Luo's interference
ruins everything?

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
I guided him there.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,040
I found Xu Ziyi inherently suspicious.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,600
If things go too smoothly,
it'll feel unnatural.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,920
Moreover, our acquaintance
is behind this.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
You mean Princess Ruihua?

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,760
Return and keep Linlang company.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
Master.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,760
I truly understand you less.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I want to help you.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,160
Remember.

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,880
Helping Linlang is helping me.

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,520
I...

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,400
Linlang, are you here?

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Is that Ziyi?

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,800
Yes.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,160
Open the door.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,520
Are you alright?

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,000
I've been worried sick.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm fine.

51
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,120
Last night,

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
I heard you brought people there,

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,120
so I slipped away as planned.

54
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,760
After getting back,
there was no news from you.

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,840
How was everything?

56
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,560
It was okay.

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,840
I took people
to teach that fool a lesson.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,440
He won't dare show his face again.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,720
That's wonderful news!

60
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
Not only do you play music,

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,040
but you also paint?

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,160
I paint all my enemies.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,720
What could've happened to you

64
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,240
to have so many enemies?

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,720
Look.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,680
This is the man you captured last night.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,560
His surname is Sun,

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,880
the Registrar of Lai County.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,840
What's your actual grievance with him?

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,080
He's greedy and lustful.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,560
My family's enemy bribed him with money,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
so he distorted the truth

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,200
to help her escape charges.

74
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,040
There's a woman in your paintings?

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,680
She's no ordinary woman.

76
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,560
No one knows her true identity.

77
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
She's meticulous

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
and exceptionally skilled in deception.

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,200
Linlang,

80
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,040
such people are the hardest
to deal with.

81
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,080
Indeed.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,760
Defeating her
will be extremely difficult.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,200
That's why

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,800
you must help me.

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Don't worry, Linlang.

86
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,800
I'll assist you for sure.

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,640
It's good you're here.

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm relieved to see you safe.

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,720
I'll take my leave now.

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
(Xu Ziyi,)

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,240
(it's your turn.)

92
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,800
That night,

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
I thought Sun

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,480
would implicate Xu Ziyi too.

95
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,760
Unexpectedly, she foiled it.

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,560
However,

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,960
like in chess,

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
blocking one path

99
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,000
might open new possibilities elsewhere.

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,200
(Xu Ziyi...)

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
Master already investigated.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,040
That Sun Qi

103
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,120
truly acted lawlessly.

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
He took bribes and caused injustices.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,400
He has many enemies.

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,120
This time, it might genuinely be
a coincidence.

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
Behind every coincidence

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
lies cause and effect.

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,240
Keeping Hong Linlang in the mansion

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,160
will eventually bring disaster.

111
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,840
Why did the County Princess
insist on keeping her?

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,720
Just to show gratitude

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,240
for playing for Prince Rui?

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,760
His Highness has a weakness for beauty.

115
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,680
Lady Hong is exceptionally beautiful.

116
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
His Highness remained ill,

117
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,720
but kept demanding her performances.

118
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,560
Rumors spread through the mansion.

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,120
Their private affairs

120
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
were vividly described among the maids.

121
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
The County Princess
must have heard the gossip.

122
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,560
Fearing she might spread tales,

123
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,080
she's protecting the reputation.

124
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,440
The bribed maid revealed

125
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,160
Concubine Dou gained His Highness' favor

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
through a magical flower.

127
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
Flower...

128
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,200
Its fragrance stirs desire.

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,120
(I'll use this
to pit them against each other.)

130
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,440
Concubine Dou.

131
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
What a rare visitor!

132
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
I've heard

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,440
this mansion's

134
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,360
rarest treasures reside
in your courtyard.

135
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,200
I came to broaden my horizons.

136
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Apologies for intruding.

137
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
These

138
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,880
are mere tokens of Prince Rui's favor.

139
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,160
He showered my chambers with luxuries.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
The whole mansion knows this.

141
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,760
Curious visitors come frequently.

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,000
Though a bit annoying,

143
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,560
after all, we're all family here.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
It's okay.

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,400
So this is

146
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,680
the flower?

147
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
It actually exists.

148
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,360
What?

149
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,760
Lady Hong mentioned

150
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,320
His Highness planned to
gift her these flowers

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,840
after recovering from illness.

152
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,240
He wanted her chamber

153
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,960
overflowing with their fragrance.

154
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Pity...

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,960
His Highness never regained his health.

156
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,200
So I am really curious

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,960
what's so special

158
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,160
about these flowers

159
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,960
that captivated him so much?

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
Concubine Dou,

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
why are your hands trembling?

162
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,960
Are you unwell?

163
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,840
Yes...

164
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm suddenly feeling unwell.

165
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,960
His Highness gave Lady Hong flowers...

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,280
I need rest.

167
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,000
Please, leave.

168
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,240
I'll take my leave then.

169
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Well...

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,960
Could they...

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,120
Need to ask?

172
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
What are these flowers for?

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,400
They were meant for us...

174
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
I always wondered

175
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
why that random musician appeared

176
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,240
and His Highness

177
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
insisted on sleeping to her music.

178
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
Night after night.

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
This was never about music.

180
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,040
She was seducing His Highness.

181
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,400
No.

182
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I need proof.

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Proof?

184
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:58,897
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

185
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:04,558
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪

186
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:13,105
♪When spring comes, I see the truth♪

187
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:19,204
♪We've changed through the years♪

188
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:25,873
♪Cold lamps reflect pear blossom dew♪

189
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:33,553
♪Worlds change as streams run west♪

190
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:40,579
♪Rains veil hills, gathering sorrows♪
