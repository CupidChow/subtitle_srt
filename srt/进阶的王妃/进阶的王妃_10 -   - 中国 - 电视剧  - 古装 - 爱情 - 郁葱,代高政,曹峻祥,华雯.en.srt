1
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,400
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,216
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:15,552
(County Office)

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,280
Your Highness.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,480
I have no official position.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,320
My sudden visit must be inappropriate.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,960
Not at all.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,400
It's just that certain matters

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,960
require clarification.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,520
Lady Xu came a few days ago,

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,720
and now you come personally.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,520
This humble office

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,480
is honored to serve distinguished guests

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,120
from the mansion.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,760
Lady Xu has been here as well?

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,320
Yes.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
For the Registrar of Lai County?

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,880
Yes! Exactly him.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,480
He disappeared for unknown reasons.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,920
Lady Xu inquired
if anyone searched for him.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,520
She showed kindness

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,840
by taking in his younger sister.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,320
The sister's name?

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,280
Yueya.

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,320
My maid Yueya framed me
for unknown reasons.

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,440
(She's Lady Hong's maid, isn't she?)

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,240
Impossible!

28
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,120
You must be mistaken.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,440
Have you heard?

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Lady Xu grew jealous of Lady Hong

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,200
and framed her.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Why would she be jealous of Lady Hong?

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,560
Competing for Prince Xian...

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,840
Stop the investigation.

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,560
Sun Yueya betrayed her master
with the blackest intent.

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
Have this girl flogged to death.

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,440
Understood.

39
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Try some.

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,040
You barely ate today.

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,840
Does the kitchen's cooking
displease you?

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
During the midday meal,

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
did you hear about the maid's execution?

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,760
I heard it.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
Those fool servants...

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Should've taken her further away
for punishment.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,760
So it won't affect
our appetites for nothing.

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,160
How considerate of you.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,080
Leave us.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,560
But how can you remain indifferent

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,440
to those beaten to death?

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,880
They...

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,800
They committed wrongdoings.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,080
Wrongdoers

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,160
deserve punishment.

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
I thought you'd pity her.

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,160
Why should I pity her?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Isn't that Sun Yueya?

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,040
Weren't you two in frequent contact?

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,560
What are you talking about?

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,440
I don't understand what you're saying.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
You took her from the Prefect's custody,

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,200
didn't you?

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,960
So...

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,040
You've been investigating me.

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
Not you specifically.

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,640
I was investigating Sun Yueya.

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,440
But I am curious.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,800
The person I saw
in your chamber last time

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,760
was clearly her,

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,920
yet you denied it.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,880
What conspiracy are you hiding?

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
If not investigating me,

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,600
then you distrust me.

75
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm wondering if the Sun Yueya matter

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,640
can make Prince Xian see through

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,920
Xu Ziyi's true nature.

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,400
It may not fully expose her,

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,400
but will plant doubt.

80
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,000
No...

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,560
No.

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,960
What is going wrong?

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,560
(Why does he suspect me?)

84
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
Lin Hong'er?

85
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,400
(Hong Linlang?)

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
If Hong Linlang orchestrated this,

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
(since approaching me)

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,240
(and making me capture Mr. Sun,)

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
(what's her aim?)

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
Mr. Sun?

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,800
(He was the one who framed Lin Hong'er.)

92
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,800
Impossible.

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
Impossible.

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,720
Lin Hong'er is dead.

95
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,080
What about Hong Linlang?

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,760
Could she be seeking vengeance?

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,520
Your Highness.

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,000
Your Highness.

99
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,400
Your Highness.

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
I saw Lady Hong sitting
by the lake earlier.

101
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
With such strong winds,

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,200
she might catch cold.

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,320
I must take my leave.

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
Don't actually catch a cold.

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
Such an interesting scene.

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,080
How could Lady Xu not be there?

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,200
You can't drink it.

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,760
Young lady.

109
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,800
Help!

110
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,768
Forgive my impropriety.

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,840
You're soaked too?

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,160
Young lady.

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,800
Wait a moment.

114
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Master Xian.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Fetch writing materials.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Yes.

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,520
I must paint her likeness.

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Tell me.

119
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,000
Have we met somewhere before?

120
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Lady Hong.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,240
Your Highness, it's improper

123
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,000
for you to step forward like this.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,480
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
I acted rashly in the moment.

126
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,720
The way you drank water earlier

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
reminded me of someone I once knew.

128
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,360
You said you mistook my identity.

129
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
Don't come any closer.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
As the Prince Heir,

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,240
breaking decorum

132
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,800
may only earn you reprimands.

133
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
But I'm different.

134
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,440
Just like Yueya, my life

135
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,320
can be snuffed out at will.

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,280
(Hong Linlang.)

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,560
My lady?

138
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,384
(Xu Ziyi's farewell letter)

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,680
"Having stayed here for days,"

140
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,040
"I shouldn't impose further."

141
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,480
"I'll take my leave now."

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
Isn't this a good thing?

143
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,760
Leaving without notice

144
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,360
must mean something's wrong.

145
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,760
Or she was forced to leave.

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,520
Prince Xian, you're here.

147
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,120
Strangely enough,

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
when Prince Xian appeared,

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Lady Hong's complexion

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
turned so pallid.

151
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,200
As one with child,

152
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,840
my complexion naturally fluctuates.

153
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
You've never been pregnant,

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,680
so you wouldn't understand.

155
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
You don't know why she left, either?

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,640
Then this will be complicated.

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,320
What's complicated?

158
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,440
Just let her leave.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
While I disliked her before,

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,880
now

161
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600
her departure

162
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,280
could lead to more appalling incidents
in the manor.

163
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,240
What "appalling incidents" exactly?

164
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,880
You publicly searched for her,

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,160
making the whole city talk.

166
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,800
You even housed her here for so long.

167
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,360
Now she leaves.

168
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,160
Regardless of her reputation,

169
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,160
how will outsiders perceive us

170
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
and you?

171
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,120
Sour.

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Lady Hong,

173
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,040
this doesn't concern you.

174
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Please go back and rest.

175
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,520
I have a proposal.

176
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
Lady Hong,

177
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,360
what do you think?

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,320
Does she have relatives in the capital?

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,240
She has an uncle, right?

180
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,760
Wasn't she going out the other day

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,400
to see her uncle?

182
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Then it's simple.

183
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
We just need to announce publicly

184
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,000
that Lady Xu left temporarily
to visit family.

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,720
This will quell rumors.

186
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Your Highness, you can send someone

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,520
to fetch her uncle's family first.

188
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,160
If she's with them, bring her back.

189
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,800
If not,

190
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,280
have her uncle's family retrieve her.

191
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,040
This plan suffices.

192
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,480
If her uncle handles this,

193
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,800
whether she returns or not,

194
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
the mansion avoids suspicion.

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Gossip will diminish.

196
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,160
Exactly.

197
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,160
Then that's settled.

198
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,040
Why must the Xu family
want us back to Lai County?

199
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Exactly, my dear.

200
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,720
They even sent escorts.

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
If Xu Ziyi fears exposure,

202
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,560
she shouldn't have recruited you
as her uncle.

203
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,640
Well...

204
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,640
I need to rest.

205
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,880
Excuse me, here's your tea.

206
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,480
Please enjoy.

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,440
Young lady,

208
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,560
why are you staring at me?

209
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,240
You don't look well.

210
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,600
How about letting me check your pulse?

211
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:49,395
