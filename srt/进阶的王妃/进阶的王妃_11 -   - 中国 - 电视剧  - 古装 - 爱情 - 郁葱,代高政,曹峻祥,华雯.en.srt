00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,400
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,640
You don't look well.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,840
How about letting me check your pulse?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,120
You can read the pulse?

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,280
That's great!

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,960
Her Highness will take you
into the mansion.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,560
Find a way to lose
those Xu family followers.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,160
Return to the capital
and enter the mansion.

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,080
Your condition isn't ordinary.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,520
Father, Mother,

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,960
that gentleman said I'm unwell.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,600
He wants to treat me inside.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,600
What?

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,336
You...

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,880
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,440
Father! Mother!

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,264
I don't care! I'm going anyway!

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,760
You're asking for trouble!

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,440
Disgraceful girl.

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,160
Get back here!

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
My dear,

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,400
don't hit her!

24
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,264
Something's wrong. After them!

25
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,324
(Posthouse)

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,640
Mother,

27
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,720
why don't we live
in a mansion like this?

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
No! I want to live here too!

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,280
Alright!

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
(Luo Family's testimony)
This is the Luo family's testimony.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,000
I thought they came to clear my name.

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Turns out they fabricated
false testimony.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,160
They claimed I'd been estranged
from my parents.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,320
They said I disobeyed my family

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,960
and accused me of plotting patricide.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
They were crucial witnesses.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,400
Without their testimonies,

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,040
your conviction
wouldn't have been secured so fast.

39
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,160
Uncle,

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,520
Aunt,

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,040
Qing,

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,720
my apologies.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
I forgot about you before.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
How did the Luos enter the mansion?

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,600
Indeed.

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,000
It should be okay, right?

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
This escape attempt

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,520
was meant to
pressure the County Princess

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
into formally recognizing me.

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
Didn't she already

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
bring your family here?

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,160
That counts as acknowledgment.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
Let's get back to the mansion first.

54
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:12,280
Come on.

55
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
This one is delicious.

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,280
Truth be told,

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,480
frankly speaking,

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,480
when I first heard your story,

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,408
none of us

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
believed it.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
That shameless Hong'er...

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,200
Ziyi.

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Hong'er...

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,760
Hong'er is her childhood name.

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
What's good about her?

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,320
She's not ladylike at all.

67
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,360
When I

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,320
arranged her marriage to Mr. Sun,

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,600
her father groveled in gratitude.

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,840
She was unmarriageable otherwise.

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,360
Tell me. How can she compare

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,480
to our Qing?

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,000
Look.

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,880
Beautiful as blossoms,

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,280
divine as a goddess,

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,280
skilled in song and dance.

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,440
Look.

78
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,520
Take a look!

79
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,200
How could she possibly attract

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,280
nobility like you?

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,480
How can we possibly feel no hatred?

82
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:34,080
Father,

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,960
you're drunk.

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,960
Stop drinking.

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,080
I'm not drunk.

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,000
Father.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
I'm not drunk.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Not drunk.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,000
You're back.

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm not drunk.

91
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm not drunk.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,800
Uncle.

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,360
Hong'er?

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,880
No.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,080
- Uncle.
- It's Ziyi.

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,920
Ziyi?

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Then you're Hong'er?

98
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,720
Hong'er.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,640
Hong'er,

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,920
you've changed?

101
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,440
Hong'er.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,360
Hong'er.

103
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm back.

104
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,200
Hong'er.

105
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,200
I won't rest even as a ghost

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,640
until I make your family pay.

107
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
I've wronged you.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,240
I've wronged your family.

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,040
Uncle, you've drunk too much.

110
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,920
- You're drunk.
- You've drunk too much.

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,720
- Aunt.
- Father, you're drunk.

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,800
Help him back, hurry.

113
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,800
I've wronged you.

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,400
Come on.

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
- I've wronged you.
- You're drunk!

116
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,600
I've wronged you.

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
Who are you really?

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,520
Why won't you look at me?

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm not.

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,240
From our very first meeting,

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
you've avoided looking at me.

122
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
Your Highness,

123
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,880
what exactly do you want?

124
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
I don't know.

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,240
I don't know what I want to do.

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,480
I don't know.

127
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
But these crazy thoughts

128
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,560
keep popping into my head.

129
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,920
What's wrong?

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Aren't you crazy?

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,240
The child in my womb

132
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
should sober you up now.

133
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,480
Move.

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Move!

135
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
Do you want to drag us all to death?

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,624
Well...

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
I just want money.

138
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,080
You want money?

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,720
Didn't my father pay you?

140
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
Your father did pay me,

141
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,600
but now that I'm in the mansion,

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
my price naturally goes up.

143
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,320
Price goes up?

144
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,240
Fine.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I'd like to hear your new demand.

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,560
Five thousand taels.

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,480
Are you insane?

148
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,000
Where would I get that much?

149
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,592
Well...

150
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,840
If your family can't afford it,

151
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,880
how did you distort truth to sacrifice

152
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,840
so many innocent lives

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
and sit high as the Princess Consort?

154
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,880
Shut up!

155
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,400
Well...

156
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Fine.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
I agree.

158
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
Give me fifteen days.

159
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
I'll write home

160
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
to have my father send the money.

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,440
Fifteen days?

162
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,960
Very well.

163
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,520
Then we'll stay here those fifteen days.

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,360
When the money arrives,

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,720
we'll leave immediately.

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,312
You...

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,600
These are nice.

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,960
Stop!

169
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,040
Alright.

170
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
This dress doesn't suit you anyway.

171
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,560
Qing would suit it better.

172
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm leaving. Thanks.

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
(I need to eliminate
this threat quickly)

174
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,480
(before complications arise.)

175
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,320
- Look!
- See these?

176
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,800
These are all fine stuff.

177
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,480
Mother,

178
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,440
look!

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
The fabric,

180
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,360
and the embroidery...

181
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
So exquisite.

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,360
Indeed.

183
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Father, Mother,

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
don't you think

185
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,040
if I dress like her,

186
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,280
people wouldn't tell us apart?

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,560
Well...

188
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Father,

189
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
haven't you always said

190
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,640
had Master Xian met me first,

191
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
I'd be the Princess Consort now?

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,480
I think Qing's no less than her.

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Yes,

194
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,840
exactly.

195
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Your Highness.

196
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,640
Your Highness?

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
You fool!

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,480
You fool!

199
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
You fool!

200
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,600
You fool!

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,480
How dare you seduce His Highness!

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,520
You fool!

203
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
How dare you seduce His Highness!

204
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,480
You fool!

205
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
What are you

206
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,240
doing?

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,968
I...

208
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,040
What are you doing?

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
Your Highness, save me!

210
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,520
She hit me!

211
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,928
- I don't know what I did wrong.
- What's all this?

212
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,160
What's going on here?

213
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,680
Do you know

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,320
that framing someone to death

215
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
makes accomplice and instigator
equally guilty.

216
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Both must die.

217
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,040
She was trying to silence me!

218
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,720
I didn't!

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
Silence her?

220
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:20,692
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

221
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:26,353
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪

222
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:34,900
