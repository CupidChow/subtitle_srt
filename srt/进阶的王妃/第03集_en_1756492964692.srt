1
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,385
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,309
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,480
(In Memory of Prince Rui, Xiao Xingyan)
Your Highness,

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,920
how could you leave me like this?

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,600
Your Highness...

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,720
Your Highness.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,920
One lifetime, one destined pair.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll follow you into the afterlife.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
Why is she here?

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
(Prince Rui's Concubine, Concubine Dou)
She wears the mourning of a son's wife.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,640
Such overstepping!

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,720
How audacious!

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,200
The Prince Xian's in the palace,
and no one backs her now.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Yet she grows even bolder.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,160
A lowly creature like you

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,000
isn't worthy to mourn His Highness.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,280
You defile this memorial hall.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,760
My lady.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,560
What status do you have

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,280
to strike me
before His Highness' spirit?

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,440
So you want to debate status with me?

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,080
Then let's examine this thoroughly.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,840
And what exactly is your status?

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
A mere concubine,

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,800
even favored,
still registered as a servant.

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,240
While I

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,240
am the rightful wife-to-be
of the mansion's heir,

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
which makes me

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,080
your future master.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,400
In this grand mansion,

31
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,840
how can we lack someone
to manage affairs?

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Though unworthy of the position,

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,680
given the current disorder,

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,480
I must reluctantly
assume responsibility.

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,920
Quite lofty ambitions you have.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,920
Your Highness.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,360
Greetings, Your Highness.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
Your Highness,

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,360
you've finally arrived!

40
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:56,263
(Prince Rui's Younger Sister,
Princess Ruihua)

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Xiao Xian

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,080
was always the most mischievous
among his peers.

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,280
His escapades among the common folk

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,920
should be laughed off by elders like us.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,920
Who would take them seriously?

47
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,080
Your Highness,

48
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,720
Prince Xian's words

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,080
shouldn't be taken at face value.

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,760
Then what about Prince Rui's words?

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,920
Should those be dismissed too?

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
His Highness?

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
Before his passing, he promised

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
to bless my marriage with Prince Xian.

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
Impossible.

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Your Highness,

57
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,680
she's clearly fabricating this.

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Who witnessed this?

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,000
- No.
- No.

60
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,520
I hear nothing.

61
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,760
I have a witness.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,520
Well...

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,080
This is the musician

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,160
who attended His Highness
during his final illness.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
I can testify

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
Prince Rui did verbally consent

67
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
to this marriage arrangement.

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Your Highness,

69
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,440
this shameless woman must have bribed

70
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,600
this false witness.

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,600
Confess!

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
How much did she pay you?

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,160
Your Highness,

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,640
let's have them bound and beaten.

75
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,240
Feicui,

76
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,840
hurry.

77
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,440
Enough.

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I've been informed

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,680
His Highness suffered
during his illness,

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,520
restless through endless nights.

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Your music brought him moments of peace.

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,520
As a benefactor to this household,

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,880
you deserve our utmost courtesy.

84
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,480
- Your Highness...
- Regarding His Highness' final words,

85
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,160
I will personally investigate.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,160
How curious our acquaintance began.

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,600
His Highness fell gravely ill.

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
To ease his suffering,

89
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
I sought every musician in the capital.

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,280
Never imagined I'd find you.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,240
Why do you look so troubled

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
and are always clutching your wrist?

93
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,520
Could it be you're thinking

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
of a secret lover?

95
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,360
Don't talk nonsense!

96
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,640
Then show me your wrist.

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,200
No.

98
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,280
Go on talking nonsense.

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,160
Let me see it.

100
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,240
What have you truly endured?

101
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,680
Remember this.

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,560
There is no more Lin Hong'er
in this world.

103
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,840
Only Prince Rui's musician,

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Hong...

105
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Lin..

106
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,000
lang.

107
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,120
I got it.

108
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
I was once humiliated by enemies.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,120
The past

110
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,440
is too painful to recall.

111
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,828
(Three days later)

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,640
What does the Princess Consort
want me here for?

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,880
Ziyi,

114
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,320
actually, I have a favor to ask.

115
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,360
Go ahead.

116
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,280
Why stand on ceremony with me?

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,400
Have you forgotten we're sworn sisters?

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,920
My enemy

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,720
is still relentlessly pursuing me.

120
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
Yesterday, when I left the mansion,
I saw him again.

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,080
Well...

122
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,640
Could he be secretly
watching me all this time?

123
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,040
Linlang,

124
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
(Prince Rui's Mansion)
this is Prince Rui's Mansion.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,560
What's there to fear in broad daylight?

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
He's

127
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,480
a lustful scoundrel.

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,320
Listen to me, Linlang.

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
This can be easily handled.

130
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
Just arrange to meet him.

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Pretend to be weak and vulnerable.

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,880
He'll become even more reckless.

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,960
When the time comes,

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,440
I'll take care of him for you.

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,240
Thank you.

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,120
My lady,

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,680
did you leave your package
in the carriage?

138
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll go retrieve it now.

139
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
My lady, I don't understand.

140
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
You haven't known her long.

141
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,840
Why treat her so kindly?

142
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
When His Highness was gravely ill,

143
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
she constantly played music by his side.

144
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
My kindness to her

145
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,320
stems from her usefulness.

146
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,080
This favor requires minimal effort.

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
But compared to what she can return,

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,800
I still profit.

149
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,280
Qi,

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,280
let's go.

151
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,720
We're at the mansion.

152
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,880
That letter must be a trap.

153
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,120
Go back first.

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
I...

155
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Hurry!

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,720
You must be Mr. Sun.

157
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,560
And you are?

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
I wrote the letter.

159
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,640
I heard your cleverness

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,720
managed to extract information
from Lin Hong'er.

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,880
You've been most helpful to Lady Xu.

162
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,280
As you know,

163
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,240
she always repays kindness.

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,640
It's just her current position
in the mansion complicates things.

165
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,200
It would be my honor to serve

166
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,040
Her Highness.

167
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,080
Truly an honor.

168
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Lady Xu holds you in high regard.

169
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,280
I merely possess modest talents.

170
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,200
Modest talents.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,400
If you truly wish to serve,

172
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,080
meet at the mansion tonight.

173
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,280
The mansion?

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,720
If you're not willing,

175
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
just forget it.

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,200
I am.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,600
I am.

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
Is everything
going well with you, Linlang?

179
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
You were right.

180
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
My show of weakness

181
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,440
indeed lowers his guard.

182
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,840
I've lured him to meet me
at my place tonight.

183
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,680
Now I await your assistance.

184
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Rest assured.

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,960
I'll fulfill my duty.

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,480
Tonight, I plan to

187
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,800
lure him to a secluded spot first.

188
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
Xu Ziyi has indeed colluded

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
with this musician.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,600
Liuyun,

191
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,560
today's affair must remain undiscovered.

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
You've finally come.

193
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Close the doors.

194
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
How foolish.

195
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,560
You and Lady Xu alone together

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
in the dead of night.

197
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,840
What if someone sees you?

198
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,560
No.

199
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,720
Sh-She said to come here.

200
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,040
The mansion isn't safe.

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,680
We found another place.

202
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,040
Lady Xu awaits you there.

203
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,160
Go!

204
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:58,737
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

205
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:04,398
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪

206
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:12,945
♪When spring comes, I see the truth♪

207
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:19,044
♪We've changed through the years♪

208
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:25,713
♪Cold lamps reflect pear blossom dew♪

209
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:33,393
♪Worlds change as streams run west♪

210
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:40,419
♪Rains veil hills, gathering sorrows♪

211
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:46,577
♪In deep courtyards, hands drift apart♪
