00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:10,406
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,330
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,240
Lady Hong,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,080
would you like to take this chance
to return home with me?

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,760
Her health might not
endure long journeys.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,720
It's fine.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,280
Lai County isn't far.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,120
We'll arrive within days.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,960
My homesickness grows strong.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,440
This coincides with Lady Xu's journey.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,560
I beg your approval.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,480
Very well.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,680
I'll arrange more attendants

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,960
to care for you.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,928
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

16
00:00:54,112 --> 00:01:00,384
(Xu Residence)

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,240
Father.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,000
Mother.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,560
Father.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,280
Mother.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,080
Good.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,160
You've grown thinner.

23
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,000
We've waited

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
for this day for so long.

25
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,880
You've finally come home.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,520
- Let me look at you properly.
- Father. Mother.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,160
This is my friend from the mansion,

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,080
Lady Hong.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,976
Greetings, Lady Hong.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,360
Master Xu,

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,080
we meet at last.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,400
Linlang,

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,000
this is Lord He, the Magistrate.

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,480
Hello, Lady Hong.

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I heard you're hunting a fugitive?

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,800
You mean the one who faked her death?

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,400
We've set an inescapable trap.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,720
She'll be captured soon.

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,920
I see.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,960
Lady Hong,

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,440
the journey must be tiring.

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,160
Get inside now.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Rest awhile.

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,960
You truly foresaw everything.

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,120
She will soon reveal her flaws.

46
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Now that she's returned to Lai County,

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
she'll surely go to plot
with Lin Hong'er.

48
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,240
Then we'll capture them all at once.

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Understood.

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,840
Wait. It's not clean yet.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,080
This? This is valuable.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,640
Go now!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,560
Young lady,

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,200
looking for someone?

55
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,240
Is your hometown here?

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
You're so beautiful.

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,640
Listen.

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,880
Stay away from this house.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,960
Murder happened there.

60
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,720
A haunted house.

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,440
Exactly.

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,840
That Lin Hong'er

63
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,320
brought shame to the entire village.

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
That ungrateful girl

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,080
killed her own parents.

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,680
A murderous demon.

67
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
That evil creature.

68
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,440
If we see her,

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,560
we'll send her to the court.

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,280
- That's right.
- That's right.

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
- To the court.
- To the court.

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,560
She deserves death.

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
(I'll lure Xu Ziyi out)

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,920
(and have villagers identify)

75
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,640
(the imposter posing as Lin Hong'er.)

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Send her into prison!

77
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
Such kind elderly folks.

78
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,304
Young lady,

79
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
what's wrong?

80
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm fine.

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,680
I just heard rumors

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,840
that someone saw her.

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Really?

84
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,720
Young lady, want some vegetables?

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
- Let me see.
- Come take a look.

86
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
Take your time.

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,280
All premium quality. Look.

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,440
Your wisdom prevails.

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
She must be meeting Lin Hong'er.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
She'll flee!

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,200
Let's go.

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,040
Go!

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
- Get in!
- Get in!

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
My lord,

95
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,920
what's happening?

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Where's the woman?

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,040
She went that way.

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,360
After her!

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
- Let's go!
- Chase her! Move!

100
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,080
Out of the way!

101
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,920
Seize her!

102
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Go!

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,248
Where is she?

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
What's going on, my dear?

105
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,880
Who knows?

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,920
I-Is that the murderer

107
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,520
L-Lin...

108
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,280
There! Go! After her!

109
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,120
I heard Lin Hong'er returned
a few days ago.

110
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
Didn't expect it to be true.

111
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,048
Isn't that Lin Hong'er
who killed her parents?

112
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
She came back?

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,720
Stop!

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,760
- My lord, slow down.
- Don't run!

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Are you okay?

116
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,480
After her!

117
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Let's go.

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,200
My lord,

119
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,800
does she have some ulterior motive?

120
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
She's playing me.

121
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,240
Water...

122
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:50,680
My lord.

123
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Bad news.

124
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Lady Xu is missing.

125
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
Lin Hong'er wants revenge on Lady Xu.

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,360
If Lady Xu's missing,

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,080
I'm finished.

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,920
Don't just stand there.

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,600
Go find her.

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,632
Why are you waiting?

131
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,160
If you fail, we'll die!

132
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,288
Don't return without her!

133
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:10,720
Looks like Lin Hong'er.

134
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
She's Lin Hong'er, right?

135
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,280
My dear,

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,080
it's really her.

137
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,000
She's that

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Lin Hong'er?

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
Lin Hong'er?

140
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,720
- It's truly her.
- That's definitely her!

141
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,360
Why is she here?

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
Wasn't she dead?

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
How dare she return in broad daylight.

144
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,720
She even killed her parents.

145
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
She deserves death!

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,640
- Murderer!
- Murderer!

147
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,120
I'm not Lin Hong'er.

148
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Beast!

149
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
Your mother...

150
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,840
I grew up with her since childhood.

151
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,920
I watched her get married.

152
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
We gave birth on the same day.

153
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,160
We nursed our babies together.

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,760
What a kind soul she was!

155
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
Monster!

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
You fiend!

157
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,832
You vile creature!

158
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:13,800
Worse than an animal!

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm not Lin Hong'er!

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,200
You are Lin Hong'er!

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,200
You beast!

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Brute!

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,280
You vile creature!

164
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,400
Everyone, stop!

165
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,960
Stop!

166
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,360
- Stop!
- Move aside!

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,760
Make way!

168
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
What are you doing?

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,680
Save me.

170
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,680
Kill them all.

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
Kill them all!

172
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,600
You're such a heartless villain.

173
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,160
Who are you?

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Guards!

175
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,800
Yes, my lord.

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,000
Imprison Lin Hong'er.

177
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Understood.

178
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
- Wonderful!
- Lock her up!

179
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm not Lin Hong'er.

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,440
Move!

181
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,560
Let go of me!

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
It's over.

183
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,080
It's over.

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,240
It's over.

185
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
It's all over.

186
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,080
Lin Hong'er must have captured Lady Xu.

187
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,120
It's over!

188
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,720
My lord.

189
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,280
My lord.

190
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,800
My lord,

191
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
great news!

192
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
What great news?

193
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,080
Are you mocking me?

194
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,920
No!

195
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,320
My lord,

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
Lin Hong'er has been captured.

197
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,200
Really?

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,640
Without doubt.

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,560
Someone just reported

200
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
that he's seen Lin Hong'er.

201
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,560
The Registrar personally led the team.

202
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,840
Lin Hong'er

203
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,800
is utterly wicked

204
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,960
and infamous.

205
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,600
This time, the Registrar
caught her red-handed.

206
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
The people are cheering in approval.

207
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,400
They're even hailing you as wise.

208
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,680
Of course!

209
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,800
Though the Registrar made the arrest,

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,720
it was my planning that enabled it.

211
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,440
Absolutely.

212
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,440
Let's go.

213
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,160
Lead the way.

214
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,120
My lord, please.

215
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Han,

216
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
you arrested Lin Hong'er...

217
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,720
My lord.

218
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
Why are you here?

219
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,800
I heard Lin Hong'er was captured,

220
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
so I came specifically

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
to testify against her crimes.

222
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,200
Good.

223
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,800
A wise person knows when to yield.

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
Your decision to turn over a new leaf

225
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,560
brings me great relief.

226
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,240
My lord,

227
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
she claims to be close with Lin Hong'er.

228
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Are her words

229
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,080
credible?

230
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Of course.

231
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,200
I oversaw this case.

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,200
As the presiding official,

233
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,920
how could I not know?

234
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,160
Come with me.

235
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
I've finally caught you.

236
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
You...

237
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,840
You've colluded together.

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
Are you Lin Hong'er or Lady Xu?

239
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,800
Ugh!

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
He Laijin,

241
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,160
you traitorous creature.

242
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,400
Yes!

243
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
It's just this glare.

244
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,160
Y-You're Lady Xu?

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
H-How did this happen?

246
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
Wrong arrest!

247
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
My lord, you're mistaken.

248
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,280
She...

249
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,240
She was denounced
by all the Lin family's neighbors

250
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,320
and testified against by me,
her former accomplice.

251
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,040
She...

252
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,040
She's unquestionably

253
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,120
the heinous criminal

254
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,080
who killed her own parents.

255
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,720
She's not!

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,320
My lord.

257
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
Everyone, out!

258
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll interrogate her myself.

259
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,880
Leave!

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,480
My lord.

261
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,480
What now?

262
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,480
My lord,

263
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,640
someone is beating the drum.

264
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,040
Han,

265
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
handle this.

266
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,040
- Understood.
- My lord,

267
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
they are victims of the Lin family case.

268
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,160
They said there was a grave injustice.

269
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Make way!

270
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,936
The Perfect's here.

271
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,440
Bring the petitioners to the hall.

272
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,880
Understood.

273
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,720
My lord.

274
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,920
My lord,

275
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,760
I'm innocent!

276
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,040
- My lord.
- My lord,

277
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,360
Lin Hong'er is innocent.

278
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,800
She didn't kill her parents!

279
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
The money is for you both.

280
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,600
Can I give her some water?

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,040
The mansion's wedding procession
is already on route.

282
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,160
It'll arrive tomorrow.

283
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,600
Should I inform Xiao Xian

284
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,320
to take a different route

285
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,800
and pick you up from prison?

286
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,360
You...

287
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,440
Aren't you trying to steal her life?

288
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,520
This is the reality

289
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
she actually endured.

290
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,080
(The trial is ongoing.)

291
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,720
(Why did Master Xu send someone here?)

292
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,360
You serve Master Xu's?

293
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,080
That's great!

294
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,640
What should I do
about Lady Xu's situation?

295
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,200
Didn't I already fetch someone

296
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,480
to resolve this?

297
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Someone?

298
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
Those two from the Luo family?

299
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,760
The Luos were bribed by Master Xu.

300
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
You know this well.

301
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,000
Exactly.

302
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,040
But their theatrics today

303
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,000
makes it more confusing to me.

304
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
I suspended the trial

305
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
and came over right away.

306
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,920
Are you saying these were arranged
by Master Xu?

307
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,680
Now the whole city knows
Lin Hong'er is alive.

308
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,320
And Lady Xu was taken away

309
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,160
in broad daylight.

310
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Do you intend to

311
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,320
publicly reveal the secret

312
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,320
that Lady Xu and Lin Hong'er
look identical?

313
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,880
To put it bluntly,

314
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
do you want to thoroughly investigate

315
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,040
every single matter?

316
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,280
Of course not.

317
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,080
Absolutely not.

318
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,000
So

319
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,840
only Lin Hong'er
can be the one arrested.

320
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,760
There's

321
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
only one way to save her.

322
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Reopen the case.

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,080
But to reopen the case,

324
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
we need a culprit.

325
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,880
I've already prepared
the culprit for you.

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
The Luo family's testimony

327
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,040
will explain everything clearly.

328
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,480
Very well.

329
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,720
I see.

330
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll overturn Lin Hong'er's verdict now.

331
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
A toast with tea instead of wine.

332
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,200
Thank you for granting me
this brilliant strategy.

333
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,280
I'll overturn it immediately.
