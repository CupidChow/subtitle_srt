00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:10,400
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,324
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Lady Qing, why are your hands

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,800
trembling so badly?

5
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:22,760
You...

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,080
What did you mean?

7
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:28,736
You...

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,200
You already know?

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,880
How could you possibly know?

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
My relationship with Lady Xu...

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,960
Can't you see it?

12
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:40,800
Did she

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,360
tell you?

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,880
The task you've entrusted to her...

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,840
She'll work hard to fulfill it.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,920
But with Prince Xian by her side,

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,720
she can't contact you.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,960
If there's anything you need to discuss,

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
you can just speak to me.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
For some reason,

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,400
I feel you've changed a lot.

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I got this feeling

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,480
from our very first meeting

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
in the capital.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,160
Tell me.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,840
Was it the imposing aura here
that frightened you?

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
Or did the nanny teach you decorum

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,560
that suppressed your nature?

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,320
Or perhaps...

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,960
Are your hands alright?

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,800
A man who's changed his heart,

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,040
blaming others

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
instead of himself...

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,040
You say I've changed?

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,960
Yes, I've changed.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
I've faced all the intrigues alone.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,720
Your unpredictability

38
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
and wavering affections...

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,000
I've seen it all clearly.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,040
But you?

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,640
You still expect me

42
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,040
to remain kind

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,080
and naive?

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't do that anymore.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,040
Ziyi.

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,720
Ziyi.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,400
Ziyi!

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Let me go.

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,160
After all,

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,000
you've already grown tired of me.

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,048
No.

53
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,440
No.

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
I've never grown tired of you.

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Xian,

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
I-I feel terrible.

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,600
I-I don't want to be a wandering spirit.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
I want to be your wife.

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,200
You are my...

60
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Xian.

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,440
You are my wife.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,920
You will get better.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,680
When you're better,

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
we'll marry immediately.

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,480
Alright?

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,416
Ziyi.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,760
Ziyi?

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,120
Ziyi!

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,360
The physician is here.

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,040
My lady.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Uncle Luo's family has come
to the mansion.

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
The ill come,

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,840
and the kind stay away.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,560
Write a secret letter to my father.

75
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,880
Tell him to find someone trustworthy

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
to assist me here.

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,280
Please dismiss the others.

78
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
So I can properly examine Lady Xu.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Leave us.

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,760
Lady Xu,

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,400
I am the one your father sent
to assist you.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Liuyun, close the doors and windows.

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
You're quite practiced at this routine.

84
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,680
Keep it down.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
Do you want people to know?

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,920
Don't you dislike seeing outsiders?

87
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Now you enter the mansion so brazenly.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
Not afraid of danger?

89
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
I have my own business here.

90
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,480
It's not entirely for your sake.

91
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
Then what is it for?

92
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,280
My reasons are none of your concern.

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
Just focus on protecting yourself.

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,880
Liuyun,

95
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,200
Master never speaks of his past.

96
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
His name and identity

97
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
are all fake.

98
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,720
He distrusts everyone.

99
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
He refuses to spend more time
than necessary with others.

100
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,280
How does he know such details

101
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,680
about the mansion?

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
Prince Rui is aged without heirs.

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,000
He has a sister titled Princess Ruihua

104
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,240
and a brother born of a concubine,

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,960
who is Xiao Xian's father.

106
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
Xiao Xian is the only male
of Prince Rui's line.

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,840
He's the rightful heir.

108
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
But Princess Ruihua
and Xiao Xian's father

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,640
are deeply at odds.

110
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,200
She despises Xiao Xian's
questionable parentage

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
and impure bloodline.

112
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,960
She keeps blocking his succession.

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,840
Maybe you can exploit this.

114
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:05,824
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,384
The physician is here.

116
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,440
I'll take my leave.

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,920
My lady.

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,848
Where's the letter?

119
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,920
Burned.

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,720
Then how can I trust you?

121
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,640
You're surrounded by enemies now.

122
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,120
If this letter fell into others' hands,

123
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
it would endanger you gravely.

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
I've memorized the letter's contents.

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Tell me.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,640
Rather than nurture future trouble,

127
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,440
we should eliminate the root cause.

128
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,320
Got it.

129
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,000
You may leave.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,120
He handles situations calmly.

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Why would he remain subordinate
to my father?

132
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
My lady,

133
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,160
you don't trust him?

134
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
I don't know.

135
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
Let's test him for now.

136
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,560
What are you doing here, Your Highness?

137
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,200
Have we met somewhere before?

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,360
Your Highness,

139
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
you must be mistaken.

140
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,880
Let me refresh your memory.

141
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,520
Right here, perhaps.

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
In the dead of night,

143
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,520
you met privately

144
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,200
with a woman from the mansion.

145
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,360
Are you referring to Lady Xu?

146
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,360
Certainly not.

147
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,600
Lady Xu is your fiancée.

148
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,920
Now her life hangs by a thread,

149
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
yet you detain me, a physician.

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
I thought you cared for her.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
Turns out your concern lies elsewhere.

152
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
I just want to advise you.

153
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,120
Now you live here as a physician.

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,800
Maintain proper boundaries

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,280
and abandon improper notions.

156
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,440
Your Highness,

157
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,560
aren't these words really for yourself?

158
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,920
I'm the secret lover.

159
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,920
What about you?

160
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,400
You're her junior,

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
bound by propriety to bow and greet her.

162
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,120
What filthy thoughts hide in your heart?

163
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
What are you two discussing

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,920
so intimately?

165
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I'm new here.

166
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,480
I was seeking Prince Xian's guidance
on the rules here.

167
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,288
Move.

168
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,184
You...

169
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
What's this?

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,880
I'm preparing a grand gift
for my uncle's family.

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,240
It seems

172
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,680
their turn has come.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,120
All-All these jewels are for me?

174
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,440
Lady Hone, you're really generous.

175
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,960
Even if I wanted to be generous,

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,880
I lack such wealth.

177
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,360
You mean they're from Lady Xu?

178
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,920
But we clashed so fiercely that day.

179
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
And I heard she was injured.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Why would she send me jewels?

181
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
I don't understand.

182
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,800
Lady Qing, you're clever.

183
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,520
Must I spell everything out?

184
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,400
You hold her fatal secret.

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,880
So she fears to cross you

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
and must grant all your requests.
