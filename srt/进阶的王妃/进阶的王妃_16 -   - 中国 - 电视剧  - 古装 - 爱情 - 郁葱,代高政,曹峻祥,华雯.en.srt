00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:10,406
=The Queen of Attack=

2
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:13,330
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,432
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,280
As long as Hong Linlang is inside,

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,880
eliminate her quietly.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,040
- Understood.
- Understood.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,640
Follow me.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,600
Is she inside?

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,160
Don't come in.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,000
Fall back.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,120
Everyone, fall back!

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,240
- Okay.
- Hurry, go!

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,040
Let's go now!

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,440
Go.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,600
Why are you here?

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,480
Come out.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,600
I saw everything.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,720
You rushed me over here

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,800
just for this?

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
If you help me,

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,280
I'll live.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,560
If you don't,

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
I'll die.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,800
My life is in your hands.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,640
You...

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,480
You two...

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Good...

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,720
Perfect.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,560
A bandit was shot.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Witnesses claimed

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,400
she resembled Hong Linlang closely.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,520
I need to check if she has...

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,520
Your Highness,

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,080
do I bear any wounds?

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Seems you didn't inspect thoroughly.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,560
Perhaps you should examine closer.

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,440
Lady Xu, don't leave.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
Once His Highness confirms,

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
he'll inform you himself.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,680
Enough!

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,400
No examining?

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,880
No.

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Why aren't you leaving then?

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
You have other business here?

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,920
At this point,

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,160
let's stop pretending.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,840
Some things

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,760
are easier

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,120
without love involved.

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Within three days,

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
propose to me.

52
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,600
Impossible.

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
I came to the mansion

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
for my own purpose.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,800
I'll marry Xiao Xian

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,160
and climb the social ladder.

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,520
Lady Hong,

58
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,400
you came here

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
with your own purpose too, right?

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Of course.

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,480
Good.

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,440
Very good.

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
If I shout now,

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
your scandal will be exposed,

65
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,280
ruining all your plans.

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,960
Let's cooperate instead.

67
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,880
Indeed.

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
Our ambitions

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,960
aren't worth sacrificing over a man.

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,160
So Lady Hong,

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
convincing him to marry me

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,720
is your task.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
After all,

74
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,480
you're his elder.

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,640
Nice working with you.

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,480
Nice working with you too.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,720
My lady,

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Hong Linlang

79
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
(I have something...)
colluded with the fake master's men

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
to abduct the Luos.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Do you think

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,840
she knows our secret?

83
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,960
I used to think

84
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,880
she approached me to enter the mansion

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
and get close to Prince Rui,

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,920
seeking advancement.

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
But now it seems

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
her every move

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,360
targets those who framed Lin Hong'er.

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,560
She might be Lin Hong'er's acquaintance.

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,520
How will you cooperate with her now?

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
Cooperate?

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
This isn't cooperation.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
It's a transaction.

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,840
I saw her disheveled

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
in bed with Xiao Xian.

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
It was such a juicy scene.

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,360
I had to play along.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,520
What's your next move?

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,920
Since we're fighting,

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,720
let's make it spectacular.

102
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:49,952
(To be opened by He Laijin)

103
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,120
You can still feel pain?

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm just heartless.

105
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,120
I still have feelings.

106
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,680
You...

107
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
You will marry her, right?

108
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,160
I once believed

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
she was the only one I wanted to marry.

110
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,600
But later...

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,584
My heart became conflicted.

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Since I came to save you tonight,

113
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
I'm determined to betray her.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,440
I won't delay her life.

115
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,360
But if you don't marry her,

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,120
she'll tell the County Princess
about what happened today.

117
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm carrying Prince Rui's child.

118
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
And you're his own nephew.

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,320
If the County Princess finds out

120
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,840
this scandalous incestuous affair,

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
she'll have me killed.

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,680
You...

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
Since you know this,

124
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,360
why did you get me here?

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
This is also a scheme.

126
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
Why?

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
I risked my reputation to call you here.

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,400
I hold secrets unknown to you,

129
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,320
and hatred you can't comprehend.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,800
I must become the true master
of the mansion.

131
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,400
So you can't have feelings for me.

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,040
And please don't
hold me back any longer.

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,760
If today's matter gets exposed,

134
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,240
all my plans will be ruined halfway.

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
So...

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,680
Go marry the one you're supposed to.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,520
Fine.

138
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,360
Fine.

139
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
Fine!

140
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,168
(County Office)

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,680
My lord.

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,400
My lord,

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,200
your letter.

144
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
I'll take my leave.

145
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,256
(Confirm if Lin Hong'er is really dead.
From Xu Ziyi)

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,383
(Here rest Lin Sanjiang and his wife)

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,520
My lord,

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,440
no weeds here.

149
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,760
Someone must've cleared it.

150
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,400
Hey, there,

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,040
come.

152
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,880
My lord.

153
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,240
Let me ask you.

154
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,080
Have you seen anyone
coming here to pay respects?

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
You mean that young lady?

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Young lady?

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,280
Yes,

158
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,680
pitiful soul.

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
You know her?

160
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,040
Her parents must've died horribly.

161
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
You're saying

162
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,000
the person mourning here
is their daughter?

163
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,760
Exactly.

164
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
She comes daily, weeping endlessly.

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
Mumbling about her parents' cruel death

166
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,040
and swearing revenge.

167
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,760
She claims corrupt officials
killed them.

168
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
Move along.

169
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,760
Could it be that Lin Hong'er

170
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
is still alive?

171
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Master Shentu?

172
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,520
Master Shentu,

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,320
why are you here?

174
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
I was about to send word to Lady Hong.

175
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
He Laijin visited the tomb.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm already aware.

177
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,240
Lady Hong laid this trap for long.

178
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,680
That fool He Laijin

179
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,400
will finally be caught.

180
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
My lady,

181
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,400
the letter.

182
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:54,336
(She is still alive.)

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
What?

184
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
Lin Hong'er is still alive?

185
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,720
What?

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,400
We must find Lin Hong'er.

187
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,680
Don't let her show herself.

188
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,280
Or she'll destroy everything I've built.

189
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,840
Hong Linlang...

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,960
She's Lin Hong'er's accomplice.

191
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Xian came to see me this morning.

192
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
We spoke at length

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,840
about your marriage.

194
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,400
Let's settle it this way.

195
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

196
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,040
If that's decided,

197
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I wish to return to Lai County first

198
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,000
to inform my parents.

199
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
That's proper.

200
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Lady Hong, you're also
from Lai County, right?

201
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Yes.

202
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Have you heard?

203
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,120
A major incident
occurred there recently.

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,480
A female convict
sentenced to death last year

205
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
faked her death and escaped.

206
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,520
A death row inmate
faked death and escaped?

207
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
Truly unprecedented.

208
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,520
Fortunately, Magistrate of Lai County
has new leads.

209
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,160
She will be apprehended soon.

210
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,040
Lady Hong,

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,000
it's been years since you last returned.

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,640
You must miss our hometown dearly.

213
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,160
Would you like to take this chance
to return home with me?
