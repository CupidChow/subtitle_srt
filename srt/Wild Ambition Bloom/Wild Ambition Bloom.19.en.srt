Why?

190
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,250
Because you are a rule-abiding person,

191
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,580
too honest and principled.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,770
But Wen Zhiqiu is not like that.

193
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,250
Just because he is not like you,

194
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,650
we can use him

195
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,300
to deal with Mr. Tian.

196
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,220
And the more I give him now,

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,820
the more he will return to me

198
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,530
in the future.

199

204

It matches the Western Bunao Pill.

205

207

We are in a different league.

If he considers us as opponents,

212
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,530
it means we win.

213

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,140
are not united as one.

568
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,780
Look, they got scared away!

569
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,300
We're doing business.

570
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,540
Don't fight them to the death.

571
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,780
Since you want to deal with Mr. Tian,

572
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,300
you must fight for everything.

573
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,500
Only when you fight desperately

574
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,580
will he learn to fear us.

575
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,020
So he won't send people again

576
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,420
to block our path.

577
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:01,980
Understand?

578
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,300
This fight made him fear us?

579
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,180
What if they make a harder move?

580
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,700
He fears me, not us.

581
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,140
She's not some celebrity,

582
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,860
[Makeup Room]
yet she made us wait for her.

583
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,100
Stop complaining.

584
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:24,940
She'll soon

585
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,860
marry into the Tian family.

586
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,300
She is acting now

587
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,660
out of respect for our boss.

588
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,580
Have you read the latest newspapers?

589
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,260
What?

590
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,700
Mr. Tian never

591
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
intends to marry her.

592
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,740
All of this was directed by herself.

593
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,260
So that's the case.

594
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,180
Exactly.

595
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,020
Hello, Bingxin.

596
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,420
What's wrong, Bingxin?

597
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,860
Why are you getting uglier?

598
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,460
Right,

599
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,740
jealousy made you ugly.

600
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,380
Have you noticed

601
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,420
your hair is thinning out?

602
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,020
You should mind your own business.

603
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,660
You…

604
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,220
I can't believe that!

605
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Exactly.

606
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,900
Don't show off power to us.

607
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,740
Go marry Mr. Tian!

608
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,740
Then we'd respect her.

609
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,020
Today?

610
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,260
Yes. I heard from someone

611
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,060
that an elder from the Tian family
is celebrating her birthday today.

612
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,860
All members of the Tian clan,

613
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,820
including Tongdao and Tongxin,
will attend.

614
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,820
But I need to meet a friend today.

615
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,020
Just take one photo

616
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,140
and then you can go to him.

617
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,300
Photo?

618
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,460
What kind of photo?

619
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,180
A photo showing me close to the Tians.

620
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,980
That might be difficult.

621
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,900
I know how to do it.

622
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,860
Just capture it.

623
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,980
Bai,

624
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,740
do you really think

625
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,660
a single photo can help you?

626
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,740
But it could silence many people.

627
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,220
Even so,

628
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,660
is that really true?

629
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,460
It's fine.

630
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,580
I'll make it come true.

631
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:06,980
Alright.

632
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,700
Thanks.

633
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,260
I'll treat you to a movie later.

638
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,100
wish you a long life and good health.

639

You're looking healthier.

640
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,100
Hello.

641
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,100
Here you are.

642
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,740
Came to me several times.

643
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,020
When I seek cooperation,

644
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,180
foreign firms will be my first choice.

645
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,060
Mr. Mu.

646
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,940
Mr. Tian.

647
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,100
Welcome!

648
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,060
Didn't Mr. Jin come?

649
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,340
He planned to visit in person,

650
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,860
but something came up.

651
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,660
So he sent me instead
to extend birthday wishes.

652
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,700
You are his best disciple.

653
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,100
Your presence here

654
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,900
carries the same weight.

655
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,740
I suppose that lady is

656
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,900
celebrating her birthday today.

657
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,900
She's our family's Second Grandaunt.

658
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,260
I should go greet her.

659
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,900
Please.

I came to extend birthday wishes.

Wait a moment.

665
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,580
Don't you want me here?

666
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,140
That's not what I meant.

667

Then don't come to me anymore.

Among Mr. Qingtong's poems,
[*Pen name of Zhang Shizhao]

699
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,140
my favorite line is this.

700
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,380
"Age upon age,
storms have swept before my eyes."

701
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,340
"All who mattered now
drift with the eastern tide."

702
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,180
This line mirrors Su Dongpo's verse.

703
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,620
"Eastward surges the river,"

704
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,020
- "washing heroes clean."
- "Washing heroes clean."

705
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,260
They convey the same idea.

00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,380

708
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,780
"A world astir, stunned by ruined age."

709
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,780
"A lofty soul sustained
by feeble light."

710

with heroic spirit.

Is that gentleman

00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,020
a university professor?

713
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,340

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,060
What's up?

757
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,260
Making money.

758
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:39,940
Congratulations then.

759
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,140
Same as always,
two bowls of wonton, please.

760
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,180
Just a moment.

761
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
Originally,

762
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,740
we planned to sell 8,000 boxes

763
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,020
through 90 apothecaries.

764
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,820
Yet in just one month,

765
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,180
we've exceeded that target by far.

766
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,980
I believe within five years,

767
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,180
we can become Shanghai's top pharmacy.

768
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,900
What? You don't think so?

769
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,340
Of course, I do.

770
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,780
But I was hoping

771
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,540
that Chichun Apothecary would someday

772
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,060
become China's top pharmacy.

773
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,980
What was it again?

774
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,020
Chichun Apothecary.

775
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,780
What is it?

776
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,980
The apothecary founded

777
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,340
by my great-great-grandfather.

778
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,980
Your family used to run an apothecary?

779
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,620
Yes.

780
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,780
What about now?

781
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,420
It went bankrupt long ago.

782
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,620
What about the brand?

783
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,020
I suppose it's with Xia Yuan now.

784
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,940
Go buy it back.

785
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,220
You're overestimating me.

786
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,700
I'm not capable of that now.

787
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,460
Thank you.

788
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
This is on me.

789
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,540
You're so nice.

790
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,660
You're destined

791
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,820
to be China's top herbs dealer.

792
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,500
Thanks.

793
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,940
Sir, she's treating me today.

794
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,260
I want more pan-fried buns.

795
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:08,980
Coming right up.

796
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,620
Do you need vinegar?

797
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,140
No, thanks.

798
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,980
Mr. Wen, is she your girlfriend?

799
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,780
Yeah. Beautiful, isn't she?

800
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,100
Absolutely stunning.

801
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,460
Sir, you've got it wrong.

802
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,780
There's a misunderstanding.

803
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,940
I'm not his girlfriend.

804
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,620
Really?

805
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,260
But you two look perfect together.

806
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,180
I agree.

807
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,740
Aren't we perfect together?

808
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,180
We absolutely do,

809
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,460
like sisters.

810
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,300
You give off the vibe

811
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,460
of not being interested in girls.

812
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,980
I'm surprised that you noticed.

813
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,860
Oh, come on. Stop it.

814
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,020
Don't you think so?

815
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,100
You're only interested in making money.

816
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,780
Aren't you the same?

817
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,460
We're two of a kind.

818
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,380
Yes.

819
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,460
We are.

820
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,340
That's what

821
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,540
will make us Shanghai's top pharmacy.

822
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,220
Newspapers!

823
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,820
Oriental Bunao Pill…

824
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,940
I mean, China's top pharmacy.

825
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,020
Is accused of infringing
on the Western Bunao Pill.

826
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,500
Tian's Apothecary has sued
Wen's Pharmacy!

827
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,900
What did you say?

828
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,100
The Oriental Bunao Pill is accused
of infringing on the Western Bunao Pill.

829
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Tian's Apothecary has sued
Wen's Pharmacy!

830
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,500
[Law Firm]
Acting on behalf of Professor Claudy,

831
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,300
the inventor of brain supplement
from the US,

832
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,060
Tian's Apothecary has filed a lawsuit

833
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
demanding an immediate ban

834
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,540
on all market sales
of Oriental Bunao Pill.

835
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,660
It also requires Wen's Pharmacy

836
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,900
to compensate Tian's Apothecary

837
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,180
and Professor Claudy

838
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,260
200,000 silver dollars each.

839
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,940
What does it have to do

840
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,820
with Professor Claudy?

841
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,740
Did you use his portrait

842
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,780
in your flyers?

843
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,540
That was the printing house's fault.

844
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,700
And we immediately recalled
and destroyed them.

845
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,500
All of them?

846
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,940
Four went missing.

847
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,180
As far as I know,

848
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,020
Tian's Apothecary found two of them.

849
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,500
These two flyers

850
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,940
became their key evidence

851
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,260
to demand a ban on Oriental Bunao Pill

852
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,500
and the exorbitant compensation claim.

853
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,900
But here's the thing.

854
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,620
The printing house printed
the wrong flyers.

855
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,140
It has nothing to do with us.

856
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,020
However, you distributed them.

857
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,100
But with just two flyers,

858
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,100
are they determined to wipe out

859
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,020
Oriental Bunao Pill entirely?

860
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,980
That depends on how the lawsuit proceeds

861
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,460
and how the judge rules.

862
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,060
How long does such a lawsuit
usually take?

863
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,580
If it goes smoothly, in a few months.

864
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,860
If not, it's hard to predict.

865
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,620
Some drag on for years.

866
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,420
Mr. Wen.

867
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,780
Mr. Wen.

868
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,620
About those flyers,

869
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,820
it was my fault.

870
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,060
I'll take full responsibility.

871
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,940
Can you?

872
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,340
There must be a way out.

873
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,700
Alright, here's an idea.

874
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,620
Let me ask Mr. Tian

875
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,300
to take you as his concubine,

876
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,780
so you'll be his family.

877
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,780
Problem solved.

878
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,340
I don't like what you just said.

879
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,540
Wen's Pharmacy is in trouble,

880
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,540
and you rushed to handle it.

881
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,340
But as a manager,

882
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,980
you can't take the responsibility.

883
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,420
Or should I call you boss instead?

884
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,540
Thank you.

885
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,100
Shaohua,

886
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,140
what's going on?

887
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,820
Sun said

888
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,380
Tian's Apothecary sued Wen's Pharmacy

889
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,820
over some flyers.

890
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,460
Our Oriental Bunao Pill

891
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,340
outsells

892
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,100
their Western Bunao Pills.

893
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Mr. Tian

894
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,940
has tried many underhanded tactics,

895
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,860
but none have managed to suppress us.

896
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,980
So he used two misprinted flyers

897
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,940
to attack us.

898
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,740
Will you lose?

899
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,020
We're seeking reconciliation

900
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,100
and will meet him tomorrow
to discuss settlement terms.

901
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,460
However, he resorted

902
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,740
to violence to stop us before.

903
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,260
Now that he's finally got leverage,

904
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,660
he won't let us off easily this time.

905
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,020
Relax.

906
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,020
I'll go talk to him.

907
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,420
Just stay out of this.

908
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,340
Your matters are my concerns.

909
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,540
Don't you worry this might affect

910
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,140
your relationship with him?

911
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,340
Didn't you read the newspaper today?

912
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,020
What's up?

913
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,020
The Tian family has accepted me.

914
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,140
Mrs. Tian even invited me over

915
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,940
for afternoon tea at their place.

916
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,380
In that case,

917
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,860
you absolutely must not interfere.

918
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,060
Why?

919
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Just don't.

920
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,220
Shaohua.

921
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,940
Haven't eaten yet?

922
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,860
Come on. I'll treat you.

923
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,900
Alright then.

924
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,540
What do you think

925
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,940
the chance

926
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,300
of Wen's Pharmacy in winning?

927
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,460
According to Western legal precedents,

928
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,620
they have no chance.

929
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,940
However,

930
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,780
Tian's Apothecary demands

931
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,620
a complete ban on Oriental Bunao Pill

932
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,380
and 400,000 silver dollars
in compensation

933
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
from Wen's Pharmacy.

934
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,900
I don't think the court will agree.

935
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,300
But Wen's Pharmacy

936
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
will suffer heavy losses.

937
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,380
That's right.

938
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,100
Mr. Xia,

939
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,820
did you pay him 100,000 silver dollars?

940
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,300
I only paid 30,000 silver dollars.

941
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,780
That's good.

942
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,500
