00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,370
Understood.

193
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,010
Ma'am, please rest assured.

194
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,100
We will never fail you.

195
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,490
Ma'am,

196
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
do the Chens

197
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,700
and the Chus know about this plan?

198
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,730
Will they agree to it?

199
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,700
Huashun Apothecary was founded by me,

200
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,980
and how to deal with it
remains my sole decision.

201
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,340
I am confident this is

202
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,850
the optimal plan for both families.

203
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,060
Furthermore,

204
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,820
the present agreement

205
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,340
was penned by my own hand.

206
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,490
We shall make a copy at Anke Hall later

207
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,770
to avoid potential contentions.

208
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,010
Ma'am,

209
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,130
must you leave?

210
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,490
You built and maintained
Huashun Apothecary.

211
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,610
Can you bear to abandon it?

212
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,580
We

213
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,610
simply can't bear to see you go.

214
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,010
I hate to part with Huashun Apothecary

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,850
or any of you.

216
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,420
However,

217
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,530
I fear

218
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,700
if I don't go,

219
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,010
I might regret it
for the rest of my life.

220
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,060
Ma'am,

221
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,180
you are destined for great endeavors.

222
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,490
Allow us once more

223
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,250
to wish you and Miss Xuan

224
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,850
smooth travels ahead,

225
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,250
with boundless opportunities.

226
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,890
Very well.

227
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,060
Ma'am, rest assured.

228
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,730
We will collaborate unwaveringly

229
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,580
to propel Huashun Apothecary
to greater heights,

230
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,850
while treating the Chens and Chus well.

231
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,130
Then,

232
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,730
I shall entrust it to both of you.

233
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,770
Please come in.

234
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,490
Mrs. Wei, the man
from Shouyuan Apothecary is here.

235
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm Liang of Shouyuan Apothecary.
My respects, Mrs. Wei.

236
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,100
With more goods
to cross the mountain path,

237
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,420
you want Ertu to help?

238
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,220
No goods this time.

239
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,300
I've got some news

240
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,650
to inform Ertu.

241
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,250
What's it?

242
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,650
He's been searching

243
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,580
for a young couple these past few years.

244
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,420
I stumbled

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,940
upon their whereabouts.

246
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,940
Where are they?

247
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,770
The man is dead,

248
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,460
while the woman is still alive.

249
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,370
She even opened Huashun Apothecary
in the town.

250
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,980
Alright, I'll deliver the message.

251
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,820
Still feeding?

252
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,650
Shaozhong.

253
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,770
Mother.

254
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,850
Shaohua,

255
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,010
didn't expect to see you.

256
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,460
I made a special trip to see you.

257
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,130
Shaozhong, Shaohua is here.

258
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,340
Come talk with us!

259
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,650
Just act like I'm not home.

260
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,010
Mother, take a seat.

261
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,100
I've missed you.

262
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,770
Mother,

263
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,730
the reason I'm here this time

264
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,650
is to bid you all farewell.

265
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,010
I'm taking Xuan on a long journey.

266
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,220
Once we set off,

267
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,650
I'm not sure when we'll return.

268
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,420
What?

269
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,980
A long journey?

270
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:37,890
Exactly.

271
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
Where are you heading?

272
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,460
France.

273
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,730
France?

274
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,490
Abroad?

275
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,300
Yes.

276
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,250
Why are you going there?

277
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,980
You're taking Xuan there alone?

278
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,370
With a friend.

279
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,820
What sort of friend?

280
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,130
Reliable?

281
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,650
Absolutely.

282
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,730
Have you got enough traveling expenses?

283
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,010
Will the journey be safe?

284
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
That's another country.

285
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,770
Can you settle there?

286
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,610
Shaohua, don't be deceived!

287
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,060
Set your mind at ease.

288
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,060
Xuan and I will be safe

289
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,700
and sound in this journey.

290
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,060
Enough! Stop fretting.

291
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,010
She's been resourceful
since she was little.

292
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,060
She'll surely manage just fine.

293
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:24,650
Mother,

294
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,850
she's venturing awfully far this time.

295
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,650
Yeah. Your life is comfortable here.

296
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
Why do you insist on leaving?

297
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,340
I've longed to explore
beyond our borders.

298
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,250
Now fate's handed me this very chance.

299
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,130
But if you leave,

300
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,650
what about your family?

301
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,060
Precisely!

302
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,100
And

303
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,300
what about your apothecary?

304
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,980
After I leave,

305
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,650
Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang

306
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,980
will manage Huashun Apothecary.

307
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,940
Entrusted to two outsiders?

308
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,100
They're my founding partners,

309
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
hardly outsiders at all.

310
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,580
Even so,

311
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,530
they're not part of us.

312
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,820
Why not let me manage it?

313
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:06,730
Right?

314
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,580
Don't you

315
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,980
trust me?

316
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,610
That's not the reason.

317
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,850
Now they're handling so masterfully

318
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,940
everything in Huashun Apothecary.

319
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,700
If they're suddenly replaced,

320
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,010
I fear the business may be disrupted.

321
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,850
I don't think so.

322
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,300
The way Huashun Apothecary operates

323
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,770
is rather different from others.

324
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,890
What's the difference?

325
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,940
I ran an apothecary for decades.

326
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,530
Just about buying cheap
and selling dear.

327
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,940
Shaozhong, trust me on this.

328
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,460
I have my reason to do this.

329
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,010
And it's absolutely the safest play.

330
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,890
Anyway, you clearly don't trust me

331
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,850
and think I'll mess up your apothecary.

332
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,250
- No.
- I'm done talking.

333
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,010
Shaozhong.

334
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,130
Shaohua, you're leaving soon,

335
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,940
yet you refuse to let him take it over.

336
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,530
Aren't you going a little too far?

337
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,220
Mother,

338
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,610
he simply isn't made for business.

339
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,890
If I entrust Huashun Apothecary to him,

340
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,220
it'll end like Chichun Apothecary.

341
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,700
But…

342
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,130
Let's put an end to this.

343
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,010
I came here today

344
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,220
to tell you something important.

345
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,180
After I leave,

346
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,180
you and Dashun's mother will each
hold 40 percent

347
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,180
of the shares in Huashun Apothecary.

348
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,370
How much is that?

349
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,610
Let me explain.

350
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,980
Without disasters or misfortunes,

351
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,370
the annual dividends

352
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,940
can sustain your livelihood.

353
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,180
Even if Bao attends school,

354
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,490
it'll all be covered.

355
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,340
Great!

356
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,980
But you only have the dividends,

357
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,010
no rights of operating the apothecary,

358
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,460
or transferring of the shares.

359
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,180
What do you mean by this?

360
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
It means

361
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,180
you can safely keep this money.

362
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,460
In the future,

363
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,250
no need to worry about money.

364
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Alright, Mother.

365
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,940
I'm going back now.

366
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,010
In a few days,

367
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,850
we'll all go to Anke Hall together

368
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,300
to sign and stamp the papers.

369
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,250
This matter is settled.

370
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
No matter what,

371
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,530
you must be careful.

372
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,730
Rest assured.

373
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm leaving now, Mother.

374
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,340
Please take care.

375
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,180
Where? Let me see...

376
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,890
Mrs. Chen!

377
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,890
Found you!

378
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,770
Mrs. Chen!

379
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,300
- Oh, please!
- Mother.

380
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,420
You're in the mood for eating?

381
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,490
Ping, hug!

382
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,010
Hug!

383
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,370
Are you two stupid?

384
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,730
Just did whatever she said!

385
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,730
Why didn't you two fight for it?

386
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,220
What's the point of fighting?

387
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,290
She owns the entire apothecary.

388
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,980
She can handle it exactly as she likes!

389
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,140
On what grounds? You're her brother.

390
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,050
Do you think she still sees me

391
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,490
as her brother?

392
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,450
You're just a coward!

393
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,490
Mother,

394
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,330
you should help Shaozhong.

395
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,010
Don't let Shaohua do whatever she wants.

396
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't put it that way!

397
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,730
She doesn't let him
take over the apothecary,

398
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,490
but at least she gives the shares.

399
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,380
We only have 40 percent.

400
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Shaohua said

401
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,010
just 40 percent shares

402
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,010
are enough for our whole family

403
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,380
to live comfortably for a lifetime.

404
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,250
Mother, that's not how it works.

405
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,700
The apothecary belongs to Chu Shaohua.

406
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,620
She's the owner,

407
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,050
so it ought to be our Chu family's,

408
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,620
right?

409
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,010
It has nothing to do
with the Chen family.

410
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,290
Chen Dashun's dead.

411
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,140
Why can they claim our shares?

412
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,940
Forget it.

413
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,090
Just leave this matter as it is.

414
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,940
That won't work.

415
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,770
We have to get it back.

416
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,290
If you want it,

417
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,330
go ahead.

418
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,730
Chu Shaozhong, speak up!

419
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,530
As Mother said,

420
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,220
if you want it,

421
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,810
go ahead.

422
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,060
You coward!

423
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,900
Alright,

424
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,490
I'll go!

425
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,860
You won't survive without me!

426
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,090
Don't say such nonsense!

427
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,940
Is this really true?

428
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,330
What else did she say?

429
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,700
I passed by her door today

430
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,810
and heard

431
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,010
only these few sentences.

432
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,330
She's leaving,

433
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,180
and intends to transfer her shares

434
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,570
to Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang.

435
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,660
How can this be?

436
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,940
I told you, my dear,

437
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,220
to make up your mind sooner.

438
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,330
You didn't listen, right?

439
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,420
Now it's all gone.

440
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,730
Oh, no.

441
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,900
I'll hurry back to the apothecary.

442
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,330
Anyway, I've told you all I know.

443
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,860
The rest is up to you.

444
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,620
Hurry back!

445
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,660
But I…

446
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,250
What am I supposed to do?

447
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,570
I have no solution now.

448
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,330
I have no idea.

449
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,860
Then...

450
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,050
What to do?

451
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,530
[Huashun Apothecary]

452
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,620
Chu Shaohua.

453
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,700
Chu Shaohua,

454
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,700
how could you treat Shaozhong like this?

455
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,180
Go inside and talk.

456
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,380
Ma'am,

457
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,860
the overdue account
from Mr. Xie has been settled.

458
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,420
It totals 103 silver dollars.

459
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,140
Please verify.

460
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,420
Take a seat.

461
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,660
Right.

462
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,490
Okay.

463
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,250
Yan,

464
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,730
what have I done to Shaozhong?

465
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,330
You may not give him the apothecary,

466
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,460
but at least give him some shares!

467
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,530
Now look at you!

468
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,940
You won't leave him any shares

469
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,050
or let him manage the apothecary.

470
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,420
Don't you realize
how unreasonable this is?

471
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,460
So in your opinion,

472
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,140
how should I make the plan?

473
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,570
I think

474
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,140
you should give the Chen family nothing.

475
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,490
Have you ever considered this?

476
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,900
You built and maintained

477
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,420
the apothecary alone.

478
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,940
Does it have anything to do
with the Chen family?

479
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,660
You're right.

480
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,220
But according to your logic,

481
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,770
my apothecary

482
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,940
received no help from the Chus,

483
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,810
so I should give Chus no shares.

484
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,860
But you should show no partiality!

485
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,090
Both the Chen and Chu families

486
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,090
get 40 percent each.

487
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,770
Isn't that fair?

488
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,220
What about the remaining 20 percent?

489
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,140
They were meant for Mr. Wang,

490
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,620
Mr. Jiang, and all the clerks.

491
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,460
Even the clerks get shares?

492
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,380
Why?

493
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,810
Because after I leave,

494
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,290
they will take care of this apothecary!

495
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,220
If you give them no shares,

496
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,940
how can you expect them to work hard?

497
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,700
Frankly,

498
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,290
this is where you're failing!

499
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,010
You and Shaozhong are blood relatives,

500
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,330
both surnamed Chu.

501
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,900
Yet you give him no shares,

502
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,180
handing everything to outsiders.

503
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,900
You're betraying your own kin.

504
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,940
You must stand by your family.

505
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,180
Does that make sense?

506
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,530
I must stand by my family.

507
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,050
I've got an idea.

508
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:29,810
Go ahead.

509
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,050
I should set you aside.

510
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,460
What does that mean?

511
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,220
Look.

512
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,860
Although you married Shaozhong,

513
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,530
your surname is Zhou,

514
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,730
not Chu.

515
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,660
If Shaozhong divorces you,

516
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,290
this apothecary will fall to him.

517
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,090
As you said, the apothecary

518
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,770
must stay within the family.

519
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,530
Chu Shaohua,

520
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,530
you're making me sick, huh?

521
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,700
Don't like it?

522
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,220
I've got another solution.

523
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,700
I'll set this apothecary on fire

524
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,010
and burn it clean to the ground.

525
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,490
Then no one will covet it!

526
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,810
Fine then.

527
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,290
You're truly harsh!

528
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,090
If I hadn't been harsh,

529
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,570
you would have robbed

530
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,140
of me everything.

531
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,380
Zhou Yan, listen to me.

532
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm not part of the Chen family,

533
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,250
nor the Chu family.

534
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,380
I belong to myself.

535
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,290
If you want to gain something from me,

536
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,010
give up your greed now.

537
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,730
If you dare scheme against me again,

538
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,770
I promise you'll get nothing.

539
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,140
Believe it or not?

540
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:32,900
Alright.

541
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,700
You're ruthless enough.

542
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,620
I'm warning you.

543
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,220
You will regret this.

544
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,460
Ma'am,

545
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,460
at the risk of impertinence,

546
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,010
why would you give the shares
to your mother,

547
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,900
and not to your brother?

548
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,050
You just saw

549
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,530
what Yan is like.

550
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,980
As I give these shares to my mother,

551
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,530
Shaozhong will surely get what he wants.

552
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,530
If all the shares go to Shaozhong,

553
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,810
my mother won't get anything.

554
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,050
What does Abubu look like?

555
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,770
Xuan, I'm back!

556
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,810
Mother!

557
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,460
Shaohua.

558
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,140
Come on!

559
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,460
Did you take your medicine today?

560
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,530
I just chugged down a big bowl!

561
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,700
Good girl!

562
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,330
Did you eat properly today?

563
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,290
Miss Xuan,

564
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,220
I had meals on time all day.

565
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,900
Awesome mother!

566
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,050
Mother.

567
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,250
Song Ping,

568
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,420
take Xuan to play nearby.

569
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,860
I need a word alone with Shaohua.

570
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,620
Here.

571
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,490
Xuan, go with me.

572
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,330
I'll join you shortly.

573
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,570
Mother!

574
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,900
Darling,

575
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,050
Dashun,

576
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,620
[In Memory of My Father, Chen Xiankui]
[In Memory of My Husband, Chen Dashun]

577
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,700
may you bless our whole family
to stay united.

578
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,770
When we gather as one,

579
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,010
life feels a little easier.

580
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,090
Not one of us can leave.

581
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,180
Bless us, please!

582
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,490
If anyone tries
to tear this family apart,

583
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,810
I won't show her mercy.

584
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,620
Even you two down below

585
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,180
won't let her live in peace either.

586
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,380
Shaohua.

587
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,220
Mother.

588
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,330
Standing before your father and Dashun,

589
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,010
I'll ask you several questions.

590
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,730
Go ahead and ask.

591
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,460
Lately,

592
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,180
I've heard quite a bit of gossip

593
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,570
that you're seeing someone else.

594
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,490
But rest assured.

595
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,620
I don't believe a word of it.

596
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,330
I know you've always

597
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,810
been upright and well-behaved.

598
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,290
Mother,

599
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,140
what you've heard

600
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,980
is true.

601
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,860
How dare you admit it?

602
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,980
Yes.

603
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,620
I'm meeting someone.

604
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,050
And I intend to marry him,
taking Xuan with me.

605
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,050
Then we'll all move abroad together.

606
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,980
What did you just say?

607
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,700
You're going to marry him?

608
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,420
With Xuan,

609
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,940
you'll move abroad?

610
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,980
Mother,

611
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,220
if you didn't ask me today,

612
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,900
I'll tell you this evening.

613
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,620
Absolutely not!

614
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,050
I've made my decision.

615
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,730
How can you face Dashun?

616
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,730
I believe if his spirit watches over us,

617
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,140
he would surely stand by my choice.

618
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,010
Have you already forgotten him so soon?

619
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,770
No.

620
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,770
He will never fade from my heart,

621
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,220
not in this lifetime.

622
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,810
Yet I cannot cling to the past

623
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,810
in the rest of my life.

624
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,180
Shaohua,

625
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,420
you must not leave!

626
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,090
Don't leave us!

627
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,900
If you leave,

628
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,860
what will become of our family?

629
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,290
How will we manage our days?

630
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,330
How can we possibly go on?

631
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,810
Ershun is completely unreliable!

632
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,730
Shaohua,

633
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,330
for the sake of your father and Dashun,

634
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,700
Don't just think about yourself!

635
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,010
Think about how I will live from now on!

636
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,860
Come here, Mother.

637
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,330
Don't worry.

638
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,180
Please take a seat.

639
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,770
Mother,

640
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,860
as for this matter,

641
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
don't worry.

642
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,570
I've made a plan.

643
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,940
Why to the Chu family?

644
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,050
This is my own hard-earned legacy!

645
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,220
I'll give shares to whoever I choose!

646
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,010
Besides,

647
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,700
I give shares to the Chen family.

648
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,730
Why shouldn't

649
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,140
my birth family?

650
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,010
No!

651
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,010
You mustn't leave!

652
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,770
Don't entrust the apothecary
to outsiders.

653
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,090
Mother, please trust me.

654
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,570
Only in this way

655
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,770
can your future livelihood be secured.

656
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,380
As long as I still draw breath,

657
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,290
don't you dare leave the Chen family!

658
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,530
Let me speak bluntly now.

659
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,570
You have no say in this.

660
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,940
I've decided to leave.

661
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,220
No one will stop me.

662
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,420
The Chen family doesn't dictate
your choices!

663
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,460
I refuse to lord over you.

664
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,460
I answer only to myself!

665
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,050
You!

666
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:53,940
You!

667
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,420
You!

668
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,810
Mother,

669
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,220
I call you Mother

670
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,570
out of respect for you.

671
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,570
It's also out of consideration
for my bond with Dashun.

672
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,420
If you truly value our bond,

673
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,250
act reasonably.

674
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,050
When we meet again in the future,

675
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,380
Xuan will still call you Grandma,

676
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,700
and I will call you Mother.

677
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,940
Don't call me Mother!

678
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,180
I'll not admit you, so ruthless!

679
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,620
When did the Chen family ever wrong you?

680
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,420
Dashun treated you nicely.

681
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,940
Yet as soon as he died,
you turned to another man.

682
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,530
You're lacking in virtue.
You wretch!

683
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,090
Have I wronged the Chen family?

684
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,050
Toward Dashun,

685
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,180
I treated him with utmost respect.

686
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,010
After he passed away,

687
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,220
I remained loyal to my duties.

688
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,570
Even if I'm about to leave now,

689
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,140
for you and the Chen family,

690
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,010
I leave behind a substantial fortune.

691
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,730
I've never failed Dashun.

692
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,220
My conscience remains clear.

693
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,220
I've never failed the Chen family

694
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,220
with every obligation fulfilled.

695
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,330
Reach deep into your conscience!

696
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,330
Ask yourself

697
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,290
who saved the Chen family.

698
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,330
You should do that.

699
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,660
You can't be who you are today
without us.

700
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,420
Reaching great heights now,

701
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,700
you change your attitude
without hesitation.

702
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,290
How ungrateful you are!

703
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,860
Do you think with another man,

704
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,700
you can just go off and enjoy yourself?

705
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,810
I'm still alive!

706
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,490
Don't even think about it!

707
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,050
Do whatever you like.

708
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,660
If you dare leave, I'll die before you.

709
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,050
But you won't.

710
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Go ahead and try!

711
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Try it if you dare!

712
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,330
Shaohua, don't go.

713
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,090
Come here.

714
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,860
Mother!

715
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,290
Stop this!

716
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,420
I…

717
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,250
You must not leave!

718
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,380
You…

719
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,010
I can't believe such a shameless person

720
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,050
is part of the Chen family.

721
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,730
Mother!

722
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,980
Don't take Xuan with you.

723
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,660
Grandma!

724
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,810
Go alone!

725
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,730
Don't take Xuan with you.

726
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,090
I've raised her with all my heart.

727
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,380
She belongs to the Chen family!

728
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,490
Oh Heavens!

729
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,330
Why must you treat me this way?

730
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,900
Mother!

731
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,420
Mother!

732
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,380
Mother!

733
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
Rise.

734
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,660
Stop crying.

735
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,140
Everything has gone.

736
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,220
Mother, stop crying.

737
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,530
Otherwise, you may get sick.

738
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,050
I'm still here with you.

739
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,860
You…

740
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,220
Ershun!

741
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,900
Ershun!

742
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,420
Mother! Just hear me out!

743
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,180
To keep Shaohua, Xuan,

744
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,660
and the apothecary,

745
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,730
I have a solution.

746
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,730
Why put yourself through this misery?

747
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,090
Everything I do is for you.

748
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,570
Shaohua gave us 40 percent.

749
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,660
Are those ours?

750
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,570
It's in Mother's hands,

751
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,420
so it's in ours, right?

752
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
That might not be the case.

753
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,420
Besides,

754
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,380
you've spotted a promising venture

755
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,180
and need 100 silver dollars.

756
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,810
Here it is!

757
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,330
I won't steal

758
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,420
from Shaohua!

759
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,330
It isn't stealing,

760
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,530
but borrowing!

761
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,490
When we make money later,

762
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,900
we'll pay her back double.

763
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,980
Anyway, I'd never stoop so low

764
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,250
as to do that.

765
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,730
Besides,

766
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,530
what if Shaohua finds out?

767
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,250
When she blows up,

768
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,180
you may not be afraid, but I'm scared!

769
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,860
You're scared!

770
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,050
You fear everyone,

771
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,530
but not me, huh?

772
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,700
Yes, I'm terrified of you!

773
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,900
Go to sleep.

774
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,090
Anyway, I've found a way

775
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,420
to make sure she doesn't find out.

776
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,810
Oh, Mother!

777
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,620
Ultimately,

778
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,380
she needs a man.

779
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,940
Man?

780
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,090
Think about this.

781
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,380
Shaohua is strikingly beautiful,

782
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,730
yet she became a young widow.

783
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,290
She claims to mourn Dashun
as a chaste widow,

784
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,810
yet her mind is far from still.

785
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,660
If any man is bold enough
to rein her in,

786
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,860
she'd hardly waste time on idle fancies.

787
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,730
What do you mean?

788
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,530
Mother,

789
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,980
I have my own plan.

790
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,940
What kind of plan is this?

791
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,570
It's the only way to control her

792
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,860
and the apothecary.

793
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,460
Absolutely not!

794
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,490
Hold on a second.

795
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,690
Once I pull this off,

796
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,050
she will have to accept her fate.

797
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,210
Even if you chase her off,
she won't leave.

798
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,460
She'll be utterly devoted
to our Chen family.

799
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
You're betraying Dashun

800
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,570
and the Chen family.

801
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,820
This is nothing short of a sin!

802
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,570
If the Chen family has no heirs,

803
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,210
we'll truly fail Dashun,

804
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,300
my father

805
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,740
and our ancestors.

806
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,460
That will be a grave sin.

807
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,170
If anyone else finds it out,

808
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,530
what should I do? I...

809
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,460
This is our family affair.

810
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,380
How could anyone else possibly find out?

811
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,690
Shaohua's got quite a temperament.

812
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,300
She's not someone

813
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,980
anybody can handle!

814
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,570
I have my own plan.

815
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,820
But you'll lend a hand.

816
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,740
I…

817
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,380
Please, Mother!

818
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,090
Let me think about it.

819
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,940
Fine.

820
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,530
Think all you want.

821
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,420
Grandma.

822
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,940
Xuan,

823
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,690
don't be afraid. I'm here.

824
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,940
I'm right here.

825
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,540
Mother,

826
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,740
stop hesitating!

827
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,620
No.

828
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,210
Shun, this isn't right.

829
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,100
So tell me

830
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,490
what the right way is.

831
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,820
Just follow Shaohua's plan.

832
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,780
If we proceed with her plan,

833
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,620
over half of the shares

834
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,940
will fall into someone else's hands.

835
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,660
So be it.

836
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,740
After all, we still hold 40 percent.

837
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,740
Yes,

838
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,860
forty percent.

839
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,700
But even that depends on Jiang and Wang.

840
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,940
Let's cut to the chase.

841
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,490
They're working at the apothecary.

842
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,420
If they play tricks,

843
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,980
they will steal our shares

844
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,460
frighteningly easy.

845
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,700
They won't do that.

846
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,260
Will they do that?

847
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,300
Absolutely yes.

848
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,700
I've seen far too many such cases.

849
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,620
Besides,

850
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,660
could you bear to lose Xuan?

851
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,380
Once she leaves,

852
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,780
you may never see her again.

853
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,340
I've raised Xuan.

854
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,340
Even though she's a girl,

855
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,580
she is both smart and sensible.

856
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,100
If Shaohua takes her away,

857
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,620
I'll be heartbroken.

858
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,580
You're absolutely right.

859
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,780
So Shaohua's plan won't work.

860
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,020
Following my plan,

861
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,380
we can

862
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,620
firmly control the apothecary

863
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,340
and

864
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,380
let Xuan stay

865
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,660
by your side forever.

866
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Oh!

867
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,220
Mother,

868
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,260
just stop dilly-dallying!

869
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,220
Mother, the chicken soup is ready.

870
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,540
Who told you to come in?

871
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,700
You startled me!

872
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,540
You ask me to make it.

873
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,660
Get out!

874
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,300
Listen to me.

875
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,180
Just add this herbal bag

876
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,540
into Shaohua's chicken soup.

877
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,700
Shun,

878
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,260
I'm scared!

879
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,420
Isn't this utterly immoral?

880
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,580
It's like the levirate marriage
of old times?

881
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,980
They're different.

882
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,780
Sour chicken? Cloudy soup?
[*"Levirate marriage" was misheard.]

883
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
The chicken isn't sour!

884
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,660
And the soup isn't cloudy either!

885
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,260
Go now, or it'll be too late!

886
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,540
I need to think.

887
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,300
Come on. We're running out of time.

888
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,820
You heard Song said

889
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,180
the apothecary didn't open today.

890
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
The clerks were taking stock.

891
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,300
So, what does this mean?

892
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,580
It means
Shaohua is about to entrust it.

893
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,140
I…

894
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,540
Grandma.

895
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,900
My sweetheart.

896
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,460
Do you miss me?

897
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,660
Mother, please have a seat.

898
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,100
Are you busy?

899
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,580
I came by today

900
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,860
to apologize to you.

901
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,620
Yesterday

902
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,580
I got so flustered

903
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,860
and ended up saying harsh words.

904
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,140
Please don't take it to heart.

905
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,380
Don't let these petty matters

906
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,900
ruin our family harmony.

907
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,620
Mother,

908
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,900
what do you want?

909
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:18,860
I

910
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,460
just want to tell you

911
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,940
how I feel.

912
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,420
It's been so many years.

913
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,180
When you first came

914
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,900
to the Chen family,

915
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,140
back then,

916
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,180
I was indeed critical of you.

917
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,220
But that was
due to the Chen family's traditions.

918
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,580
Over all these years,

919
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,420
so many things have happened.

920
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,220
I know

921
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,900
you're reasonable

922
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,660
and capable.

923
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,500
You're good to me.

924
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,500
Your mother is good to me.

925
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,020
Don't you feel it?

926
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,500
The way I treat you now

927
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,660
has completely changed,

928
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,700
right?

929
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,940
Mother, it all came out

930
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,220
in the heat of the moment yesterday.

931
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,900
My tone wasn't good.

932
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,500
My apologies.

933
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,100
We're family!

934
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,820
There's no need for apologies.

935
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,180
I just want to ask.

936
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,580
Could you please not leave?
Stay with us.

937
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,140
We can't manage without you.

938
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:30,180
I can't leave without you or Xuan.

939
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,340
If you agree to stay,

940
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,980
I promise

941
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,260
from now on,

942
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,940
I will treat you as my own daughter.

943
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,020
Mother,

944
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm definitely leaving,

945
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,380
not just for my own sake,

946
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,740
to grow my business,

947
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,060
but also for Xuan,

948
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,300
to give her a better education.

949
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,260
Okay.

950
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,500
Then I'll take Xuan with me.

951
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,180
Before you leave, I'll bring her along.

952
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,340
I need to talk to her for a bit

953
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,700
and spend some time with her.

954
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,300
Better not.

955
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,580
She caught a chill days ago

956
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,820
and just started feeling better.

957
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,420
I don't want her to catch a cold again,

958
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,700
or her condition might worsen.

959
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,340
I'll travel with her in a few days.

960
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,100
She needs to recover soon.

961
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,980
Mother,

962
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,540
it's getting late.

963
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,860
Hard to see on the road.

964
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,140
If that's all, please hurry back home.

965
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,100
Fine,

966
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:32,980
your call.

967
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,340
Fine.

968
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,260
You must've eaten by now.

969
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
By the time you wrap things up,

970
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,540
it'll be midnight.

971
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,900
Drink this soup.

972
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,780
It'll help strengthen your constitution.

973
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,140
Look how thin you are.

974
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,380
Mother, thank you so much.

975
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,900
Don't mention it.

976
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,460
Be sure to finish the soup.
