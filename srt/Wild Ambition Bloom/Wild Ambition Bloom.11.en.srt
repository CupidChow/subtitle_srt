00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,940
Seems fitting enough.

192
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,460
Not at all.

193
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,860
If you want to hire me,

194
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,580
make me the head manager.

195
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,940
Wang is our head manager.

196
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,940
An outsider?

197
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,980
You prefer an outsider

198
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,180
over me?

199
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,300
These are two different things.

200
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,740
Then I must apologize.

201
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,820
Seek someone more capable.

202
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,100
Pharmacists carry weight too!

203
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,540
I cannot endure such humiliation.

204
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,540
Since you won't hire me,

205
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,060
lend me 100 silver dollars instead.

206
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,900
One hundred?

207
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,300
What for?

208
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,820
Spotted a promising venture,

209
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,100
just short of capital by that sum.

210
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,220
What sort of trade?

211
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,540
Mind your own business.

212
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,780
Guaranteed returns though.

213
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,420
When I turn a profit, I'll repay you.

214
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Without details,

215
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,420
I won't lend you money.

216
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,780
Harm none to tell you.

217
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,100
I'll partner with Mr. Wang

218
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,460
to trade timber in Henan.

219
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Which Mr. Wang?

220
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,180
Some guy who knows a buddy
of Mr. He over in East Village.

221
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,900
Timber trade, familiar territory?

222
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,060
I can understand everything
by following along for a trip.

223
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,780
Shaozhong,

224
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,420
still I cannot loose these funds.

225
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,100
Shaohua!

226
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,060
Neither finds favor.

227
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,940
Are you kidding me?

228
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,220
No, I merely sense

229
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,220
this venture lacks reliability.

230
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,740
How?

231
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,500
I see.

232
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,900
Ever since I sold Chichun Apothecary,

233
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,140
you think

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
I am unreliable,

235
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,740
right?

236
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,300
No, it's not that.

237
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,420
Shaozhong.

238
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,260
Mother.

239
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,420
Where is the food for Shaohua?

240
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,380
I've saved it.

241
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Where is Shun?

242
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,860
Still sleeping.

243
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
What hour is it?

244
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,700
How can he sleep in so late?

245
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,340
Shun!

246
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,180
Ershun!

247
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,540
The sun has been up for ages.

248
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,340
Ershun.

249
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,980
Don't shout. I can hear you.

250
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,620
Come on.

251
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,900
Pass him the chopsticks.

252
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,140
Here.

253
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,020
Where is Xuan's bowl?

254
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,940
Right away.

255
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,340
No meat?

256
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,060
No meat at high noon!

257
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,060
Here.

258
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,340
Where are you headed?

259
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,180
Without meat, can't choke this down.

260
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,140
Any meat remaining?

261
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,340
One bowl left

262
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,580
for today's dinner.

263
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,420
Fetch it for him now.

264
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,460
Xuan, eat!

265
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
Sit down and eat.

266
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,100
Mother,

267
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,460
can you give me five silver dollars?

268
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,980
What for?

269
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,820
I'm inviting friends to dinner tonight

270
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,820
to scout for potential businesses.

271
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,940
You? Businesses?

272
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,740
I'll do business to regain my footing.

273
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,780
Penniless.

274
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,020
Some is in your cedar chest.

275
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,180
Those savings aren't meant for you.

276
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,180
Merely five silver dollars.

277
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,260
That's all I need.

278
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,940
Just five silver dollars, okay?

279
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,500
Shun, listen to me clearly now.

280
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,380
I've provided you with food,
drink, and shelter.

281
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,780
You may do as you please.

282
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,500
As for money,

283
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,980
there will be none!

284
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,380
Oh, Mother.

285
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,460
Mother,

286
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,740
I know how much you cherish me.

287
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,620
You've always treated me best.

288
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,020
Don't make me slap you! Get out!

289
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,700
Mother,

290
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,300
my friends are all big shots
in business.

291
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,340
If they'd only extend a helping hand,

292
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,860
I could rise again!

293
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,660
You've got to believe me.

294
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,260
I swear.

295
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,500
I'll also swear.

296
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,860
Not a single cent more shall go to you!

297
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,460
I have no money. Eat first.

298
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,180
You won't give me?

299
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,980
Absolutely not.

300
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,260
Eat.

301
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,060
I refuse.

302
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,100
I'll starve myself to death.

303
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,220
You...

304
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,060
Are you blind?

305
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,460
What's wrong?

306
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,660
My meat!

307
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,340
My bowl!

308
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:34,820
Come on.

309
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,380
Xia Chu, eat more while you can.

310
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,260
You'll be leaving again in a few days.

311
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,660
No such feast awaits out this gate.

312
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,860
Chu, where are you going this time?

313
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,780
To France.

314
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,140
Where's France?

315
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,220
In Europe.

316
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
When are you leaving?

317
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,340
I booked passage
for the third of next month.

318
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,700
Just a few days away.

319
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,660
You just came back,

320
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,380
yet leaving again already.

321
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,540
We finally get together

322
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,540
only to separate once more.

323
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,420
You know what?

324
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,420
Yuan is…

325
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
A true man should aim far and wide.

326
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,580
Don't dwell on petty concerns.

327
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,180
Mother,

328
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,900
this cup is raised to you.

329
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,860
Thank you for your understanding.

330
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,620
Here's to it!

331
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,340
Xia Chu,

332
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,900
one more thing.

333
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,660
What is it, Mother?

334
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,420
As the verse
in The Ballad of Mulan goes,

335
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,700
A mother's soul clings to her child
through dreams.

336
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,780
Alone in distant lands,

337
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
guard yourself well.

338
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,420
If anything befalls you,

339
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,260
I truly wouldn't survive.

340
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,340
Mother, rest assured.

341
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,900
I will cherish my life dearly.

342
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,980
Yuan,

343
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,020
Mrs. Xia,

344
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,940
this toast is for you both.

345
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,740
Thank you for honoring Mother

346
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,740
in my prolonged absence.

347
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,700
Good.

348
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,540
Then I must also thank you

349
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,620
for serving the nation in my stead.

350
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,100
Chu,

351
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,180
on your journey to France,

352
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,620
may you travel safely and in peace.

353
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,780
Take your seat.

354
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,820
Eat up.

355
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,580
Have some more.

356
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,020
Chu, try this Spiced Braised Chicken.

357
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,940
Specially brought back from Qizhou.

358
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,420
You won't find this dish elsewhere!

359
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,780
Is Qizhou still as lively as ever?

360
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,300
Even more bustling than before!

361
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,740
Here.

362
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,380
Is the opera troupe by Yongshun River still performing?

363
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,460
Moved away ages ago.

364
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,380
An apothecary is there now.

365
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,460
An apothecary?

366
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,100
Speaking of which,

367
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,900
Mother, recall those Yurong Powder

368
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,300
everyone used years back?

369
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,420
Clearly.

370
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,340
That very apothecary belongs
to Mrs. Chen

371
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,140
who used to sell powders.

372
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,420
I thought they do business in Peking.

373
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,940
I heard her husband died.

374
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,060
So she returned to Qizhou
and opened an apothecary there.

375
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,140
What a capable woman she is!

376
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,700
Yes, the Chu family's daughter
from Chichun Apothecary.

377
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,460
Slow down.

378
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,480
[Huashun Apothecary]

379
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,140
Shuangxi,

380
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,300

381
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,620
Don't ignore guests knocking for ages!

382
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,180
Rest assured, Ma'am.

383
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,020
Off I go now.

384
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,580
Okay.

385
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,380
When did he leave?

386
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
Before dawn.

387
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,220
He said he went to Qizhou
to visit an old friend.

388
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,660
Right, he also left a letter.

389
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,740
He is really…

390
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,260
It's

391
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,500
you.

392
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,460
It's me.

393
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,820
When did you come back?

394
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,980
Just arrived.

395
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,860
I

396
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,340
heard about your situation.

397
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,180
Are you doing okay?

398
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,860
My apothecary is over there.

399
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I'm running a business now.

400
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,820
You finally made it.

401
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,460
Thank you for your encouragement before.

402
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,620
What are your plans moving forward?

403
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,740
Just focus on the business.

404
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,820
Earn plenty of money.

405
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,820
Raise my daughter Xuan properly

406
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,580
into someone capable.

407
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,540

409
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,140
That's reassuring.

410
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,940
And you?

411
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,450

what are your plans for the future?

415
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,540
I'm going to France

416

It's getting late.

419
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,060
I should go back.

420
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,460

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,700
The only thing that matters to me

533
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,220

535
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,740

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,060
Huashun Apothecary is selling fakes!

570
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:31,900
Ma'am.

571
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,620
What's going on?

572
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,100
-Selling poison.
-She came since we opened this morning.

573
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,580
Insisted that our herbs
caused the problem.

574
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,580
When I demanded an inspection,

575
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,140
she blocked my way.

576
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,340
And when I offered to fetch a physician,

577
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,020
she flatly refused.

578
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,860
Now she's throwing a tantrum right here.

579
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,260
You want to inspect him?

580
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,140
You're hitting me.

581
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,540
Stop! Stop!

582
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,540
She's getting beaten!

583
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,060
Look!

584
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,140
They're hitting me.

585
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,340
What on earth do you want?

586
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,540
What do I want?

587
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,940
He is lying right here!

588
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,140
Can't you see?

589
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,860
Let me make this crystal clear.

590
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,260
You will compensate me
with 10,000 silver dollars.

591
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,980
Not a single coin less.

592
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,900
No way!

593
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,860
Don't frame us!

594
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,180
Compensate us now,

595
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,820
or we'll smash your apothecary.

596
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,420
Precisely, smash it!

597
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,140
What do you want to do?

598
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,140
Whoever dares touch this apothecary

599
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,820
will meet their maker today!

600
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,900
My dear,

601
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,180
if anything happens to you,

602
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,780
how will our whole family survive?

603
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,940
It has nothing to do with us.

604
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,900
Jiang, hold your tongue!

605
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,100
Lady,

606
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,940
terribly sorry.

607
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,460
Yesterday, our clerk made an error

608
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,140
while compounding the prescription

609
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,620
by mistakenly mixing up

610
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,660
several herbs,

611
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,620
leading to your husband's

612
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,820
current condition.

613
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,060
So you're admitting it.

614
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,660
Of course, we'll admit our mistakes,

615
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,420
but no need to be hasty.

616
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,660
His condition seems critical.

617
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,940
Saving his life is our top priority.

618
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,060
I happen to have a highly potent remedy.

619
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,220
Take it,

620
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,140
and he'll recover instantly.

621
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,660
Wang,

622
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,700
fetch five qian of Wuducao.

623
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,100
Wuducao?

624
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,940
Hurry up!

625
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,780
Are you completely mad?

626
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,060
Wuducao is deadly poison.

627
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,980
Even one qian can kill

628
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,620
an ordinary person instantly.

629
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,540
Precisely.

630
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,380
Sir,

631
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,660
you may not be aware.

632
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,940
Contact with Wuducao

633
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,660
is fatal to a healthy person.

634
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,740
Yet as he ingested the mistaken mixture,

635
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,740
Wuducao now serves as its antidote.

636
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,140
This is the essence
of counteracting poison with poison.

637
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,340
Ma'am.

638
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:44,700
Alright.

639
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,500
That

640
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,860
makes sense.

641
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:48,980
Hold on.

642
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,620
Let's settle this openly!

643
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,620
If he can't recover after administering,

644
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,220
how will you defend yourself?

645
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,020
In that case,

646
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,820
I'll trade my life for his.

647
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,060
This is for him.

648
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,860
But if anything goes wrong,

649
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,660
I'll take this myself.

650
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,300
Forget it.

651
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,420
No.

652
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,620
His life is at stake!

653
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,980
Wang, pin him down!

654
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,020
No need.

655
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,380
No need for treatment.

656
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:19,740
I…

657
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,540
He's fine now. No need.

658
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,180
One saved life outweighs
constructing a grand pagoda.

659
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,740
We, we…

660
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,980
Someone, pin down his legs!

661
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:25,500
Hey, stop!

662
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,940
Give me a hand.

663
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,420
Hold down his legs.

664
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,060
Open his mouth.

665
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,380
Open it.

666
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,420
Hold it open.

667
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,980
Release.

668
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,620
Keep it open.

669
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,260
I'm healed.

670
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,940
I'm fully recovered.

671
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,620
Really?

672
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,580
Yes. Nothing is wrong.

673
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,100
Go!

674
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,380
Let's go!

675
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,180
Wait.

676
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,500
Hurry up and go!

677
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,220
Wang,

678
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,220
keep this well.

679
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,460
Don't let anyone take it by mistake.

680
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,660
Zhu, clean up here thoroughly.

681
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,140
Got it!

682
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,500
Song.

683
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,140
Ma'am.

684
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,860
Bring some tea over.

685
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:55,660
Sure.

686
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,700
You guys watch the scene
for quite some time.

687
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,620
You must have grown thirsty.

688
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,780
Jiang,

689
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,180
tell the stirred-up customers

690
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,220
all our herbs prices

691
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,980
are 10% off today.

692
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,500
Got it.

693
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,740
Great.

694
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Besides your daughter,

695
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,540
what truly binds you

696
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,340
is this very endeavor, isn't it?

697
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,900
Mr. Xia, please join me inside.

698
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,940
Alright, please head on your way now.

699
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,540
Please leave.

700
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,940
Fellow villagers,

701
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
to thank you, Ma'am offers

702
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,060
a 10% discount today!

703
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,220
It hurts.

704
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,740
You shouldn't have taken
that hit for me.

705
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,620
What hurts me most is
to see you in pain.

706
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,740
Shaohua,

707
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,900
nothing is a problem.

708
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,620
What do you mean?

709
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,740
Since you love doing business,

710
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,580
you absolutely should go
to France with me!

711
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,940
There lies the world's
oldest business school,

712
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,940
where you may pursue studies in law,

713
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,700
accounting,

714
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,980
as well as management, marketing,
and market analysis.

715
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,620
Upon completing your studies,

716
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,460
you can expand your enterprise
across the globe.

717
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,020
I believe after experiencing France,

718
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,740
you can broaden your horizons

719
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,460
and grow your business
on a larger scale.

720
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,820
Zhu.

721
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,260
Ma'am.

722
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,940
Walk Mr. Xia out.

723
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,820
Mr. Xia, after you.

724
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,020
Shaohua,

725
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,340
pursue grand ventures
if you dare embark.

726
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,940
Industry powers national progress.

727
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,500
This is important to our country.

728
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,980
Xia Chu is back.

729
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,220
I wasn't informed about this.

730
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,620
Didn't Mr. Xia mention it to you?

731
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,820
Hold on.

732
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,980
Why would

733
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,060
he stop our men?

734
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,420
I have no idea.

735
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,060
Back at the scene today,

736
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,380
if he hadn't shielded
that widow stubbornly,

737
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,300
I'd have smashed her apothecary.

738
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,380
That's strange.

739
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,260
Xia Chu has no interest

740
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,700
in the herbs trade, right?

741
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,060
Back in those earlier years,

742
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,380
Mr. Xia implored him

743
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,620
time after time.

744
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,180
Yet he pursued revolution,

745
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,100
steadfastly refusing to set foot back.

746
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,220
Maybe he's come around.

747
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,500
Pursuing revolution hardly compares
to the comfort of pursuing profits.

748
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,820
Frankly, making money wins every time.

749
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,780
Please have a seat.

750
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,500
Do you think

751
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,740
Xia Chu is back this time

752
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,140
to help Xia Yuan with his business?

753
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,700
I got it now.

754
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,940
Think about it.

755
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,620
Whether Xia Chu or Xia Yuan

756
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,020
has an eye on that young widow,

757
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,940
they've already claimed her

758
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,220

759
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,020
That's why Xia Chu's fighting tooth

760
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,340
and nail to back her, right?

761
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,980
They want to replace you with her?

762
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,140
This is already set in stone!

763
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,500
They want to get rid of me!

764
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,620
If that's true,

765
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,700
we'll be out here!

766
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,220
How?

767
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,940
The moment I walk away,

768
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,020
Mr. Xia will for sure audit the books.

769
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,860
Those shady deals we've pulled over the years…

770
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Think he'll let that slide?

771
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,460
Those deals.

772
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,860
We're sunk!

773
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,660
If this leaks out,

774
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,140
across all of Qizhou,

775
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,500
no one would hire us.

776
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,060
What do we do?

777
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:06,980
You know what?

778
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,020
Since he plays dirty,

779
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,740
I'll be ruthless.

780
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,820
He is betting everything on her.

781
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,140
I will

782
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,660
make her vanish like smoke.

783
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,500
As we strip of his bargaining chip,

784
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,460
he'll crawl back begging for my help.

785
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,420
Right.

786
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,660

We live right here on the Earth.

897
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,820
This is the Moon.

898
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,100
It circles around the Earth.

make all of this?

904
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,820
When I studied in Japan,

905
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,060
I came across a kids' astronomy book.

906
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
It blew my mind!

907
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,100
So I just drew a copy from memory

908
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,380
for Xuan.

909
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,700

913
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,100
I teach her once,

914
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,420
and she memorizes instantly! Right?

915
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,740
Yes.

916
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,300
She's mastered the multiplication tables

917
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,180
and learned loads of characters already!

918
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,260
But this isn't enough.

919
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
She deserves a systematic education.

920
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,140
