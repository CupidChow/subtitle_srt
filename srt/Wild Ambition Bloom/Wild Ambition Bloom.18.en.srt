194
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,500
Have you made up your mind yet?

195
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,500
No need to go through all this trouble.

196
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,940
Still planning to turn me down?

197
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,380
No, I agree.

198
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,380
I invited you out today

199
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,700
just to tell you my decision.

200
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,980
Just pay me
according to industry standards.

201
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,770
But I have one condition.

202
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,620
I want 10 percent
of service-based share.

203
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,860
What?

204
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,460
You heard what I said.

205
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,660
[Yangchun Noodles]

206
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,410
Fine.

207
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,770
Wen's Pharmacy welcomes you, Miss Zhu.

208
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,500
Actually, my name is Chu Shaohua.

209
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,140
Then why use the alias Zhu Sha?

210
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,500
Because it's the name of a poison.

211
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,530
Anyone, including demons and spirits,
touches it

212
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,500
will meet their doom.

213
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,770
Feeling a bit scared?

214
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,140
And a touch of regret?

215
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,570
Too late.

216
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,140
You crafty woman!

217
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,260
You were drawn by my craftiness.

218
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,980
Thank you for the flowers.

219
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,290
Mr. Tian,

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,930
do you know
about Miss Bai Bingxin's engagement

221
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,530
to Tian Tongxin?

222
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,500
Is it true?

223
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,740
What do you think about this?

224
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,260
Could you grant us an interview?

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,890
Yes. Would you share a few remarks?

226
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,570
Excuse me, make way.

227
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,340
Please, say a few words.

228
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,500
Here he comes!

229
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,500
Mr. Tian!

230
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,500
Mr. Tian,

231
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,220
when will you and Miss Bai get married?

232
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,460
Mr. Tian, will your wedding

233
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,570
be traditional Chinese or Western-style?

234
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,220
Mr. Tian,

235
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,690
where have you chosen
for the wedding venue?

236
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,980

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,620
Sun really went above and beyond!

239
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,930
Both his own newspaper

240
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,530
and his friends' carried my story!

241
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,220
And all included photos. Look!

242
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,100
Here.

243
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,530
Here.

244
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,530
Look. Photos.

245
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,930
That's incredible.

246
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,890
Wait.

247
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,770
Have you seen this?

248
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,290
Tian Tongxin's love life fully exposed.

249
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,170
List of ex-girlfriends revealed.

250
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,170
Over a dozen names are listed here.

251
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,140
I can't see any of them.

252
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,980
All I see is my own name.

253
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,770
You really don't care?

254
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,740
I do care.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,810
What I care
about is whether their family has money.

256
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,050
Speaking of his family,

257
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,650
why do both his family
and Mr. Tian himself

258
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,770
seem to avoid discussion

259
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,410
of the engagement?

260
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,690
Think carefully.

261
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,740
What does this mean?

262
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,500
It means his family doesn't approve

263
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,930
of this marriage.

264
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,620
That's precisely

265
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,980
what I expected.

266
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,020
Erniu,

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,260
you can't force things.

268
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,570
We have forced

269
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,140
everything we have today, right?

270
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,260
Fine.

271
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,570
Since you've set your mind,

272
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,690
I won't stand in your way.

273
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,620
You've also decided to work
for Wen Zhiqiu?

274
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,930
I quit my job
at Evernew Department today

275
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,340
and told Wen Zhiqiu my decision.

276
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,690
By the way,

277
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,860
Ni Xiangying's been discharged
from the hospital.

278
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,050
How's she doing?

279
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,140
Heard her suitors won't stop coming.

280
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,860
While she was hospitalized,

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,860
they sent flowers

282
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,260
and gifts every day,

283
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,170
but she turned everything down.

284
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,340
Also

285
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,340
she sent back that breakup check

286
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,530
from Mr. Tian.

287
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,650
Did I hear that right?

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,290
She sent everything back?

289
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,220
Never saw that coming, huh.

290
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,650
Turns out she's got spine.

291
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,620
We really underestimated her.

292
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,530
Can't say I agree.

293
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,140
She's just too young,

294
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,050
not nearly sharp enough.

295
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,170
If I were her,

296
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,370
I would have kept it

297
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,770
and hit him up for a massive payout!

298
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,530
That's dignity right there!

299

Shaohua,

300
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,220
money brings dignity.

301

No.

302
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,220

Alright.

These just arrived yesterday.

320
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,290
My plan is to use
the Western pharmaceutical principles

321
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,930
to reform and improve
traditional ready-made prescriptions.

322
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,290
Reform and improve?

323
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,530
I believe

324
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,890
by using
the Western pharmaceutical principles

325
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,410
and their manufacturing techniques,

326
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,980
we can undoubtedly elevate TCM

to greater heights than ever before.

328
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,740
Trying to accomplish that

329
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,770

You make it sound so difficult.

Aren't you afraid I'll turn around
and leave?

337
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,650
No, when you first walked in,

338
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,140
I saw excitement on your face.

339
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,020
But later,
you seemed a bit disappointed,

340
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,530
yet you didn't scorn me.

341
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,500
Just now in the workshop,

342
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,380
though you seemed a bit picky,

343
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,260
right now I see ambition burning

344
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,170
in your eyes.

345
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,500
All this is merely your imagination.

346
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,410
True.

347
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,020
Ms. Shen has reserved the position

348
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,290
of Assistant Director for me.

349
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,260
Comparing Evernew Department
to this place?

350
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,890
That's only the third largest
department store in Shanghai.

351
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,020
This place will be the largest soon.

352
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,860
Don't you think that's delusional?

353
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,340
Really?

354
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,140
I watch you become a clerk there

355
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,810
and in just two months,

you've become

Assistant Director.

358
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,290
Is that really delusional?
I don't think so.

359
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,810
You know the two things
I've loved doing most in life?

360
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,770
One is dreaming the impossible.

361
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,130
The other is turning those dreams
into reality.

362
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,740
You thought you knew me?

363
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,900
I barely know you.

364
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,530
I only learned your name days ago.

365
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,260
I believe if this pharmacy were

366
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,290
an established and renowned business,

367
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,850
it wouldn't have satisfied you.

368
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,090
Because we trail
behind Shanghai's top spot

369
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,770
by just a small margin,

370
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,570
you can fully unleash
your capabilities here.

No!

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,220
You're mistaken.

I'm not who you think I am.

Admit it!

You're ambitious.

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,740
but solely from nonstop advertising

569
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,700
blanketing every corner.

570
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,130
Without those ads,

571
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,330
its sales would plummet instantly.

572
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,130
Plus, the repeat purchase rate
is practically zero.

573
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,420
Who told you that?

574
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,330
That's not important.

575
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,500
What truly matters is

576
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,130
that Qingshen Pill can

577
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,770
better boost your good reputation

578
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,420
and profits

579
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,090
than the Western Bubao Pill does.

580
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,290
This has to be Tongxin's doing!

581
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,460
Withholding useless information

582
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,530
while recklessly leaking
sensitive matters.

583
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,850
So stupid!

584
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,900
Sir,

585
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,290
Tian's Apothecary

586
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,660
has always been a role model
in the industry.

587
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,090
We are deeply eager

588
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,420
to collaborate with you

589
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,330
to thrive both sides together.

590
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,180
Also we hope Qingshen Pill
will bring relief

591
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,130
and well-being to even more patients.

592
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,570
You're just trying to latch
onto me, right?

593
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,900
Not quite.

594
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,610
Do you realize

595
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,180
you are unqualified to latch onto me?

596
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,570
Do you know

597
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,020
who we do business with every day?

598
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,330
Don't call yourself a pharmacy

599
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,130
before you really are.

600
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,460
We won't stock fakes

601
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,530
or bad remedies here!

602
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,740
Sir, would this arrangement work?

603
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,770
These samples

604
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,260
will stay here with you.

605
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:48,220
Please try them personally.

606
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,900
They may offer you
a different experience.

607
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,700
Very well, I see.

608
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,420
Mr. Tian,

609
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,260
I'll take my leave then.

610
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,220
[Tian's Apothecary]

611
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,940
Jujing Apothecary is a rising star
in Shanghai's TCM market.

612
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,980
Reportedly owned by someone
from northern.

613
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:44,920
[Jujing Apothecary]

614
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,290
It has opened six branches
in just two years,

615
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,090
strategically located near every branch
of Tian's Apothecary,

616
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,370
with pricing directly competing
against them.

617
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,850
Madam, step right in!

618
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,130
Are you not feeling well?

619
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,500
We have quinine

620
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,610
for malaria.

621
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,810
Our plaster mends

622
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,980
strained from daylight toil.

623
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,020
Our Dingshen Elixir calms you

624
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,370
when you suffer plague.

625
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,370
Whose apothecary reigns supreme?

626
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,900
Shanghai's Jujing Apothecary.

627
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,770
Excuse me,

628
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,900
could I meet your head manager?

629
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,260
Madam,

630
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,420
what can he do for you?

631
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,460
I'd like to offer a prepared medicine
for sale here.

632
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,530
This is my business card.

633
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,850
Excuse me, Ms. Chu.

634
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,260
Jujing Apothecary carries

635
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,530
only our own prepared medicines.

636
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,420
Please help

637
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,700
ask your head manager.

638
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,130
Very well.

639
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,370
I'll announce your presence,

640
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,180
though I'm not sure

641
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,180
if he's available.

642
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,980
Thank you.

643
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,330
Just one dose.

644
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,700
Here you are.

645
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,610
Remember to take it properly.

646
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,220
Also, avoid raw, cold, or spicy foods.

647
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,740
Alright?

648
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,900
Yes. Thanks.

649
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,850
Ms. Chu,

650
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,500
our manager invites you upstairs.

651
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,850
That's truly wonderful!

652
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,610
Oh, may I ask how to address him?

653
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,260
His surname is Mei.

654
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,500
But the one who will meet you

655
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,940
is the big boss of Jujing Apothecary.

656
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,940
Big boss?

657
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,850
Yes, coincidentally, he's here today.

658
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,740
Seeing your business card,
he asked to see you now.

659
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,170
Please come with me.

660
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,610
Alright.

661
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,850
Thank you.

662
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,770
Ms. Chu.

663
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,290
Mr. Xia.

664
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,740
So it really is you!

665
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,900
Back then, I heard the Chens
were wiped out

666
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,260
and you didn't escape.

667
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,370
Such a tragedy!

668
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,740
But it's truly delightful to see you

669
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,130
safe and sound today.

670
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,900
I'm also pleasantly surprised

671
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,220
to see you again.

672
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,260
Take a seat.

673
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,460
How long have you been in Shanghai?

674
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,370
Almost two years now.

675
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,290
Still working with medicine?

676
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,260
Yes, just can't walk away from it.

677
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,460
I heard Wen's Pharmacy
has only been open for a few years.

678
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,900
Not very large.

679
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,220
True.

680
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,100
Then no need to stoop there.

681
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,620
Thanks.

682
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,850
Come here and help me instead.

683
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,570
To be honest,

684
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,810
I hold some stocks

685
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,020
in the pharmacy.

686
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,810
So that explains it.

687
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,050
I see.

688
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,370
Ms. Chu,

689
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,130
you haven't changed a bit.

690
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,220
Still so ambitious.

691
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,740
Perhaps the one constant in my life

692
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,850
has been this very ambition.

693
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,130
Alright.

694
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,900
Tell me

695
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,020
how you ended up coming here.

696
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,050
Well...

697
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,610
just a series of coincidences.

698
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,570
But I believe you have come here

699
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,850
with thorough preparation, huh?

700
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,370
Excellent.

701
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,050
Go on, share your thoughts.

702
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,850
You have dominated the TCM market

703
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,850
in the north.

704
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,940
Now here you aim to unify

705
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,540
both markets in the south and the north.

706
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,300
However,
the Tian family controls the south

707
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,130
with its roots in shanghai.

708
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,810
Mr. Tian is narrow-minded and petty.

709
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,740
So both families must have clashed

710
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,090
countless times over these years.

711
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,740
With your financial muscle,

712
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,700
you've opened branches
and aggressively undercut prices,

713
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,410
appearing to have made headway,

714
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,780
yet you fail to rattle

715
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,890
the Tian family's dominance here.

716
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,060
At the risk of impertinence,

717
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,330
what Jujing Apothecary needs now

718
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,940
is an exclusive secret remedy.

719
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,090
So I think

720
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,090
our newly launched Qingshen Pill

721
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,650
might lend a helping hand

722
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,220
to Jujing Apothecary.

723
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,170
See? My guess was spot-on.

724
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,060
This is indeed about business.

725
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,170
Yes, I'm here
on behalf of Wen's Pharmacy

726
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,220
to discuss cooperation with you.

727
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,220
Do you want to sell us the formula,

728
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,330
or to assist in selling your pills?

729
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,370
Not to sell just for Wenshi,

730
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,300
but for Wenshi and Jujing Apothecary.

731
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,890
If Qingshen Pill becomes a hot seller,

732
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,610
it'll boost revenue
and enhance reputation

733
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,090
for both Wen's Pharmacy

734
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,220
and Jujing Apothecary.

735
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,890
Also, it'll prove moderately beneficial

736
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,460
for your grand ambitions.

737
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,410
If we collaborate,

738
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,090
while Wenshi gains onefold benefits,

739
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,060
Jujing Apothecary will secure double.

740
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,330
Frankly, to boost revenue

741
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,540
and enhance reputation,

742
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,220
you should turn
to Tian's Apothecary instead.

743
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,330
Honestly,

744
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,500
as I was heading over here,

745
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,980
I happened to pass by Tian's Apothecary.

746
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,420
But to do business,

747
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,420
I must be capable.

748
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,210
Also I value the character of partners.

749
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,540
I have a meeting coming up soon.

750
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,380
I will certainly consider

751
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,020
your proposal.

752
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,900
Mr. Xia,

753
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,690
I couldn't partner with you in Qizhou.

754
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,900
I hope now in Shanghai,

755
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,770
we can make up for that regret.

756
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,940
[Manager's Office]
I've never met such a discourteous,

757
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,210
rude, and arrogant person!

758
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,210
You're just not worldly enough.

759
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,060
You knew his nature full well

760
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,060
before sending me there.

761
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,500
Merely to subject me to humiliation?

762
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,130
No,

763
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,770
it's just for fun.

764
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,940
I'll go next time. Okay?

765
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,980
Don't bother.

766
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,730
Next time, I'll still take the lead.

767
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,460
I'll make him pay back double

768
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,650
for today's humiliation.

769
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,900
I'm behind you!

770
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,770
Wen's Pharmacy.

771
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,340
Where?

772
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,730
Yes.

773
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,170
Tomorrow?

774
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,250
Okay.

775
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,690
See you tomorrow.

776
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,770
Mr. Mei from Jujing Apothecary called

777
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,730
to invite us to discuss

778
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,770
the cooperation details

779
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,060
for Qingshen Pill tomorrow.

780
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,730
I told them.

781
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,130
You went to Jujing Apothecary?

782
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,130
After leaving Tian's Apothecary

783
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,860
with a sense of reluctance,

784
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,540
I went straight to Jujing Apothecary.

785
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,820
You convinced them?

786
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,380
Anyway,
Mr. Xia said he would consider it.

787
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,130
Xia Yuan?

788
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,130
Did you see him?

789
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:11,980
Yes.

790
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,820
Do you know him?

791
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,980
Had some dealings with him.

792
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,980
Really?

793
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,460
Mr. Xia is quite mysterious.

794
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,290
Few here have ever seen him.

795
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,210
Did you two…?

796
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,340
What?

797
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,170
Nothing.

798
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,090
Tomorrow at Jujing Apothecary.

799
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,380
Mr. Wen,

800
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,460
why don't you try some Qingshen Pills?

801
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,570
It's settled.

802
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,820
At 4:00 PM tomorrow,

803
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,290
people from Wen's Pharmacy
will come over.

804
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,860
Got it.

805
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,290
Then by 3:00 PM tomorrow,

806
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,170
I need all the information

807
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,060
on Wen Zhiqiu and Wen's Pharmacy.

808
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,130
Got it.

809
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,650
But

810
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,820
are we really going to partner
with them?

811
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,570
Why not?

812
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,610
Over 10 categories
with over 30 varieties

813
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,860
of refreshing prepared medicines

814
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,610
are available in Shanghai.

815
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,860
And the best seller

816
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,020
is Tian's Apothecary's
Western Bunao Pill,

817
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,570
accounting for about 80%
of the market share.

818
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,730
Generally speaking,

819
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,420
once a prepared medicine occupies
over 50% of the market share,

820
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,290
a later entrant will find it hard
to break through.

821
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,500
But what if its efficacy is comparable,

822
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,340
yet it has lower cost and price?

823
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,900
We promoted several prepared medicines

824
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,420
that sold well in the north,

825
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,060
with competitive pricing.

826
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,650
However, some failed to adapt
to the local market

827
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,730
while others were strongly blocked
by Tian's Apothecary.

828
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,540
None managed to gain traction here.

829
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,820
So I want

830
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,090
to partner
with local Shanghai apothecaries

831
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,090
to see if we can adapt
to the local market.

832
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,540
But Wen's Pharmacy is simply too weak

833
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,540
to stand up to Tian's Apothecary.

834
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
You're absolutely right.

835
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,090
Wen's Pharmacy is very weak.

836
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,570
But it has one major advantage.

837
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,460
What is it?

838
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,730
By the way,

839
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,500
have any of your classmates

840
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,170
heard from Xia Chu?

841
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,090
No lately.

842
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,340
It's been ages since he last wrote home.

843
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,730
I wonder

844
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,900
how he's doing in France.

845
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,660
[Tian's Apothecary]

846
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,140
[Jujing Apothecary]

847
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,090
I must remind you.

848
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,650
Xia Yuan is meticulous,

849
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,690
shrewd and resolute.

850
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,900
If you negotiate with him,

851
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,730
you must be on high alert.

852
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:42,690
Rest assured.

853
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,610
Have you figured out how to negotiate?

854
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,020
Just take what's there.

855
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,130
Take this.

856
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,540
Let's go.

857
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,610
My coat.

858
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,730
Jujing Apothecary is much larger
than I imagined!

859
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,860
Keep your voice down.

860
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,290
Don't act like
you've never seen the world.

861
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,610
Look at this.

862
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,730
Plenty of stuff here.

863
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,540
But no their branded prepared medicines.

864
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,650
How cheap is this!

865
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,210
Why can't they outsell Tian's Apothecary
across the street?

866
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,940
Please stop talking nonsense.

867
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,340
What I said is the truth!

868
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,770
You're on their turf right now.

869
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,090
Can't speak like that here.

870
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,250
We'll talk with them shortly.

871
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,770
This is meant to be a show
of force first.

872
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,340
But you…

873
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,090
Mr. Mei.

874
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,170
Ms. Chu.

875
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,500
Mr. Mei,

876
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,250
this is Mr. Wen Zhiqiu,

877
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,690
Chairman and General Manager

878
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,860
of Wen's Pharmacy.

879
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,570
This is Mr. Mei from Jujing Apothecary.

880
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,380
Hello.

881
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,690
Hello.

882
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,650
Please lead the way.

883
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,770
Upstairs, please.

884
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,540
We'll sell such Renshen

885
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,900
for just a few hundred silver dollars.

886
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:32,980
But here, it barely qualifies

887
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,290
as third-tier,

888
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,420
worth around a thousand at best.

889
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,420
Please.

890
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,730
I happen to have a copy
of this painting.

891
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,060
Mine's just newer.

892
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,060
I only paid 3 silver dollars for it.

893
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,540
How much did you pay?

894
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,340
This Old Tree and Cold Crows

895
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,060
is an authentic work by Zhao Boju
of the Southern Song Dynasty.

896
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,860
Who?

897
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,020
Zhao Boju of the Southern Song Dynasty.

898
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,650
I don't know how much

899
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,460
Mr. Xia paid for it.

900
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,730
All I know is some collector

901
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,290
offered 20,000 silver dollars,

902
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,210
but Mr. Xia wouldn't sell.

903
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,060
If I were him, I'd have sold it!

904
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,250
Ms. Chu, please have a seat.

905
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,090
Very well.

906
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,540
Please try

907
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,210
some English black tea.

908
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,020
A gift from the British Envoy to Mr. Tang.

909
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,980
He specially presented it to Mr. Xia.

910
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,210
Mr. Tang?

911
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,210
Yes.

912
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,900
He also has a connection with Mr. Xia?

913
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,900
They're fellow mahjong players.

914
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,220
Tastes great.

915
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,980
Mr. Xia is here.

916
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,660
Then it's settled.

917
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,100
Please give my regards to Mr. Li later.

918
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,260
Alright.

919
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,260
See you.

920
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:48,900
Take care.

921
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,060
Please.

922
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,300
Hello, Shaohua.

923
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,140
Mr. Xia.

924
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,700
Hope didn't keep you waiting long.

925
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,340
Wen Zhiqiu.

926
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,700
Good. Please take a seat.

927
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,780
I have another commitment soon,

928
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,340
so let's cut to the chase.

929
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,460
Yesterday, Shaohua came and said

930
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,980
that you had some kind of medicine

931
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,660
to sell through my place.

932
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,700
Qingshen Pill.

933
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,340
Qingshen Pill.

934
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,660
Sure,

935
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:19,940
no problem.

936
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,380
But to sell it

937
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,580
at Jujing Apothecary,

938
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,300
it must not bear the name of Wenshi.

939
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,420
Mr. Xia, we…

940
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,100
No problem.

941
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,700
That's not what we agreed on earlier.

942
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,140
