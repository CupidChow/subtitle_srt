00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,460
without my permission.

187
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:46,940
Shaohua.

188
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,820
Shaozhong, why are you here?

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,220
Mother is sick

190
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,370
and wants you to come home.

191
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,010
She was fine a few days ago.

192
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,420
How come she got sick
as soon as she got back?

193
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,530
Shaozhong, I'm talking to you.

194
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,980
What's really going on with Mother?

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,010
Is it serious?

196
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,890
Not really.

197
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,530
Just caught a cold.

198
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,100
She

199
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,700
insists on seeing you.

200
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,770
Nothing else.

201
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,530
Good to hear that.

202
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,820
Why?

203
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,300
It's for Xuan.

204
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,420
Shaozhong, I can't take this.

205
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,850
Yan doesn't know. Just take it.

206
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,730
Thank you, Shaozhong.

207
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,380
[Chichun Apothecary]

208
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,180
Stop.

209
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,940
Shaohua, where are you going?

210
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,730
I'm just going
to get some medicine for Mother

211
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,250
and take a look around.

212
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,420
No need.

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,580
Mr. Yi, how do you find
the quality of the Ziwan?

214
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,220
Is the whole sack like this?

215
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,530
Yes, it's all the same.

216
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,610
Alright then.

217
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,980
Two jiao per jin.

218
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,010
Mr. Yi, please,

219
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,300
add a bit more.

220
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,940
Two jiao per jin?

221
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,130
It's hard to get by at that price.

222
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,890
That's my final price.

223
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,850
After all these years of growing Ziwan,

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,460
we've never sold it
for such a low price.

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,490
I wish I could do something about it,

226
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,420
but this is just the market price.

227
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,010
Mr. Yi, I beg of you.

228
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,730
That's not going to help.

229
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,850
You're too old
to be asking for a handout,

230
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,730
don't you think?

231
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,650
Stop pestering me.

232
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,770
Bother me again,
and it'll be one jiao and five fen.

233
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,980
He's not worth begging.

234
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,850
There are so many dealers in Qizhou.

235
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,820
I'm sure we can find one that's fair.

236
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,340
Let's go.

237
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,890
It's no use. I've asked around.

238
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,940
They all offer this price.

239
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,130
Other dealers have allied
with Shouyuan Apothecary

240
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,100
to suppress our prices.

241
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,700
Shut up.

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,700
How dare you talk like that?

243
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,220
What is that supposed to mean?

244
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,530
It's because I have good connections.

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,250
Most people see

246
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,820
their business rivals as enemies.

247
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,530
But I see them

248
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,730
as family.

249
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,610
We make money together.

250
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,530
Wise up!

251
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,340
We work long hours, come rain or shine,

252
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,010
just hoping to sell our Ziwan

253
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,650
to put food on the table
for the whole family.

254
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,100
But you're using our good harvest
to force prices down.

255
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,700
How are we supposed to survive?

256
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,890
You heartless herb dealer,

257
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,370
aren't you afraid of karma?

258
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,180
Nonsense! Who are you calling heartless?

259
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,010
You just said it yourself

260
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,850
this year's Ziwan harvest was good.

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,940
What is Ziwan?

262
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,820
It is medicine, not grain.

263
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,180
If it were grain,

264
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,370
I could stock up a whole pile,

265
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,770
and hawk it like,

266
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,180
"Grain for cheap!

267
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,220
Come

268
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,370
grab some!"

269
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,420
But this is medicine.

270
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,530
It's not like I can peddle it
on the street, shouting,

271
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,060
"Come buy our herbs!

272
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,770
Everyone, take more medicine!"

273
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm not some shady physician.

274
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,940
Let me tell you,

275
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,130
if you don't want to sell,

276
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,010
then let all your Ziwan
rot in the fields.

277
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,890
We'll see who feels the pain.

278
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,890
Oh please, like I'd sell to you!

279
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,100
Let's go.

280
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,610
Mr. Yi.

281
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,850
- Let's talk it over.
- Don't turn us down.

282
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,820
Mr. Yi.

283
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,460
Shouyuan Apothecary

284
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,180
has already made a fortune in Qizhou.

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,730
Why don't you share a bit of the profit,

286
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,940
so these herb farmers can get by?

287
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,890
Who are you?

288
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,770
Mr. Yi,

289
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,130
I'm sorry, this is my sister.

290
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,420
She just returned from out of town.

291
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,650
Don't take it to heart.

292
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,130
I won't.

293
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,700
Your sister

294
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,850
has a heart of gold.

295
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,340
So how about offering a good price

296
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,250
and taking all the Ziwan
off their hands?

297
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,980
I promise I won't compete
with your business.

298
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,130
But we're not in this trade anymore.

299
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,300
Then why

300
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,610
get involved at all?

301
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,490
It's not your money on the line,

302
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,490
so of course

303
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,010
it's easy for you to talk.

304
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,130
Mr. Yi,

305
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,940
my great-grandfather wrote the couplet

306
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,500
[Save Lives, Do Good]
back then.

307
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,020
It's been the guiding principle
of Chichun Apothecary for ages.

308
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,860
But if we chase profit at all costs
and exploit herb farmers,

309
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,140
that goes completely against
why we started this business

310
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,500
in the first place.

311
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,740
There's

312
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,940
no "we".

313
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,820
What ties do we even have?

314
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,940
Chichun Apothecary

315
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,540
has nothing to do
with your family anymore.

316
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,820
I'm in charge here.

317
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,140
If I want to smash this plaque,

318
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,300
I'll take it down,

319
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,180
step on it,

320
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,780
stomp on it, and spin around.

321
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
What does it have to do with you?

322
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,940
Mr. Yi, I apologize for any offense.

323
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,780
No offense taken.

324
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,940
Anyone who wants to sell, two jiao.

325
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,100
If you don't, then walk away.

326
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,820
Shaohua, let's go.

327
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,220
They have

328
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,340
nothing to do with you.

329
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,460
Why go out of your way to defend them?

330
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,020
One day,

331
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,100
I will get Chichun Apothecary back.

332
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,260
Mother.

333
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,820
You've got a cold.

334
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,540
What are you doing out here?

335
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm fine.

336
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,300
You're not sick?

337
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,220
Then what was going on?

338
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,460
I was waiting for you.

339
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,300
Yan found a match for you.

340
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,580
The matchmaker's here

341
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,700
to check you out.

342
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,860
Shaohua,

343
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
welcome back.

344
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,740
Let me tell you...

345
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,540
Your sister

346
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,140
is quite the looker.

347
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Master Zeng

348
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,940
isn't that old.

349
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,700
Just turned 53.

350
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,260
Yeah, not old at all,

351
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,580
just three decades older than me.

352
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,820
Yes, and he's healthy.

353
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
The physician said,

354
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,140
in all of Zeng Village,

355
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,020
Master Zeng is the only one
he's never made money from.

356
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,260
That's a rare thing.

357
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,900
Besides,

358
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,580
his family owns 300 mu
of medicinal farmland.

359
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,340
That's pretty well-off.

360
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,500
Wouldn't you say?

361
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,020
And he's very generous.

362
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,620
He's offering 30 silver dollars
as a betrothal gift.

363
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,340
Really?

364
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
What's even rarer is,

365
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,140
after his wife passed away last year,

366
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,020
there's no one else in his household.

367
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,580
His daughters got married
and moved out long ago.

368
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,900
As soon as you marry in,

369
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,140
the Zeng family

370
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,740
will be yours to manage.

371
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,220
But my husband

372
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,340
passed away not long ago.

373
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,620
If I remarry so soon,

374
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,540
what will others say

375
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,140
about me?

376
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,220
Exactly.

377
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,540
Even if Shaohua is to remarry,

378
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,860
she should wait a few more years.

379
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,820
Shaohua,

380
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,380
if you wait a few more years,

381
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,540
your looks won't be

382
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,460
quite the same.

383
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,980
And by then,

384
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,420
finding someone like Master Zeng

385
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,220
won't be so easy.

386
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,660
Besides,

387
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Master Zeng is in his mid-fifties,

388
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,780
and he's hoping for a son.

389
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,380
Miss Chu,

390
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,820
even if you can wait,

391
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,340
Master Zeng is not willing to.

392
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,100
Seeing is believing.

393
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
I want to meet him in person.

394
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,580
If he's really that great,

395
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,260
then I guess
it's not entirely off the table.

396
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,820
When do you want to meet?

397
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,500
Why wait?

398
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,860
Today will do.

399
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
Alright.

400
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,700
Mrs. Fang,

401
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,100
I'd like to talk to Master Zeng alone.

402
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,620
Please

403
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,020
excuse us.

404
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,340
Alright, I'll wait outside.

405
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,500
Call me if you need anything.

406
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,060
Master Zeng, am I up to your standards?

407
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,260
Absolutely.

408
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,020
Couldn't be happier.

409
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,220
Those fifty silver dollars?

410
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,900
Best investment I've made.

411
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,380
Come on. Take a seat.

412
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,060
Okay.

413
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,100
Master Zeng,

414
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,900
for a remarried widow like me,

415
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
you're still willing to offer
such a generous gift.

416
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm genuinely touched.

417
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,340
Don't just be moved.

418
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,420
Let's make it official.

419
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
I can tell

420
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,220
you're a good person.

421
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Good? I'm amazing.

422
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,300
I've got all kinds of wonderful traits.

423
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,740
Just wait till we're married.

424
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,340
You'll be impressed.

425
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,260
You're kind,

426
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,260
so I owe you the truth.

427
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,820
There are things

428
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,500
you should know before we move forward.

429
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,260
Go ahead.

430
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,300
When I was young,

431
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,020
someone once read my fortune.

432
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,780
They said I had a cursed fate,

433
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,260
bringing misfortune to my father,

434
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,580
and later to my husband.

435
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,620
Fortune-telling isn't always accurate.

436
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,380
I thought so too at first.

437
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,580
But then what happened

438
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,140
made me believe it.

439
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,380
My grandfather passed away
when I was seven.

440
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,940
My father died when I was 14.

441
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,420
After I married into the Chen family,

442
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,780
both my father-in-law
and husband passed away.

443
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,980
Really?

444
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,860
Didn't Mrs. Fang tell you?

445
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,020
Well...

446
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,700
You carry a powerful destiny.

447
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm not sure I'm lucky enough
to handle that.

448
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,060
Mr. Zeng, to be honest,

449
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,980
I had given up

450
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,980
on the idea of remarrying.

451
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,700
But then,

452
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,980
I met you.

453
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,420
You're kind,

454
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,180
and your family is well-off. I...

455
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,700
It's really nothing worth mentioning.

456
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,980
Master Zeng, I hope
you didn't take it the wrong way.

457
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,900
I don't want to hurt you.

458
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,260
I just figured, why let someone else
benefit from such good fortune?

459
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,300
We may not be destined for each other,

460
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,740
but I believe

461
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,460
my cousin would be a great fit for you.

462
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,300
You have a cousin?

463
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,980
What's she like?

464
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,220
My cousin

465
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,620
is around my age.

466
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,980
If we're talking about looks,

467
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,740
she's definitely no worse than I am.

468
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,380
Most importantly,

469
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,340
she really has a look of good fortune.

470
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,020
According to the fortune teller,

471
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,940
she'd bring her husband good fortune

472
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,300
and two sons.

473
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,780
Is that so?

474
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,100
If you don't believe me,

475
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,780
you can come and see for yourself.

476
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,220
If she suits you,

477
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,500
then 20 silver dollars

478
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,180
will be enough for the betrothal.

479
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,260
Really?

480
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,740
The amount of money

481
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,740
doesn't matter.

482
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,900
You're a good man,

483
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,620
and we'd be honored
to have you join our family.

484
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,860
Master Zeng,

485
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,500
when are you available?

486
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,340
Today is the first day
of the lunar month.

487
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,380
The second, the third, the fourth.

488
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,700
I'll come by your place on the fourth.

489
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,220
OK, it's settled.

490
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,780
But Master Zeng,

491
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,500
this has to stay between us.

492
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,340
Especially don't let Mrs. Fang find out.

493
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,700
Why?

494
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,100
Just so you know,

495
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,500
Mrs. Fang has been

496
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,380
pushing my cousin toward her nephew,

497
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,500
but my cousin's not having it,

498
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,100
and now both families are at odds.

499
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,380
If she finds out

500
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,540
I introduced you to my cousin,

501
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,460
I'm afraid she'll ruin it for you.

502
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,140
I will keep silent.

503
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,860
The fourth?

504
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,620
Yes.

505
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,300
Master Zeng is coming
to present the betrothal gift.

506
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,940
That's great.

507
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,620
Shaohua, congratulations.

508
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,580
Shaohua,

509
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
are you sure about this?

510
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,500
Master Zeng is quite a bit older
than you.

511
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
That means he'll be more caring.

512
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,860
- What do you know?
- Yan.

513
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,660
Shaozhong, don't worry about it.

514
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,220
Let's see how things go on the fourth.

515
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,740
I'll check in with Mrs. Fang.

516
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,940
She'll know what we should prepare.

517
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,580
Yan.

518
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,300
You can't tell her about this.

519
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,900
Why?

520
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,060
Did Mrs. Fang tell you

521
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,620
Master Zeng gave thirty silver dollars
as a betrothal gift?

522
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,020
Yes.

523
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,380
He promised

524
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,380
sixty silver dollars.

525
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,340
Sixty?

526
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,020
Master Zeng told me himself.

527
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,580
She actually deducted ten...

528
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,620
She actually dared to dock
30 silver dollars from me.

529
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
That's why

530
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,860
Mrs. Fang is not someone
to associate with.

531
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,180
I am never speaking

532
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,100
to her again.

533
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,140
Also,

534
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,380
you can't tell anyone else
about this either.

535
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,660
If the Chen family finds out,

536
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,300
they'll try to get in the way.

537
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,740
Yes, Shaohua,

538
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,220
you're indeed thoughtful.

539
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,020
I won't say anything.

540
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,340
I'll come back

541
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,620
on the fourth with some excuse.

542
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,020
Before that,

543
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,340
I'll need you

544
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,780
to get the house in order

545
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,340
and prepare some fine wine and meat.

546
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,180
We can't let Master Zeng
look down on our family.

547
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,700
Don't worry.

548
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,180
I'll take care of everything.

549
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,700
Master Zeng's got
more money than the Chen family,

550
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,580
and he's generous too.

551
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,300
If this marriage goes through,

552
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,060
we'll have someone to rely on.

553
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,020
And with my skills,

554
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,620
I can make sure he listens to me.

555
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,180
That's wonderful.

556
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,580
Shaohua, you've come to your senses.

557
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,900
Mother.

558
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,100
Is Shaohua here?

559
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,780
Not yet.

560
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,340
It's almost noon.

561
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,500
Why isn't she back yet?

562
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,340
Maybe she was delayed on the way.

563
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,380
Shaozhong,

564
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,300
go check if she's almost home.

565
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,580
I'm just worried that that old hag
from the Chen family

566
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,900
might have held her back.

567
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,500
Chicken and other meat?

568
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,340
Must've cost a fortune.

569
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,460
One silver dollar.

570
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,020
So much?

571
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,100
Mother, you can't reel in a big catch
without some bait.

572
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,900
Master Zeng is giving 60 silver dollars.

573
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,900
True.

574
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,300
We didn't have much to spare,
as I recall.

575
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,020
Where did you get the money?

576
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,500
I borrowed it from Ms. Feng.

577
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,020
I'll just pay her back later.

578
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,500
I think

579
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,380
it would be best for Master Zeng

580
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,940
to make things official.

581
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,380
I mean, is it really necessary?

582
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,260
What?

583
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm doing this for Shaohua's sake.

584
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,340
She told me that day

585
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,260
not to let Master Zeng
look down on our family.

586
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
Here, put this on.

587
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,020
Hurry.

588
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,580
I don't want to.

589
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,140
You...

590
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,940
Zhou Yan.

591
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,580
Master Zeng is here!

592
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,300
Hurry!

593
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,820
Why so early?

594
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,820
Mother.

595
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,060
Master Zeng.

596
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,140
Hello, Master Zeng.

597
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,260
Hello.

598
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,220
You must be Zhou Yan, right?

599
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,020
You know me?

600
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Of course I do.

601
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,780
I'm sorry,

602
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Shaohua isn't back yet.

603
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,460
No,

604
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
it doesn't matter if she's here or not.

605
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,940
Having you here is more than enough.

606
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,580
Master Zeng,
you've got a way with words.

607
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,660
Master Zeng, please come in.

608
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,820
Please.

609
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,180
- I'll go in.
- Please.

610
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,020
Alright, I'll make myself at home.

611
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,140
Mother, get some water boiling.

612
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,660
Master Zeng,

613
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,740
Shaohua's been full of praise for you.

614
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,780
She's truly happy

615
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,740
about this match.

616
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Master Zeng, are you satisfied?

617
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,020
Of course I am.

618
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,540
Good to hear that.

619
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,180
It's wonderful.

620
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,900
When Shaohua said it,

621
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,100
I had my doubts.

622
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,660
Seeing you today, I get it.

623
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,380
You've got that lucky aura
for husband and children alike.

624
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,300
Master Zeng, you could
talk your way into anything.

625
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,820
What do you say

626
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,340
we pick a date today?

627
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,100
So soon?

628
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,820
It's a joyful occasion, so naturally,

629
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,820
the sooner the better.

630
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,380
You're more eager than I am.

631
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,460
Aren't you?

632
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,780
It's one of the three great joys
in life,

633
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,660
the wedding night.

634
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,860
What?

635
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,020
You're thinking about the wedding night?

636
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,660
Master Zeng, you're quite the character.

637
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,180
Without the wedding night,

638
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
how would you have a son?

639
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,780
Yes, we need two sons.

640
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,780
It's settled then, Master Zeng,

641
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,860
a son by next year.

642
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,700
Next year?

643
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,940
With your figure,

644
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,260
I'd say that baby's coming sooner.

645
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,100
What are you doing?

646
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,620
You were so excited
about our wedding night.

647
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,020
What's there to be shy about now, Yan?

648
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:15,980
Right?

649
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,580
You old geezer.

650
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,220
You have to hold the brush like this.

651
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,260
See? Straight down.

652
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,980
Straight down.

653
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,420
Thread the needle.

654
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,220
That...

655
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,460
Downward.

656
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,180
They say that matchmaker

657
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,820
must be out of her mind.

658
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,540
The husband's perfectly fine,

659
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,060
and she introduced
his wife to that old man

660
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,340
who even came
to discuss a marriage arrangement.

661
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,740
In front of her husband?

662
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,700
Exactly.

663
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,500
He even came to their house
and started getting handsy with her.

664
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,260
How disgraceful.

665
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
Mother, which village
did that come from?

666
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,540
Chu Shaohua.

667
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,020
What have you done?

668
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,780
How dare you scheme against me!

669
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,060
Chu Shaohua!

670
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,580
I'm not letting this slide!

671
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,940
Neither am I.

672
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,900
You dare to hit me?

673
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,820
I'm your sister-in-law!

674
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,100
If you really saw yourself that way,

675
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,140
you wouldn't have done
something so disgraceful!

676
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,140
I'm telling you,

677
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,340
my mother-in-law
and my sister-in-law are both here.

678
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
If I tell everyone what you really did,

679
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,060
I won't be the only one
itching to slap you.

680
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,220
I...

681
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,820
I was doing it for your good.

682
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,380
For me or for yourself?

683
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,100
Everyone knows the truth.

684
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,940
Zhou Yan, I'm warning you.

685
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,700
This was just a small lesson.

686
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,100
From now on,

687
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,620
if you ever try
to pull something like that again,

688
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,860
I've got plenty of ways
to deal with you.

689
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,300
Alright, Chu Shaohua,

690
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,780
I'm telling you,

691
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,460
from now on,

692
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,380
Shaozhong and I are cutting all ties

693
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
with you!

694
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,780
What are you doing?

695
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,420
Get out of here!

696
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,260
Don't you get smug.

697
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,180
You'll get what's coming to you.

698
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,380
Shaohua, why did you hit her?

699
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,900
That wife Mother was talking about?

700
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,140
It's her.

701
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
As soon as I came back, I told her

702
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,540
that I only wanted to live a quiet life

703
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,740
with Xuan.

704
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,060
Nothing else.

705
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,020
But she set me up,

706
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
trying to marry me off
to some old man as a second wife,

707
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,900
just to make a profit out of it.

708
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,260
Then you

709
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,980
introduced that old man

710
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,420
to her?

711
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,380
Since she schemed against me like that,

712
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,780
I didn't hold back either.

713
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,860
Exactly.

714
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,060
Why didn't you say so earlier, Shaohua?

715
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,540
When she came in just now,

716
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,020
I should have given her two slaps!

717
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,140
We're not

718
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,300
pushovers.

719
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,220
Exactly.

720
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,380
Serves her right.

721
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,580
But Shaohua,

722
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,740
you're really not

723
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,420
considering getting married again?

724
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,780
Mother, if I really meant to do that,

725
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,220
I wouldn't have caused such a scene.

726
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,260
Shaohua,

727
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,860
everything Dashun and I did for you

728
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,740
was worth it.

729
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,780
Mother, don't say these things
in front of Xuan.

730
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,220
Okay.

731
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,580
Good writing.

732
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,020
From now on,

733
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,380
you two

734
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,060
will eat fine grain, too.

735
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,220
We can afford that.

736
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,900
Mother, can you lend me
20 silver dollars?

737
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,260
Lend you money?

738
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,740
Absolutely not.

739
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,340
Lending you money

740
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,620
is out of the question.

741
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,180
How much are these worth?

742
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,180
Absolute pawn or redeemable pawn?

743
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,100
What's the rate for absolute pawn?

744
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,020
And for redeemable?

745
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,860
For absolute pawn,
it's 25 silver dollars.

746
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,700
For redeemable pawn, 15.

747
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,660
These jewels cost

748
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,140
at least 100 silver dollars back then.

749
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,980

00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,580

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,260

Wait.

754
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
And this too.

755
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,780
How about this?

756
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,980
I'll add one more silver dollar for you.

757
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,140
That's 26 in total.

758
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,740
Sir,

759
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,060
how much Ziwan do you expect
to harvest this season?

760
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,940
Over a thousand jin, I suppose.

761
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,980
Give it all to me.

762
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,340
I'll settle with you
at the highest price,

763
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,860
three jiao five fen per jin.
How does that sound?

764
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:10,860
Really?

765
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,900
Of course.
We can sign a contract as proof.

766
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,020
And I can give you

767
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,340
a ten percent deposit right now.

768
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,540
On the day
the Qizhou Medicine Market closes,

769
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,140
I'll pay the remaining balance in full.

770
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,620
That's great.

771
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,900
But I have some conditions.

772
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,820
First,

773
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,340
you're not allowed

774
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,180
to sell your Ziwan to anyone else.

775
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,660
Second, you must deliver
the goods upfront.

776
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,580
Third, everything we agree on

777
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
must remain strictly confidential.

778
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,460
You're not to tell anyone.

779
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,580
No problem.

780
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,060
[Currency and Metal Exchange]
Collateral on undelivered stock?

781
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,060
That's not how we do business.

782
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,580
Collateral

783
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,260
is just trading goods for money.

784
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,900
There may be no precedent
for mortgaging crude drugs,

785
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,380
but this batch of Ziwan

786
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,620
is undeniably worth 350 silver dollars.

787
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,940
It's within the bounds of fair exchange.

788
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,420
But the price of Ziwan fluctuates,
you know.

789
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,380
Then let's go
by last season's Ziwan price,

790
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,820
two jiao per jin.

791
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,940
This batch of Ziwan is over 1,000 jin,

792
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,220
worth at least 200 silver dollars.

793
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,100
In the medicine market,

794
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,460
what rose last season will fall next,

795
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,180
and what fell will surely rise.

796
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
So you have no risk.

797
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,460
I can only give you
a maximum of 150 silver dollars.

798
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,540
That works too.

799

That's 150 silver dollars in total.

802
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,340
I have no other requests.

803
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,420

of Ziwan as collateral.

We can give you
a maximum of 500 silver dollars.

809
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,100
You won't need to hawk them yourself
at the Medicine Market,

810
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,100
and you won't be taken advantage of
by those colluding herb dealers.

is opening soon.

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,700
I wonder if the price of Ziwan

820
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,020
will go up a bit.

821
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,060
You're a pawnshop owner.

822
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,660
Why the sudden interest in Ziwan?

823
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,740
You might not know.

The Ziwan you hold as collateral

888
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,300

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,420

is just around the corner.

both your principal
and interest in full.

892
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,140
That's good news, isn't it?

893
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,980

895
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,300
Of course I do.

896
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
If the price of Qizhou Ziwan

897
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,060

to recover your principal.

00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,340
You fear the price
of the Qizhou Ziwan will sink

927
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,420
below two jiao this year.

928
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,220
Trust me,

929
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,740
I can not only make sure
the price doesn't drop,

930
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,300
but also even drive it

931
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,180

What's the way?

933
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,900
Last year's plunge in Ziwan prices

934
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,420
was all because the herb dealers
teamed up

935
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,460
to drive them down.

936
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,980
This year, we can turn the tables,

937
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,260
use their own tactics against them

938
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,980
and push the price back up.

939
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,780

your help, Mr. Li.

That's 5,000.

for a good price?

How's business today?

Let me tell you,

983
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,100
several groups of customers came today.

984
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,340
The prices offered were quite high.

985

Honestly,

1020
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,260
