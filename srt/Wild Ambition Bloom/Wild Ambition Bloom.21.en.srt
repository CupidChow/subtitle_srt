Yes.

If we can help him find his daughter,

She went to Tsitsihar?

66

Shortly after arriving in Shanghai,

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,010
she dumped the man who had lured her.

Going to Xia Yuan's place for dinner?

192
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,180
A family gathering.

193
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,690
Li.

194
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,100
Who will be there from their family?

195
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,770
Just family members.

196
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,810
I think I won't go after all.

197
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,690
Why?

198
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,810
I'm not comfortable visiting
others' homes.

199
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,690
But they specifically invited you!

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,130
I'm not feeling well.

201
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,860
I haven't told you the day yet.

202
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,420
I may not feel well any day.

203
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,300
Hey.

204
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,210
Didn't you work overtime today?

205
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,660
Miss Bai, the phone call.

206
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,810
Coming.

207
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,740
Who's calling?

208
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,450
That Mr. Tian again?

209
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,500
Tell him I'm out.

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,010
Whenever he calls, tell him I'm out.

211
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,100
Mr. Tian?

212
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,300
Yes.

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,540
I've dumped him,

214
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,620
but he just won't give up

215
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,810
and keeps pestering me.

216
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,060
He thinks there's hope.

217
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,690
Tell me

218
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,060
how I can make him give up completely.

219
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,060
I don't know.

220
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:28,980
I don't even know

221
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,130
how I should move on entirely.

222
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,380
Haven't moved on?

223
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,970
I thought I could move past it.

224
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,780
But

225
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,810
those old memories

226
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,330
keep bubbling up.

227
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,450
It's okay.

228
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,060
As long as we keep running forward,

229
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,420
even if it bubbles up again,

230
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,450
it won't cling to us, right?

231
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,330
Let's hope so.

232
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,940
Mr. Xia!

233
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,330
Just saw Wen's Pharmacy mentioned

234
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,060
in the newspaper

235
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,970
and here you are.

236
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,210
What's the news?

237
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,420
In Shanghai's top 10 TCM apothecaries,

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,690
Wen's Pharmacy ranks ninth!

239
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,450
I thought they wouldn't make it
till later this year.

240
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,090
How impatient these reporters are!

241
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,540
Well-deserved!

242
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,380
Please have a seat.

243
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,810
But credit also goes to Mr. Tian.

244
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,490
If he hadn't held Professor Claudy

245
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,330
in such high regard,

246
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,540
Oriental Bunao Pill

247
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,970
wouldn't have been out of stock.

248
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,940
It's still flying off shelves?

249
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,970
Though with two more workshops,

250
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,060
I still can't guarantee a stable supply.

251
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,090
Mr. Wen,

252
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,420
congratulations on booming business!

253
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,300
Mr. Xia, shared prosperity indeed!

254
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,860
Did you come alone?

255
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,140
Where's Shaohua?

256
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,900
She felt a bit unwell today.

257
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,620
Serious?

258
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,570
Should be fine.

259
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,580
Just worn out from these busy days.

260
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,460
Rest should fix her right up.

261
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,490
Alright then.

262
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,420
Let her get some good rest.

263
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,380
Come on, try this tea.

264
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,570
From England?

265
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,380
Black tea.

266
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,570
Give it a taste!

267
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,820
My brother

268
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,540
specifically sent it from Europe.

269
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,900
You have a brother?

270
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,450
Studying in France now.

271
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,700
That's him over there.

272
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,100
Exceptionally handsome and promising!

273
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,140
Absolutely!

274
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,090
He's way better looking than I am.

275
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,660
Besides,

276
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
he's seriously smart.

277
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,260
He always topped every subject!

278
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,060
Later he went to study in Japan,

279
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,260
and pursued two majors,

280
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,900
both with straight A's.

281
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,660
After that,

282
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,220
he went to France for further study!

283
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,500
This is a photo he took
with his classmates in Paris.

284
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,850
Is this his wife?

285
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,450
His girlfriend.

286
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,940
But I guess

287
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,570
they'll marry soon.

288
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,850
Mother.

289
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,090
This must be Mr. Wen.

290
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,610
Mother, let me introduce.

291
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,580
This is Wen Zhiqiu,

292
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,740
owner of Wen's Pharmacy.

293
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,220
Good day, Madam.

294
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,140
How do you do?

295
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,570
Xia Yuan often mentions

296
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,780
that you're capable.

297
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,660
Seeing you today,

298
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,690
I can see what a dashing person you are!

299
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
You flattered me!

300
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,140
Your sons are truly exceptional.

301
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,020
How can they ever compare with you?

302
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,580
Indeed.

303
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,860
I pale in comparison.

304
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,100
Mr. Wen, you're joking!

305
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
This is my wife.

306
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,740
Mrs. Xia.

307
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,060
Greetings, Mr. Wen!

308
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,810
Shall we take our seats?

309
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,740
Mother.

310
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,570
Please.

311
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,210
- Please.
- Come.

312
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,380
Mother.

313
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,660
Mr. Wen, this way please.

314
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,900
I thought Ms. Chu would join us today.

315
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,490
She's unwell,

316
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,420
so won't be attending.

317
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,140
Today

318
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,380
I had our chef prepared

319
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,450
some Qizhou dishes for her.

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,490
Too bad she'll miss out on them!

321
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,300
Indeed.

322
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,260
Perhaps

323
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,260
have some Qizhou dishes packed

324
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,020
and sent to her.

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,610
Good idea!

326
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,610
Oh right!

327
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,970
Also send over those Qizhou specialties

328
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,810
Mr. Gao brought back.

329
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,570
Okay.

330
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,090
Understood.

331
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:44,900
Mother,

332
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,900
I think we should send them

333
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,850
a few days later.

334
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,780
Why?

335
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,380
She hasn't been feeling well lately.

336
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,380
If she sees familiar things,

337
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,800
I worry remembering past events

338
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,020
will make her even sadder.

339
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,540
Oh! I completely missed that angle!

340
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,020
What are the past events?

341
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,180
You don't know?

342
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,220
She's never once mentioned it to me.

343
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,700
Because what happened to her

344
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,180
made headlines back then.

345
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,860
I assumed you knew all about them!

346
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,220
Yes.

347
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,580
When reading the news years ago,

348
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,300
I thought how miserable she was.

349
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,420
But later Xia Yuan told me

350
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,060
after losing her husband and daughter,

351
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,300
and suffering the family ruin,

352
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,260
she didn't collapse under grief.

353
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,860
Instead, she's built with you

354
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,780
something truly thriving!

355
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,220
She truly embodies

356
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,260
a modern-day Mulan!

357
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,340
Thinking back, I…

358
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:48,900
Mother,

359
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,860
shall we begin the feast now?

360
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,420
Yes, let's enjoy!

361
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,060
Come now!

362
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,020
Mr. Wen.

363
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,260
Mr. Xia,

364
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,980
welcome!

365
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,140
Please.

366
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,900
After losing her husband and daughter,

367
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,180
and suffering the family ruin,

368
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,140
she didn't collapse under grief.

369
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,660
Instead, she's built with you

370
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,330
something truly thriving.

371
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,090
She truly embodies

372
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,260
a modern-day Mulan!

373
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:51,940
[Yangchun Noodles]

374
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,060
I thought you dined at Xia Yuan's place.

375
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,820
Why are you here for wontons?
Didn't get enough to eat?

376
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,900
Want a bowl?

377
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,820
Sure!

378
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,340
Boss! One more bowl of wontons!

379
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,100
Oh right.

380
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,020
You want to discuss with me, huh?

381
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,740
Xia Yuan mentioned

382
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,420
we could collaborate further.

383
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
What do you think?

384
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
I think it's a great idea!

385
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,180
Did he mention the details?

386
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,820
No details given.

387
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,500
Who did you meet at his place today?

388
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,140
His mother

389
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,940
and his wife.

390
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,900
Didn't see his children.

391
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,300
They seem to board at school.

392
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,220
Only learned today

393
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,340
that he has a brother

394
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,380
studying in France.

395
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,020
Your wontons are ready!

396
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,820
- Thanks!
- Thanks.

397
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,540
Enjoy your meal.

398
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,580
Has his…

399
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,420
Thank you.

400
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,420
Has his brother

401
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
got married yet?

402
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,980
Not yet, but soon.

403
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,460
She must be very beautiful, right?

404
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,580
Yes.

405
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,420
Truly stunning.

406
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,220
I used to think you were strange.

407
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,980
Didn't realize you had a profound past.

408
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,820
Everyone has past.

409
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,020
I mean

410
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,740
Sanshou Gang and Huashun Apothecary.

411
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,340
You had a daughter.

412
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,860
Eat now. Let's drop this topic.

413
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,580
Saw it in the papers before,

414
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
but didn't connect the dots.

415
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,300
Always felt...

416
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,180
Let's stop.

417
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,700
Speak it out and you may feel better.

418
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,580
I've long since let go of it.

419
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,100
If you hadn't brought it up,
I wouldn't have remembered it.

420
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,620
Letting go of or avoiding it?

421
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
What am I avoiding?

422
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,660
Otherwise why

423
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,180
would you refuse to go with me today?

424
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,620
Fear of seeing old acquaintances?

425
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,180
Or perhaps...

426
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,300
Just eat wontons!

427
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,260
Do you consider me a friend?

428
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,180
No.

429
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,420
We're just partners.

430
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,180
That direct, huh?

431
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,780
Fine.

432
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,140
I just hope you can

433
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,620
live happily and more lightheartedly.

434
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,770
I am truly happy

435
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,980
and lightheartedly.

436
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,660
Thank you for caring.

437
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,980
It doesn't seem so.

438
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,380
Truly, I want to help you.

439
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,570
I don't need your help.

440
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,940
Nor do I want anyone's pity.

441
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,660
That's not what I meant.

442
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,700
Whether I can let go

443
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,330
or move on or not,

444
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,490
that's my own business.

445
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,050
All I want is to care about you.

446
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,490
None of your business.

447
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,790
Are the Cost Statement

448
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,140
and Income and Expenditure Statement
ready?

449
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,660
On your desk.

450
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,140
Qingyu Apothecary's contract...

451
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,490
Will be ready by 10 AM.

452
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,940
And that merchant on Sima Road…

453
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,900
The figure missing

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,490
will be filled in by this afternoon.

455
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,140
Come in!

456
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,050
Wu.

457
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,460
Mr. Wen, Ms. Chu,

458
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,620
would you two honor

459
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,730
my wedding next month?

460
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,770
Thank you.

461
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,730
Impressive!

462
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,380
You really kept it quiet.

463
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,050
Who's the bride?

464
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,220
A girl from my hometown.

465
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,330
We grew up together.

466
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,330
Childhood sweethearts.

467
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,460
And would you do me a favor?

468
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,530
Mr. Wen,
could you be my wedding witness?

469
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:32,900
Of course!

470
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,460
Ms. Chu, would you host the ceremony?

471
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,330
Me?

472
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,050
She won't do.

473
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,810
Why?

474
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,380
She is not good at speaking.

475
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,810
Few can match her eloquence.

476
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,490
Let me host it.

477
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,180
But you will be the witness.

478
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,250
I can do both.

479
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,730
Can you handle both?

480
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,290
No problem.

481
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,810
Perhaps you can be the host

482
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,770
and Ms. Chu the witness.

483
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,220
She might not have time for the wedding.

484
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,980
Ms. Chu, you won't make it?

485
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,490
She has a business trip scheduled.

486
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,250
That's such a pity.

487
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,940
Truly, such a pity.

488
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,490
The business trip

489
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,460
can be pushed back.

490
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,940
Wu, don't worry.

491
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,460
I'll absolutely be at your wedding.

492
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,420
Also

493
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,730
you can count on me for hosting duties.

494
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,050
That's perfect!

495
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,620
When bringing me lunch last time,

496
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,570
my girlfriend saw you

497
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,730
and was charmed
by your poise and talent.

498
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,980
She mentioned it repeatedly

499
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,770
that we must have you at our wedding.

500
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,010
Thank you.

501
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,010
Thanks, Ms. Chu.

502
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,810
Thanks, Mr. Wen.

503
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,250
May your love endure forever!

504
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:32,900
Thank you.

505
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,700
Thank you.

506
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,700
I know you were caring about me.

507
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,290
Worried I might get upset
during the wedding.

508
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,460
So you know I care about you.

509
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,050
Yesterday

510
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,250
I acted on impulse.

511
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,530
Sorry.

512
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,010
From now on,

513
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,490
you don't have to consider my feelings.

514
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,050
Because I've grown

515
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,180
thick skin anyway.

516
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,810
I know you have.

517
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,090
That's why I provoked you yesterday,

518
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,460
forcing you to confront your true self.

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,860
Make a qipao!

520
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,770
Why bother?

521
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,330
You're attending a wedding.

522
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,700
It's not my wedding.

523
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,220
But please consider

524
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,330
upholding Wen's Pharmacy's reputation.

525
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,250
If we're talking about that,

526
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,050
then yes.

527
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,460
But you'll cover the cost.

528
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,530
You're also our shareholder.

529
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,620
Why should I?

530
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,050
I never intended to make a qipao.

531
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,180
You asked me to.

532
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,810
And you're the majority shareholder.

533
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,460
Deal.

534
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,010
Also

535
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,490
I think it's time to swap out my shoes.

536
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,140
These ones are…

537
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,730
Don't push it.

538
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,220
And I should

539
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,770
buy a new bag.

540
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,810
Ms. Chu,

541
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,730
go on a business trip to Suzhou.

542
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,530
Come in.

543
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,900
Mr. Wen, today's newspaper.

544
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,290
Thanks!

545
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,940
Mr. Wen, Evernew Department then.

546
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,250
It's settled then.

[Another Stir
Between Tian Tongxin and Bai Bingxin]

549

Erniu!

550
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,250
Erniu!

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,730
What's wrong?

552
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,010
Mr. Tian has committed suicide!

553
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,140
I thought it was something serious!

554
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,810
Sun told me

555
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,380
he took pills last night,

556
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,530
and he is alright now.

557
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,290
But aren't you going to visit him?

558
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,940
Why would I?

559
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,730
He tried to kill himself for you.

560
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,250
Attempted suicide over a breakup.

561
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,940
How utterly contemptible!

562
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,570
Guess how many pills he took?

563
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,140
Three.

564
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,050
Three?

565
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,330
If they hadn't sent him
to the hospital in time,

566
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,940
before starting a stomach pump,

567
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,140
he would've woken up.

568
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,290
But I think you should go see him.

569
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,090
You two shared something special,
after all.

570
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,490
Don't be so harsh.

571
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,730
Remember how he treated Ni Xiangying?

572
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,730
That was truly harsh.

573
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,860
I've done all I could for him!

574
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,570
But to marry him,

575
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,140
you tried every trick in the book.

576
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,090
Why did you change so fast?

577
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,730
I should thank you for that.

578
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,810
Me?

579
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,660
If not for your lawsuit,

580
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,140
I'd still be living in fantasy

581
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,730
of marrying into his family.

582
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,420
Only now do I realize

583
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,570
they never saw me

584
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,460
as one of their own.

585
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,810
Precisely speaking,

586
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,490
they didn't even treat me as a human.

587
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,140
Since this is a dead end,

588
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,730
I must make a better choice.

589
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,860
It's good you think this way.

590
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,570
Truly comforting.

591
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,660
Rest assured.

592
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,330
Arrived this early?

593
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,730
Wait for me.

594
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,980
I'll change clothes and come down.

595
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,460
Who's he?

596
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,140
A man.

597
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,620
But you said you'd make a better choice.

598
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,010
His name's Mu Ziru,

599
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,770
the fourth man in Qing Gang,

600
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,380
rich and powerful.

601
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,730
He came from poor roots

602
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,290
and his parents are gone.

603
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,700
But he is a better choice

604
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,570
than Tongxin.

605
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,180
Erniu,

606
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,250
still leaning on men?

607
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,420
Who else can I depend on

608
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,570
if not men?

609
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,660
Women don't need men
to find their way forward!

610
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,900
What other choice do I have?

611
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,330
Maybe this is my best choice.

612
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,180
But he belongs to Qing Gang.

613
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,420
I fear he might harm you.

614
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,810
Don't worry.

615
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,140
On this path,

616
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,770
with or without men,

617
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,770
I stay true to myself.

618
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,530
As long as I'm being heartless,

619
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,290
no one can truly hurt me.

620
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,700
I'm leaving now.

621
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,180
Take care.

622
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,940
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

623
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,250
Not at all!

624
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,730
Please, get in the car.

[Shanghai Hospital]
Just for wretched Bai,

626
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,180
you tried to kill yourself.

627
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,380
You've utterly humiliated our family!

628
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,820
What happened?

629
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,740
You're here just in time.

630
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:37,740
Curse him out for me!

631
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,770
Talk sense into him!

632
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,370
Tongxin,

633
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,260
I thought you loved each other!

634
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,050
How come you broke up suddenly?

635
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,050
I have no idea.

636
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,530
She has toyed with him

637
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,610
and the Tian family.

638
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,980
How dare she oppose Tian's Apothecary!

639
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,420
Who is backing her?

640
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,610
I don't care.

641
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,570
If she opposes us, I'll crush her.

642
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,770
Don't, Tongdao!

643
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,530
Come on! Show some backbone already!

644
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,220
But I like her.

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,530
Tongxin,

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,090
don't act like this!

right?

651
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,740
Why cling so stubbornly to her,

652

right?

653
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,740
I refuse.

Why don't you just kill yourself?

Fine.

what did you just say?

663
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,260
You said there is someone

664
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,260
identical to Wretched Bai.

665
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,770
Yes.

with Bai Bingxin.

you mentioned?

Why are you

684
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,180
asking about her?

I want to find her

to disgust Wretched Bai.

687
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,420
And to cool my jets.

00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,500
Better drop it.

with her again.

Mr. Wen,

705
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,220
why are you suddenly so generous?

706

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,700
Oh, give me a break!

708
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,770
I want you to gladly dedicate to work.

709
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,180
As long as the paycheck

710

So that's your angle.

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,420
Pretty smart, huh?

716

I'll inquire through other channels.

Don't you know

why they were seized?

We have no idea.

Someone reported you,

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,530
accusing Wen's Pharmacy

734
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,810
of openly trading in herbs,

735
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,180

That's absolutely impossible!

A simple investigation

How long will it take?

At best, six months.

742

At worst, three to five years.

743
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,700
That means

for at least six months?

I can't tell you that.

Since someone reported,

752
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,130
he wouldn't do that blindly.

753
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,530
He must have shown evidence.

The report counts as evidence.

According to your logic,

00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,260
you can just seize the goods.

Fine then.

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,560
[Wanted: Jin Handing & Huang Yucheng]

763
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,500
Sir!

764
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,530
I want to report.

765
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,500
Report what?

766
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,740
He's in cahoots

767
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,330
with Jin Handing and Huang Yucheng!

768
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,700
Don't speak groundlessly.

769
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,900
He knows exactly

770
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,810
where they are hiding.

771
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,660
That could get me killed!

772
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,810
Arrest him first.

773
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,940
Investigate him for six months.

774
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,570
Don't listen to her.

775
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,940
She's talking nonsense!
No evidence at all.

776
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,660
The report counts as evidence.

777
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,020
Young lady,

778
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,940
what are you trying to do?

779
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,020
I just want to know

780
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,980
why you're seizing our goods
for no reason.

781
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,810
Let me be frank with you.

782
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,980
I have no idea about that.

783
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,260
Mr. Wang instructed us to do that.

784
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,130
We're just carrying out orders.

785
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:39,940
We have no choice.

786
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,770
Mr. Wang?

787
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,660
Yes.

788
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,370
You can't just meet Mr. Wang
as you like.

789
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,220
I have urgent business

790
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,420
to consult with him personally.

791
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,420
No.

792
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,460
Please kindly deliver my message.

793
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,220
I don't have time.

794
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,740
Come on, sir.

795
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,130
Sir.

796
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,220
Mr. Wang.

797
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,020
Good day, Mr. Wang.

798
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,740
I'm Chu Shaohua,
General Manager of Wen's Pharmacy.

799
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,740
Mr. Wang,

800
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,740
you look pale,

801
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,810
with swelling under your eyes

802
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,850
and ashen lips.

803
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,570
Have you been experiencing
frequent dizziness,

804
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,770
weakness in the lower back and knees

805
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,940
and cold extremities lately?

806
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,770
Talking nonsense!

807
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,530
Do you often have trouble
falling asleep,

808
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,570
get up frequently at night

809
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,940
and are struggle with sexual affairs?

810
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,220
Stop!

811
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,260
Or I'll arrest you!

812
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,740
Please calm down.

813
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,180
That stems from weakened vital fire.

814
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,490
You need to tonify your middle jiao
and boost qi,

815
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,530
as well as nourish essence
and replenish marrow.

816
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,050
Wen's Pharmacy's Jinkui Shenqi Pill

817
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,770
works wonders for your symptoms!

818
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,980
Take it for three consecutive days,

819
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,610
your condition will greatly improve.

820
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,500
Additionally, our Oriental Bunao Pill

821
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,740
can instantly relieve your dizziness.

822
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,130
Mr. Wang,

823
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,850
give them a try.

824
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,130
You're from Wen's Pharmacy.

825
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,940
Yes, here's my business card.

826
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,090
Mr. Wang,

827
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,050
we have a batch of finished medicine

828
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,220
called Oriental Bunao Pill.

829
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,420
This very one.

830
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,420
Your subordinates seized it.

831
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,900
They insisted it was smuggled opium!

832
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,770
We're wronged!

833
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,770
That's why I come here at once

834
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,020
to see you

835
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,610
for an opportunity to appeal.

836
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,460
We'll know if you're wronged

837
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,740
once our investigation concludes.

838
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,570
You may return and await notification.

839
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,130
How long will it take?

840
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,290
Just three to five days, I suppose.

841
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,090
That's wonderful news!

842
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,130
Mr. Wang, thank you so much!

843
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,420
I won't take up any more of your time.

844
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,020
Alright.

845
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,500
Thank you.

846
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,290
Mr. Wang,

847
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,980
remember to take the pills.

848
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:44,940
Alright.

849
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,500
See you.

850
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,660
[Wen's Pharmacy]

851
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,610
[Manager's Office]
Tomorrow, bring him

852
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,770
more Jinkui Shenqi Pill
and Oriental Bunao Pill.

853
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,460
Also, strengthen the relationship.

854
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,980
Hope for the best.

855
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,940
That won't work. I've learned

856
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,050
Mr. Tian is the one behind all this.

857
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,210
Mr. Tian?

858
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,020
The Tian family

859
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,650
is connected
to Songhu Police Department.

860
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,980
So after Wang Guodong took office,

861
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,460
Mr. Tian poured a lot into him.

862
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,860
By seizing our goods,

863
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,340
he is taking revenge on us.

864
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,380
What did Mr. Xia say?

865
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,900
He reached out to a few industry peers.

866
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,900
But all the connections

867
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,610
he secured were
on Lu Yongxiang's side.

868
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,650
Wang Guodong answers to Qi Xieyuan,

869
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,020
disregarding Lu Yongxiang.

870
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,050
How intriguing!

871
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,500
I even turned

872
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,500
to a friend of Wang Guodong for help

873
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,300
to invite Wang Guodong to dinner.

874
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,860
But he's so arrogant,

875
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,860
so hard to get a hold of him.

876
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,090
Hello!

877
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,340
Yunlong!

878
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,090
We were just talking about you.

879
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,170
Yeah.

880
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,860
Alright, got it.

881
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,650
Thanks!

882
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,250
Wang Guodong

883
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,610
agreed to come out for dinner.

884
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,170
Really?

885
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,170
But

886
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,940
he requested that you join him.

887
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,250
Me?

888
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,530
You know what?

889
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,730
Oriental Bunao Pill works wonders!

890
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,860
Last night I took a whole bottle

891
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,940
of the pills you gave me,

892
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,020
my condition improved dramatically.

893
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,610
That's wonderful news!

894
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,980
Mr. Wang,

895
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,610
alleviating patients' suffering

896
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,610
is precisely the founding principle

897
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,940
of Wen's Pharmacy.

898
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,380
Yes, ever since we opened our doors,

899
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,780
we've always adhered

900
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,050
to our ancestors' teachings.

901
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:02,050
Smuggling opium is something

902
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,340
we would never do.

903
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,730
Mr. Wang, please take a look.

904
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,460
Here are the contracts signed

905
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,420
with several Suzhou merchants
for that batch of goods,

906
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,420
along with the payment receipts,

907
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,130
warehouse dispatch records,

908
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,940
the packing records

909
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,050
and contracts with
the freight forwarder.

910
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,050
By comparing with physical things,

911
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,780
you'll see

912
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,050
the opium smuggling allegations

913
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,860
are completely baseless!

914
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,780
With these vague claims

915
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,210
and a few documents,

916
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,740
you expect me to fully trust you?

917
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,690
I'm afraid that's simply impossible.

918
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,420
No.

919
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,130
Over 20 apothecaries
of Shanghai TCM Guild

920
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,650
stand ready to testify on our behalf.

921
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,250
Yes.

922
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,130
This is impossible, isn't it?

923
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,780
Mr. Wang,

924
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,340
if that's your final decision,

925
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,570
we must close forever.

926
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,610
Not really.

927
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,860
You have no idea.

928
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,170
To open this apothecary,

929
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,610
Mr. Wen mortgaged all his assets,

930
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,050
and took on massive debts.

931
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,380
After great efforts,

932
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,050
Oriental Bunao Pill just
opened up an outlet.

933
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,130
But

934
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,420
such an absurd incident happened.

935
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,460
If we can't retrieve the goods,

936
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,860
Mr. Wen

937
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,500
has to beg for food on Nanjing Road.

938
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,900
And I

939
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,340
will lose my job.

940
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,130
You'll also have to suffer?

941
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,980
I absolutely won't allow that.

942
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,250
Mr. Wang,

943
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,530
please show us some mercy

944
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,530
and let our goods go.

945
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,210
Ms. Chu,

946
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,300
let me tell you frankly.

947
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,780
By acting pitiful

948
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,610
and miserable,

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,380
you will never

950
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,340
get your goods back.

951
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,570
Yes, exactly as I said.

952
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,170
Right.

953
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,210
Finally Mr. Wang

954
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,500
dines with us,

955
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,780
but we've been discussing work.

956
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,730
Mr. Wang,

957
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,730
I raise my glass to you!

958
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,570
Yunlong couldn't

959
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,090
make it back this time,

960
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,090
so he asked me to raise a toast
in his place.

961
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,690
Yunlong is your friend?

962
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,170
Yes.

963
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,940
Then you are also my friend.

964
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,610
It's nothing.

965
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,130
Let's have a drink.

966
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,020
Thank you, Mr. Wang!

967
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,900
Thank you!

968
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,820
Please give us more support!

969
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,420
Yunlong and I were classmates
at Beifang Police Academy.

970
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,500
Since he's spoken up,

971
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,900
I can hardly turn down his request.

972
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,250
But speaking of that,

973
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,610
upon closer reflection,

974
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,170
I found our schoolmate connection

975
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,050
won't carry enough weight.

976
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,820
Then

977
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,900
what if I add this?

978
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,940
Actually,

979
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,530
it's not that complicated.

980
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,020
If you want your goods back,

981
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,610
just agree to one condition from me.

982
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,380
Please tell us what it is.

983
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,980
If you become

984
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,500
my eighth concubine,

985
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,820
I'll release the goods immediately.

986
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,610
I…

987
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,460
You must be joking!

988
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,170
He is surely making a joke.

989
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,340
Mr. Wang,

990
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,940
making jokes calls for a penalty drink!

991
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,500
But I never joke.

992
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,940
I'm completely serious.

993
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,690
In this case,

994
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,690
I'll give you my serious reply.

995
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,340
That's impossible.

996
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,530
I believe

997
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,380
nothing is impossible in my world.

998
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,460
You old rascal!

999
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,210
Wait!

1000
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,250
Hold on a second.

1001
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,900
Mr. Wang, look at her.

1002
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,570
She has a quick temper.

1003
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,530
Alright.

1004
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,530
Put it down.

1005
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,460
I like her quick temper.

1006
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,500
That's interesting.

1007
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
- Old pervert!
- Easy. Easy.

1008
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,380
Rascal!

1009
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,530
You weak old man!

1010
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,050
Chu Shaohua.

1011
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,500
Let go.

1012
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,020
Wait a moment.

1013
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,170
Mr. Wang,

1014
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,090
if you fancy this type,

1015
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,460
later I can find you two

1016
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,420
better than her.

1017
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,460
No.

1018
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,530
I insist on her.

1019
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,730
It's not appropriate.

1020
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,380
She

1021
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,170
has been married and had a child.

1022
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,050
This isn't good.

1023
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,980
Wen,

1024
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,980
let me tell you frankly.

1025
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,380
Among my seven concubines,

1026
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,130
there are students,

1027
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,980
actresses,

1028
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,980
but not a female manager yet.

1029
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,340
Make way.

1030
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,530
Chu Shaohua.

1031
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,090
Make way.

1032
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,690
Mr. Wang,

1033
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,610
I spoke recklessly just now,

1034
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,530
carried away by impulse.

1035
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,730
This drink here is my apology for that.

1036
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,500
Exactly.

1037
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,980
You were being disrespectful just now.

1038
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,250
You deserve it,

1039
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,500
right?

1040
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,300
A single glass won't do for an apology.

1041
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,380
At least a whole bottle!

1042
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,570
You're absolutely right.

1043
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,460
A full bottle as punishment!

1044
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,730
I'll drink it for her instead.

1045
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,210
No need. Give it to me.

1046
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,980
Chu...

1047
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,170
She is bold.

1048
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,020
The bolder you are, the more I like you.

1049
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,610
Mr. Wang,

1050
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,570
you see

1051
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,170
this is just my nature.

1052
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,380
What do you say?

1053
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,300
If you marry me,

1054
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,340
your household may be chaotic.

1055
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,780
No.

1056
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,380
The ladies in my household

1057
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,210
are all very virtuous.

1058
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,130
They'll surely treat you well.

1059
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,090
Impossible!

1060
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,380
A fortune-teller once said

1061
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,820
her fate is too strong.

1062
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,300
She brought misfortune to her father,

1063
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,570
and after she married,

1064
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,420
she brought death to her husband.

1065
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,210
Wonderful!

1066
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,050
The fortune-teller said

1067
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,940
I carry killing energy in my fate.

1068
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:33,050
A stronger woman can better support me.

1069
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,780
Mr. Wang,

1070
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,300
to be honest,

1071
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:39,860
I

1072
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,860
have a fiancé.

1073
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,340
You have a fiancé?

1074
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,610
Who is he?

1075
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,530
Him.

1076
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,460
