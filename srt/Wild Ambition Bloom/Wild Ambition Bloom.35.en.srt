Xia Yuan is really amazing.

He taught me a lot.

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,770
Don't you think he's doing this

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,260
just to drive a wedge

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,690
between us?

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,100
Is that what you think?

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,820
I thought you'd be happy for me.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,540
I am.

39
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,130
You always said

40
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,460
I should

41

make my own way

42

I'm heading that way now.

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,780
That's true.

46
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,690
I used to depend on you.

47
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,220
But now I can challenge you.

Erniu, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,220

to see how far you've come.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,570
That's great.

56
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,610
But seriously,

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,170
I'm really happy.

58

I used to not get

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,890
why you all had that gleam in your eyes

60
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,100
whenever you talked about business.

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,730
Now that I'm part of it, I finally get

62
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,100
why you were all so excited.

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,100
And honestly, it's a blast.

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,730
Nothing else

65
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,500
even comes close to that feeling.

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,540
You're right.

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,570
And let me warn you.

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,850
I admit I underestimated you before,

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,220
and that's why you caught me off guard.

70
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,850
But from now on,

71
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,940
I'm going to go all out.

Bring it on.

The best way to respect a rival

74
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,940
is to give it your all.

75

And

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,380
let's get one thing straight.

No matter how this battle ends,

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,820
we can't let it come between us.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,690
Of course.

80
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,690
Business is one thing.

81
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,010
Personal feelings are another.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,410
Why don't we have newspaper carriers

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,220
slip an ad flier

84
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,820
into every newspaper they sell?

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,660
We can pay them

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,980
one wen a piece.

87
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,730
It's a win-win. They make more money

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,980
and we get a huge boost
in brand awareness for the Miracle Pill.

89
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,610
It costs less than placing ads
the usual way.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,220
And it works better.

91
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,660
Should we adjust
the TCM apothecaries' rebates

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,290
and payment terms
to match the Yushu Pill's?

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,060
Rather than letting the profits
go to TCM apothecaries,

94
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,820
why not let our customers
benefit instead?

95
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,290
How?

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,250
Regulars of Miracle Pill

97
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,490
can get 10% off

98
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,340
with one empty bottle
when they repurchase.

99
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,930
Two bottles

100
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,610
mean 20% off,

101
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,540
and so on.

102
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,140
With ten empty bottles,

103
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,580
they get a free one.

104
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,660
Additionally,

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,730
regulars

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,900
who bring in new customers

107
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,780
get

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,290
a free bottle, too.

109
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,730
This way,

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,930
we retain existing customers

111
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,900
while attracting new ones.

112
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,250
I've crunched the numbers.

113
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,810
If 100 bottles are sold,

114
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,490
TCM apothecaries

115
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,290
earn more from Yushu Pill

116
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,930
than from Miracle Pill.

117
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,580
But when they sell 1,000 bottles,

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,700
Miracle Pill

119
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,900
earns them five times

120
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,250
more than Yushu Pill.

121
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,460
So even generous rebates
and payment terms

122
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,660
can't match the appeal
of fast-growing sales

123
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,700
to the owners.

124
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,140
It's a solid approach,

125
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,500
but easy to replicate.

126
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,900
I'd say

127
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,820
within a month,

128
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,940
Jujing Apothecary will follow suit.

129
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,340
It doesn't matter.

130
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,940
This strategy only works if the medicine

131
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,980
is truly effective.

132
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,220
Even if Jujing Apothecary
tries the same thing,

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,900
it won't work for them

134
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,420
without real results

135
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,700
from the Yushu Pill.

136
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,420
I have always been confident

137
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,500
in the efficacy of Miracle Pill.

138
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,220
Right.

139
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,380
The real battle starts now.

140
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,260
Miss Bai has signed exclusive agreements

141
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,860
with over 80 TCM apothecaries.

142
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,020
However,

143
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,540
more than 300 others

144
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,620
are open to us.

145
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,300
That's why the next week

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,340
is so critical.

147
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,980
We have to visit all of these

148
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,940
to distribute samples,
explain the efficacy,

149
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,700
and introduce our policies.

150
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,860
We'll divide everyone in the company

151
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,940
into teams of two,

152
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,020
with each team assigned
to a specific region.

153
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,820
As of today,

154
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,500
Yushu Pill has been stocked

155
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,180
in over 200 TCM apothecaries
in Shanghai.

156
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,300
And Miracle Pill?

157
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,500
Miracle Pill has been carried

158
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,860
in a little over 100 TCM apothecaries.

159
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,420
She can still fight back?

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,660
Sales may be picking up,

161
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,740
but the bigger picture
is still uncertain.

162
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,260
With a market as big as Shanghai's,

163
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,460
there's plenty of room

164
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,660
for both Yushu and Miracle Pills.

165
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,900
Absolutely not.

166
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,780
If Miracle Pill stays ahead,

167
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,780
everything I've planned falls apart.

168
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,820
What plan?

169
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,980
We've got one month

170
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,420
to take Miracle Pill out of the game.

171
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,900
This upcoming month

172
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,060
is crucial.

173
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,500
Unless we push back
against Jujing's aggressive campaign,

174
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,820
we'll be boxed out of the market
for good.

175
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,700
Yes.

176
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,140
If you can win over

177
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,420
one person,

178
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,580
dealing with Chu Shaohua
will be a whole lot easier.

179
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,900
Now

180
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,460
we can't beat

181
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,340
Jujing Apothecary on our own.

182
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,100
We need to seek new partners.

183
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,020
The question is, who?

184
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,740
It's time to let go of the past.

185
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,100
Shaohua, you probably don't know this,

186
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,140
but he's pretty much

187
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,500
out of the TCM business.

188
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,060
He kept one main store,

189
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,940
but all the other branches
were converted into trade houses.

190
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,260
They're mainly selling fabrics,
medical equipment,

191
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,420
salt, kerosene,

192
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,580
and other local specialties now.

193
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,860
I wasn't talking about him.

194
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,740
[Tian's Apothecary]

195
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,340
Looks like we're on the same page.

196
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,940
Let's get one thing clear.

197
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,580
Whoever gets to see Mr. Tian first,

198
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,060
no badmouthing each other.

199
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,860
We don't know who he's willing

200
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,940
to meet with yet.

201
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,540
Miss Chu, Miss Bai,

202
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,380
Mr. Tian would like to see you
in his office.

203
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,340
Please.

204
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,620
Please.

205
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,180
Let's see

206
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,100
who have come crawling to me today.

207
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,380
Mr. Tian.

208
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,860
Tongdao.

209
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,860
No,

210
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,500
I don't deserve it.

211
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,980
There's a clear gap

212
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,220
between us.

213
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,860
You don't measure up.

214
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,660
I just called you
what your brother does.

215
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,900
In my life,

216
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,260
there are

217
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,260
two things in life I truly despise.

218
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,900
One is you.

219
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,220
And the other is you.

220
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,620
You're

221
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,540
just a low-born wannabe,

222
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,820
scrambling for a seat at a table
you'll never belong to.

223
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,940
And you're

224
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,260
nothing but a devious plotter,

225
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
always scheming behind my back.

226
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,140
With the two of you?

227
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,300
Let's be honest.

228
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,420
Working with you?

229
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,460
Not a chance.

230
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,180
Tongdao, why let money
slip through your fingers?

231
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,220
Exactly.

232
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm a businessman, aren't I?

233
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,820
And businessmen don't say no to money.

234
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,460
So now I'm giving both of you a chance.

235
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,260
Start flattering me.

236
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,460
I'll cooperate

237
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,020
with whoever makes me happy.

238
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,380
Come on, butter me up.

239
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,780
Tongdao,

240
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,860
please take a look at this.

241
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,020
The prices,

242
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,140
payment terms, and rebates

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,620
are all in here.

244
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
It's an incredibly generous deal.

245
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,460
Just read it.

246
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,980
I promise you'll like it.

247
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,540
Your turn.

248
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,780
Flatter me.

249
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,660
Why would I do that?

250
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,380
I told you when I got here,

251
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,820
that I'm here to help.

252
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,380
Mr. Tian,

253
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,660
I can double your income

254
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,900
and bring back

255
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,940
your former glory.

256
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,900
But sorry,

257
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,420
we

258
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,260
don't do rebates,

259
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,260
price cuts,

260
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,580
or payment plans.

261
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,940
What we do offer

262
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,660
is a win-win partnership.

263
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,260
Tongdao,

264
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,220
all the terms I mentioned

265
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
are negotiable.

266
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,420
Miss Chu

267
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,660
already gave me
a cut of Miracle Pill's profits.

268
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,540
We can do the same.

269
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Miss Chu gave a full 10%.

270
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,820
We'll give 15%.

271
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,420
That's tempting.

272
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,620
Mr. Tian,

273
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,740
I don't think you want to make a deal.

274
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,020
You just want to sit back

275
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,060
and watch Miss Bai and me go at it.

276
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,540
You got it right.

277
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,660
Back then,

278
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,300
you pulled every trick in the book

279
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,780
just to embarrass me,

280
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,380
well, maybe just a little.

281
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,860
But still,

282
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,580
watching you two claw at each other now,

283
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,380
I've got to say I'm loving it.

284
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,300
Shaohua.

285
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,260
What are you doing?

286
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,700
With Jujing Apothecary backing her up,

287
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,700
I believe Miss Bai, even at a loss,

288
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
will offer

289
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,300
decent terms.

290
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,020
But she doesn't have anything
with this kind of effect.

291
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,780
Are you alright?

292
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm fine.

293
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,820
Such an incredible medicine.

294
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,780
Give me 15%, and I'll choose you.

295
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,100
I will never lower the price.

296
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,140
You may be annoying,

297
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,140
but you're no idiot.

298
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,260
I believe you'll go with

299
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,260
the partner

300
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,500
who offers real value,

301
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,580
not just a low price.

302
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,540
Also,

303
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,020
with the way the Japanese
are pushing us around right now,

304
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,740
I don't want us turning on each other.

305
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,820
I'd rather hurt myself

306
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,020
than go up against Miss Bai.

307
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,460
I'd rather walk away from this deal

308
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,940
than get into a price war with her.

309
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,380
Mr. Tian

310
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,820
not only agreed
to all of Chu Shaohua's terms,

311
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,220
but even put in extra capital

312
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,420
to become a shareholder
in Shaohua Pharmaceuticals?

313
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,420
Yes.

314
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,540
Chu Shaohua has now

315
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,700
found her footing in Shanghai.

316
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,220
I'm sorry

317
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,700
for failing the task.

318
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,060
Tell me,

319
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,180
where did you slip up this time?

320
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,100
When I entered,

321
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,740
I lowered myself too much.

322
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,540
It let Mr. Tian blow off steam,

323
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,740
but it also made him look down on me.

324
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,620
Did it ever occur to you

325
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,660
that Mr. Tian's anger

326
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,060
might've just been part
of his negotiation strategy?

327
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,340
You're saying

328
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,140
I misread what the negotiation
was really about?

329
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,780
And Chu Shaohua made the right call.

330
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,060
Honestly, the main reason

331
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,140
I lost this time

332
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,660
is that the Yushu Pill
just doesn't measure up

333
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,460
to the Miracle Pill's effect.

334
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,780
No.

335
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,580
That's not the problem.

336
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,940
You're

337
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
just not ruthless enough.

338
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,780
The most powerful people are the ones

339
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,700
who are toughest on themselves.

340
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,580
Look at Chu Shaohua.

341
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,260
She was ruthless even to herself

342
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,180
just to take you on.

343
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,860
And you actually thought

344
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,820
the two medicines
could share the market?

345
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,660
So next time

346
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,820
you face off with Chu Shaohua,

347
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,460
you'll make the right move, right?

348
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,260
[Chichun Apothecary]
I've come all this way.

349
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,620
What's the big deal
if I grab a few extra boxes?

350
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,980
Why not?

351
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,940
It's just for personal use.

352
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,380
There's plenty for everyone.

353
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,860
Just give them to me.

354
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,980
Miss Chu,

355
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,860
Tian's Apothecary just called.

356
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,940
They're out of stock again.

357
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
Ask Tong to contact the factory.

358
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,620
Okay.

359
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:40,940
Miss Chu.

360
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,140
Miss Chu,

361
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,820
when will you interview
the new recruits?

362
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,940
Wednesday.

363
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,500
Alright.

364
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,500
Move aside.

365
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,540
Miss Chu,

366
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,700
the printing factory
is delaying delivery again.

367
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,380
Then get a new supplier.

368
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:58,820
Alright.

369
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,260
Shaohua.

370
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,020
Ms. Shen.

371
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,380
Ms. Shen,

372
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
you don't need to queue up.

373
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,660
Just let one of our clerks know
when you arrive.

374
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,660
I kept my identity

375
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
from your staff

376
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,860
because I wanted to see

377
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,500

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,300
he's been acting pretty strange.

566
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,260
He sold his shops in Shanghai,

567
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,420
then opened branches
in Hong Kong, China, Shantou,

568
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,060
and Sanheba.

569
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,780
I even heard he plans

570
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,740
to expand to Dapu, Yongding,
Shanghang, and Tingzhou.

571
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,580
Isn't that just ridiculous?

572
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,660
I'm looking for Wen Zhiqiu.

573
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,300
Where is he?

574
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,940
Running an apothecary is tough.

575
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,780
Doing trade is way easier,

576
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,580
right?

577
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,500
If you have...

578
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,260
Zhiqiu.

579
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,820
She's

580
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
my former fiancée,

581
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,660
Miss Chu Shaohua.

582
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:35,660
I...

583
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,780
Didn't you say you were done with me?

584
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,260
Why the sudden visit?

585
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,740
Is something bothering you?

586
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,500
No.

587
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,100
- I...
- Then,

588
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,140
missing me, huh?

589
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,340
I'm not sure I can handle that.

590
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,660
If people start talking,

591
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,740
my whole reputation

592
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,260
is toast.

593
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
Do you really think
you have a good reputation?

594
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,380
Since we parted ways,

595
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,140
your foes have become my friends.

596
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,140
Things have really opened up for me.

597
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
Feels like I can breathe again.

598
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,620
Everything just flows now.

599
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,460

Wen Zhiqiu,

you're a disgrace.

Miss Chu,

627
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,220
you shared years of work

628
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,300
and a relationship.

629
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,620
Even if things fell apart,

630
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,500
those words were unnecessarily harsh.

631
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,100
- Exactly.
- Right.

632
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,540
Mr. Zhang,

633
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,020
if he had done to you

634
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,220
what he did to me,

635
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,940
I doubt you'd stop at harsh words.

636
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,340
You'd probably reach for a knife.

637
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,220
Mr. Wen,

638
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,860
what exactly did you do?

639
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,340
You should ask her what she did to me.

640
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,340
Wen Zhiqiu!

641
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,660
Don't let me see you again.

642
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,940
I'll curse you every time I see you.

643
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,900
You better pray
you never fall into my hands,

644
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,580
because I swear,
I'll make you wish you were dead.

645
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,220
Just focus on your business.

646
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,500
And make sure

647
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,460

648
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,820

Zhiqiu,

654
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,220
you've really got
to be more careful from now on.

655
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,380
Mr. Wen, all your goods are here.

656
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Would you like to inspect them?

657
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,500
Let me see.

658
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,900
This...

659
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,340
Let's check them.

660
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,060
When will they be loaded onto the ship?

661
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,020
Once the paperwork is done.

662
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,300
When will they arrive
in Hong Kong, China?

663
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:45,820
Around a week.

664
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,340
This batch of medicine is critical.

665
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,300
No errors can be allowed.

666
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,580
Don't worry.

667
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,260
We've been in this business for years.

668
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,620
We'd never mishandle a client's goods.

669
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,340
Where are the goods from the Manley?

670
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,060
Open all boxes for inspection.

671
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,060
This isn't in line with
the regulations, is it?

672
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,380
They've just been inspected.

673
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,980
We got a tip-off

674
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,940
that this batch of goods
arriving in Shanghai on the Manley

675
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,780
contains contraband.

676
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,660
We must thoroughly investigate.

677
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,900
They've all been inspected already.

678
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,740
Ensure everything is checked carefully.

679
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,340
Easy, these...

680
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,500
Inspect them thoroughly.

681
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,620
Careful, please.

682
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,900
These are fragile.

683
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,580
I'll take them out one by one

684
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,860
for you to check, alright?

685
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,780
Check these out.

686
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,300
See?

687
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,380
Look.

688
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,860
There, you see?

689
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,620
- That's all.
- Buddy.

690
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,860
These are good.

691
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,420
Look carefully.

692
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,620
That's enough.

693
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,380
Don't go too far.

694
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,700
No problem with the goods.

695
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,780
Let's check over there.

696
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,340
Let's go.

697
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,180
Come on.

698
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,580
Open the box.

753
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,460
We're planning to keep ordering it.

754
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,380
No problem.

755
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,660
Also,

756
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,980
we used to work with a trading house

757
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,380
to source Western medicine
from overseas.

758
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
However, they're currently unavailable.

759
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,140
Would it be possible to entrust
the procurement to you instead?

760
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,980
Yes.

761
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,460
Which medicines do you need?

762
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,260
The names and quantities
of the medicines

763
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,180
are all listed.

764
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,700
Once the medicines arrive in Shanghai,
please repackage them

765
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,300
to look like
regular Chinese patent remedies.

766
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,300
Understood.

767
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,300
I'll take my leave.

768
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,820
Okay.

769
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Take care.

770
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:24,780
[Miss Bai Bingxin's Birthday Ball]

771
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,340
Thanks, everyone.

772
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,220
Distinguished guests,

773
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,780
good evening.

774
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,620
Welcome to Miss Bai Bingxin's
Birthday Ball.

775
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Let's welcome tonight's guest of honor,

776
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,940
the lovely Miss Bai Bingxin,

777
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,500
to the stage.

778
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,860
Thank you very much.

779
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,860
Her outfit

780
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,420
must be worth
at least 100,000 silver dollars.

781
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,300
Yes.

782
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,060
And Xia Yuan paid for all of it.

783
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,660
Mrs. Xia is truly gracious.

784
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,100
She hasn't said a word about it
all these years.

785
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,300
May the ladies shine ever brighter,

786
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,020
and success follow every gentleman.

787
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,820
- Great.
- Wonderful.

788
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Now,

789
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,060
we're all wondering,

790
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,780
as the ball is about to begin,

791
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,540
who will Miss Bai share

792
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,580
her first dance with?

793
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,500
To show my gratitude,

794
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,820
I'll be auctioning off my first dance,

795
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,860
with all proceeds going to charity!

796
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,780
Miss Bai is gorgeous
and has a heart of gold.

797
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,980
And now, the auction

798
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,020
for Miss Bai Bingxin's first dance
at her birthday ball

799
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,220
officially begins.

800
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,140
The starting price is 50 silver dollars.

801
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,420
I bid 100 silver dollars!

802
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,900
Two hundred silver dollars!

803
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,020
Two hundred silver dollars, first call!

804
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500

805
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,940

Five hundred silver dollars!

807
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,260
Mr. Tan has bid 500 silver dollars.

808
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,220
Five hundred silver dollars for a dance?

809
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,860
He's truly crazy.

810
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,180
The truth is,

811
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,620
he's just head over heels for her.

812
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,980
Five hundred silver dollars.

813
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,660
One thousand silver dollars.

814
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,020
Now Mr. Xia bids 1,000 silver dollars.

815
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,780
Is there anyone willing to bid higher?

816
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,500
One thousand silver dollars,

817
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
first call.

818
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:33,180
One thousand silver dollars,
second call.

819
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,020
One thousand silver dollars, third...

820
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,900
Three thousand silver dollars.

821
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,940
Three thousand?

822
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Three thousand silver dollars.

823
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,460
How much?

824
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,500
Three thousand silver dollars.

825
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,820
Three thousand silver dollars,
first call.

826
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,940
Three thousand silver dollars,
second call.

827
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,860
Three thousand silver dollars,
third call.

828
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,100
I declare

829
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,620
Miss Bai Bingxin's first dance tonight

830
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,300
belongs to this lady.

831
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,540
Miss,

832
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,780
please share a few words.

833
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,860
I'll keep it simple.

834
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,340
I hope all the proceeds

835
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,620
will be donated

836
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,340
to the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital,

837
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,740
to help rebuild the ward that was bombed

838
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,820
by the Japanese.

839
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,020
Thank you.

840
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,860
Thank you, Miss,

841
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,300
and Miss Bai Bingxin.

842
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,740
You look stunning.

843
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,020
I starved myself for three days

844
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,540
just to fit into this dress.

845
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,020
Is today really your birthday?

846
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,500
Of course not.

847
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,660
I don't even deserve

848
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,900
to exist,

849
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,860
let alone know the day
I came into this world.

850
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,060
Next, I announce...

851
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,940
Then why did you choose today?

852
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
It was a random choice.

853
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,900
I just wanted to hear people say

854
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,620
"Happy Birthday" to me.

855
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,380
We haven't seen each other in ages.

856
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,780
Let's take today as a chance

857
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,020
to really catch up.

858
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,340
Okay.

859
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,860
Let's go.

860
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,140
Where to?

861
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,020
I'll take you out
for something delicious.

862
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,420
No dancing?

863
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,980
What's the point of this dance?

864
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,980
There are still so many people here.

865
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,260
With all these people around,

866
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,420
can you really expect

867
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,900
a sincere "Happy Birthday"?

868
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,420
Let's go.

869
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,020
Like I said, you can leave
whenever you want.

870
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,500
We don't need
to care about those people.

871
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,300
Erniu,

872
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,620
there are many guests
hoping to see you dance.

873
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,180
Let's go.

874
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,060
Shaohua,

875
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,580
do you remember

876
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,180
the last time we walked through

877
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,460
the Medicine Market in Qizhou
when we were kids?

878
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,100
I do.

879
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,180
Do you remember

880
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,260
what we said when we met Xia Yuan

881
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,060
that time?

882
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,460
Shaohua,

883
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,540
look at her.

884
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,300
Her dress has gold embroidery
on the edges.

885
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,940
Her earrings

886
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,820
sparkle with giant gems,

887
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,700
and even her ring

888
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,460
is jeweled.

889
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,380
If I ever got to wear something
like that,

890
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,220
I'd die happy.

891
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,540
My outfit

892
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,780
is way more luxurious
than Mrs. Xia's was back then.

893
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,260
And you're

894
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
on equal footing

895
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,340
with someone like Xia Yuan now.

896
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,020
So, it seems

897
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,340
both of us have

898
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,980
realized our childhood dreams.

899
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,740
Are you satisfied?

900
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,460
Of course not.

901
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,380
Me neither.

902
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,940
What else do you want?

903
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,780
Could it be...

904
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,300
you want to be Mrs. Xia?

905
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,540
You'll find out soon enough.

906
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,100
[In Celebration
of Miss Bai Bingxin's Birthday]

907
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,780
Erniu.

908
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,500
Happy Birthday.

909
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,780
Miss Chu,

910
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:38,860
please stay.

911
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,460
I came here today just for you.

912
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,180
Sorry, I have something else
to take care of.

913
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,460
Miss Chu,

914
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,500
I came today just for you.

915
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,900
What do you want?

916
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,180
Miss Chu,

917
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,500
have you considered

918
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,580
selling Miracle Pill

919
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,220
and other TCM remedies

920
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,460
overseas?

921
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,020
Of course I have.

922
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,700
But I will not cooperate
with the Japanese.

923
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,940
Miss Chu,

924
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,460
I'm aware that the topic
of Sino-Japanese friendship

925
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,460
draws considerable opposition,

926
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,740
and I understand how you feel.

927
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,860
But please

928
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,620
don't be so quick to turn me down.

929
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,900
Take a moment to look over
the cooperation terms

930
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,300
we prepared for you.

931
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,220
I believe you'll find them

932
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,580
both compelling and sincere.

933
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,300
No need.

934
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,420
Mr. Komura,

935
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,340
your army

936
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,900
is invading our territory.

937
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,020
How could I possibly

938
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,540
cooperate with you?

939
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,220
Miss Chu,

940
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,620
cooperating with us
isn't just a way out,

941
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,820
but also a path to survival.

942
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,420
Are you threatening me?

943
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,340
Let me remind you, Miss Chu.

944
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,260
You Chinese

945
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,420
may be brave in personal fights,

946
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,900
but shrink from public battles.

947
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,780
If we concentrate our superior forces,

948
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,980
your army will be crushed

949
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,820
within three months.

00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,180
Miss Chu,

952
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,900
you should see this coming

953
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,740
and plan accordingly.

954
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,660
Mr. Komura,

955
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,460
if war between China and Japan
is inevitable,

956
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,180
the outcome is certain.

957
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,460
China will prevail.

958
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,860
That's my prediction.

959
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,140
And by the way,

960
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,660
your tie is crooked.

Qiu from Chahar was dragged out

965
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,820
and killed in the street.

966
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,260
