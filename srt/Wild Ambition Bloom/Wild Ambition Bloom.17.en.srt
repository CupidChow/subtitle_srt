00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,100
- Get her out of here.
- Country bumpkin!

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,170
Go crawl back to wherever you came from!

191
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,980
Shameless!

192
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,250
Take her away!

193
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,460
Now!

194
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,700
I won't let you off the hook!

195
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,140
Fighting in front of customers?

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,050
How disgraceful.

197
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,410
It wasn't a fight.

198
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,540
She hit me

199
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,610
for no reason at all.

200
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,540
She sent someone to seduce my boyfriend.

201
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,220
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

202
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,460
I don't even know your boyfriend.

203
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,810
Can you stop pretending already?

204
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,290
I've looked into everything.

205
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,060
You and that actress Bai Bingxin

206
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,340
share a room.

207
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:33,940
I...

208
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,700
Enough!

209
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,300
No matter the reason,

210
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,700
anyone who hits someone
must be punished.

211
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,730
According to our policy,

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,460
Ni Xiangying, you will receive
a formal warning.

213
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,610
Your salary and bonus
for this month will be deducted.

214
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,850
So she gets to stay,

215
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,100
and I get punished?

216
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,130
This whole thing is your fault.

217
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,300
I want to speak to Mr. Ma.

218
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,060
This is his decision.

219
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,650
Impossible.

220
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,250
Fine, ask him yourself.

221
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,650
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

222
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,220
Don't mention it.

223
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,940
Just doing my job.

224
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,980
Alright, I'll get back to work.

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,130
Go ahead.

226
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,730
What are you guys doing?

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,700
Bai's got a new movie coming out.

228
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,610
I'm helping her promote it.

229
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,420
Almost done.

230
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,060
Yeah.

231
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:25,980
Oh right.

232
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,010
I've got one last question

233
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,980
for you.

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,820
Sure, go ahead.

235
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,340
Miss Bai,

236
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,980
do you have any expectations

237
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,220
for your future boyfriend?

238
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,820
Are you asking

239
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,730
as the reporter,

240
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,820
or as my friend?

241
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,700
As the reporter.

242
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,820
Then I have only one answer:

243
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,060
Love me

244
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,250
like crazy.

245
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,130
And if I'm asking as a friend?

246
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,060
Money. Tons of it.

247
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,060
Any more questions?

248
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,490
That's it for today.

249
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,060
Let me treat you to a late-night snack.

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,580
No need.

251
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,100
I've got to rush back
and finish my article.

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,850
Thanks for your effort.

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,700
Alright.

254
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm off.

255
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,660
Take care.

256
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,100
Bye.

257
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,740
Take care.

258
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,780
Busy day?

259
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,140
It was alright.

260
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,940
Do you think he likes you?

261
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,180
Maybe.

262
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,820
Don't you want to give him a chance?

263
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,060
I haven't met him much,

264
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,820
but he seems like a pretty decent guy.

265
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
He's not just nice.

266
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,260
He's amazing.

267
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,020
Honest, kind,

268
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,060
a brilliant writer,

269
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,700
and he treats me so well.

270
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,140
But he can't give me
what I'm looking for.

271
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,580
I don't want to hold him back.

272
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
What happened to your face?

273
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,980
Before we get to that,

274
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,500
what's going on with you and Mr. Tian?

275
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,220
You know,

276
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,980
we just started seeing each other,

277
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,220
so I didn't tell you.

278
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,220
His girlfriend is Ni Xiangying,

279
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,380
who's also my colleague.

280
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
That slap I got

281
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
was because of this whole mess.

282
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,940
She thought I told you to do it.

283
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
That crazy woman
must be out of her mind!

284
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,740
Shaohua, don't worry.

285
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,820
I'll make sure

286
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,420
she pays for it.

287
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:05,940
Forget it.

288
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,660
No way.

289
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,220
We're not letting that slap slide.

290
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,380
Of course

291
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,900
I'd hit back.

292
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,340
But I found out a secret.

293
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,740
When I grabbed her wrist today,

294
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,380
I realized she might be pregnant.

295
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,940
She's expecting?

296
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,580
So Erniu, let me give you some advice.

297
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,500
Stop seeing Mr. Tian.

298
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,380
I can walk away anytime.

299
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,620
It's him who can't let go of me.

300
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Even if he's still clinging to you,

301
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,100
that doesn't mean he truly loves you.

302
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,100
Maybe you were just a conquest to him.

303
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,900
I know.

304
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,740
So you're still going to date him?

305
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,540
He sees me as a conquest.

306
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,500
I see him as one too.

307
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,540
What if one day,

308
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,620
after finding someone new,

309
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,740
he treats you
the same way he treated Ni Xiangying

310
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,860
and just tosses you aside?

311
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,940
Then I'd better hold on tighter.

312
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,140
I need to get what I want

313
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,340
before he walks away from me.

314
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,300
What is it that you want?

315
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,940
I want to stay warm and fed.

316
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Not to be bullied, humiliated,

317
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,420
or stepped on.

318
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,180
I want to make it to the top.

319
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,020
But you could earn

320
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,340
all of that yourself.

321
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
By myself?

322
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,100
That's way too hard,

323
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,700
and I don't have time to wait.

324
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,140
After slaving away

325
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,620
at that department store
for a whole month,

326
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,540
how much do you even make?

327
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,340
And look at me.

328
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,380
I had just one meal with Mr. Tian,

329
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,180
and he bought me this,

330
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,340
worth over 100 silver dollars.

331
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,340
It only took four hours in total.

332
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,020
Sure, I struggle for what I have,

333
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,300
but it makes me feel secure.

334
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,060
Erniu, the path you're on now

335
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,820
won't necessarily lead
where you want to go.

336
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,860
You won't always get to
choose how it ends.

337
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,980
Just look at Ni Xiangying.
She's the warning sign.

338
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,820
But I still want to give it a try.

339
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,340
I just worry you'll regret it someday.

340
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,060
Then I'll deal with it
when that day comes.

341
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,780
Erniu.

342
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,140
What a crazy woman she is.

343
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,940
Why would she hit so hard?

344
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,780
She should start acting

345
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,540
like a mother for her baby's sake.

346
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,780
Oh right.

347
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,140
Her pulse

348
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,380
felt a little unstable.

349
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,860
Do you think
I should say something to her?

350
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,420
You just got slapped.

351
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,540
After what she did,

352
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,140
don't get involved.

353
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,660
[Western Medicine Department]
Welcome.

354
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,500
Ms. Shen.

355
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,900
Please, have a seat.

356
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,540
Alright.

357
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,540
The Finance Department
just released the report.

358
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,260
Due to the success of Guanpu,

359
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,140
our sales this month

360
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,580
tripled compared to last month.

361
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,340
That's great.

362
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,740
What about me and Ni Xiangying?

363
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,100
This month you sold

364
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,180
243 units,

365
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,460
for a total of 356 dollars.

366
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,580
Ni Xiangying sold...

367
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,500
272 units,

368
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,740
totaling 420 dollars.

369
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,060
I failed anyway.

370
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,100
You've done really well.

371
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,860
But according to our agreement...

372
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,180
I lost, fair and square.

373
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,500
I'm out.

374
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,820
So you're here
to grab your stuff and beat it, right?

375
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,100
Zhu Sha, are you leaving?

376
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,340

OK.

What's going on?

399
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,060
Let me introduce someone.

400
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,180
This is our new assistant
for the Floor Services Department,

401
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,180
Zhu Sha.

402
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,020
Wasn't she supposed to leave?

403
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,460
I did say whoever lost would leave,

404
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,780
but I never said where.

405
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,580
Zhu Sha's sales last month

406
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,980
were indeed lower than Ni Xiangying's.

407
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,620
But she proposed
the Guanpu-style stationery promotion,

408
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,060
which significantly boosted

409
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,620
the entire Stationery Department's sales.

410
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,060
As it happens,

411
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,340
Ms. Huang just resigned.

412
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,180
So the company has decided
to make an exception

413
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,740
and promote Zhu Sha.

414
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,740
So you got promoted?

415
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,860
That's great.

It's from Tongxin?

Yes.

was never meant to last.

I only wish you peace.

Should we get her

561
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,860
tell me to scram, wretch?

562
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,420
What a joke.

563
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,380
A senator? Please.

564
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,660
You're just a filthy john

565
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,060
who doesn't keep his word.

566
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,180
See? That's ridiculous!

567
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,900
You're way out of line.

568
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,140
We were just talking
about the news from Peking.

569
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,860
Tian,

570
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,380
who've you brought this time?

571
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Come on, introduce her to everyone.

572
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Let me do the honors.

573
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,340
This is my girlfriend,

574
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,220
Miss Bai Bingxin, a film star.

575
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,540
A film star, huh?

576
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,740
Tongxin,

577
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,180
I feel like

578
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,820
I've seen her before.

579
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,020
Of course she looks familiar.

580
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,540
She's done a few films.

581
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,260
Yeah.

582
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,060
Bingxin, let me introduce them to you.

583
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
This is Mr. Zhou.
I've been telling you all about him.

584
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
And his wife, Mrs. Zhou.

585
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,180
This is Jack,

586
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,420
and his fiancée, Daisy.

587
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,500
Then we have Gu,

588
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,860
Li,

589
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,940
Fei,

590
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,780
and Fei's wife, Mrs. Chen.

591
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,180
Nice to meet you all.

592
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Come on. Take a seat.

593
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,340
Come on, Bingxin.

594
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,100
Miss Bai,

595
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,420
where are you from?

596
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,580
I'm not from around here.

597
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,180
Have you ever

598
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,900
lived in Peking?

599
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,860
No, I've never been.

600
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,700
Really?

601
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,340
Do you have any family in Peking?

602
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,580
That's strange.

603
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,460
What is it?

604
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,380
I met a young lady in Peking

605
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,980
who looks a lot like Miss Bai.

606
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,140
Didn't you say
whenever you go to Peking,

607
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,700
you just attend meetings and leave?

608
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,780
So how did you end up
meeting young ladies there?

609
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,620
No, Dai introduced us

610
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,220
when he came

611
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,300
with some friends.

612
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,820
I've only seen her a couple of times.

613
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,380
I bet most of the ladies Dai knows

614
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,740
are probably working girls.

615
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,740
Don't tell me you went with him

616
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,860
to those kinds of places too.

617
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,620
Of course not.

618
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,980
Dai and I went to proper restaurants

619
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,180
with friends.

620
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,020
You're saying they're really alike?

621
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,540
A spitting image.

622
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,220
Bingxin,

623
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,340
there's someone who looks just like you.

624
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,620
I'm so curious.

625
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,340
I've got to meet her.

626
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,340
Tian,

627
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,380
if you get to know that kind of woman,

628
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,300
Miss Bai might break up with you.

629
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,820
I was just joking.

630
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,580
Looks like everyone's here.

631
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,340
Shall we raise a glass?

632
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,460
Come on.

633
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,700
OK. Come on.

634
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,060
Cheers.

635
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,820
Cheers.

636
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,660
Let's have a toast.

637
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,340
What's wrong?

638
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,980
Shaohua,

639
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,220
the day we met at Linfang Pavilion

640
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,180
in Peking,

641
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,660
that madam hit me

642
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,180
because of a man called Mr. Zhou.

643
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,020
Do you still remember that?

644
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,860
I do.

645
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,340
I saw him today.

646
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,980
He's been appointed as a director.

647
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,740
He's also very close
with the Tian family.

648
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,100
Did he recognize you?

649
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,500
He did.

650
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,740
But I refused to admit it was me.

651
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,660
His wife was there too.

652
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,180
So he didn't dare ask too much.

653
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,980
But he got suspicious.

654
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,620
Mr. Tian also started suspecting me.

655
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,700
This is tricky.

656
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,460
Yeah.

657
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,860
I worked so hard

658
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,780
to get here.

659
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,180
If they find out

660
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,620
that I'm Lu Ningxiang,

661
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,660
not only will Mr. Tian not marry me,

662
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,460
but I won't be able
to make it in Shanghai either.

663
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,820
Shaohua,

664
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,580
help me figure something out.

665
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I can't let them know

666
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,180
that I'm Lu Ningxiang from back then.

667
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,780
Shaohua, you're so smart.

668
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,780
Your mind works so fast.

669
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,380
Help me come up with a plan.

670
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,580
You said

671
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,500
because his wife was there,

672
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,980
he didn't press further.

673
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,700
Is he afraid of his wife?

674
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,300
Mr. Tian once told me

675
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,860
his post

676
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,460
was secured
through his wife's family connections.

677
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,620
Mr. Zhou?

678
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,260
Wait a second.

679
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,220
Are you talking about this guy?

680
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,700
Yes, that's the one.

681
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,700
Known for his integrity
and incorruptibility, can Zhou Jieren

682
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,780
end the corruption in the Division
of Industry and Commerce?

683
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,060
The public is watching
with anticipation.

684
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,140
[Live Simply, Stand Upright.]
They call extravagance flair,

685
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,660
and indulgence refinement.

686
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,460
But if this goes on unchecked,

687
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,180
the livelihood of the people
and the fate of the nation

688
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,980
will collapse.

689
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,580
I'm not the most capable,

690
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,700
but I stand with integrity

691
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,420
and walk with honor.

692
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,220
I stand against all that is rotten
without compromise.

693
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,300
Mr. Zhou.

694
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,020
You've truly spoken for the people.

695
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,740
Since they place such trust in me,

696
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,220
I will never let them down.

697
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,420
Mr. Zhou.

698
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,660
You go ahead.

699
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,540
- Okay.
- Alright.

700
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,340
Long time no see.

701
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,060
You've lost some weight.

702
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,820
- Let's go.
- Where's your gut?

703
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,300
What are you doing here?

704
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,780
I came to see you.

705
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,900
Didn't you go back home and get married?

706
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,060
My husband

707
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,340
is not very bright.

708
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,620
I couldn't live like that.

709
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
So I left.

710
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,660
Why'd you come to Shanghai?

711
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,820
To see you.

712
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,580
I saw your photo in the newspaper.

713
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,460
It said you were giving a speech here.

714
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,380
Of course I had to come check it out.

715
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,860
Have you missed me all these years?

716
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
I've missed you so much.

717
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,860
Lu Ningxiang.

718
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,180
We haven't had anything to do
with each other in years.

719
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,660
What's this about?

720
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,940
You become a big shot
and forget your old friend?

721
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,620
Show some respect!

722
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,980
You've got to be kidding me.

723
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,740
What did you just say?

724
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,180
Back then, you were crying
and begging me

725
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,740
not to treat you with so much respect.

726
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,260
Lu Ningxiang,

727
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,140
drop the past

728
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,580
and stay away from me.

729
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,340
From now on,

730
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,980
we're strangers. Got it?

731
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,420
How can you be so heartless?

732
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,340
No one's around. Leave, now.

733
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,340
You want me to leave?

734
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Fifty silver dollars.

735
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,940
Fifty?

736
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,780
Or I'll tell them what happened
at Linfang Pavilion.

737
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,580
This is blackmail.

738
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,100
Exactly.

739
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,820
You think I won't call the police?

740
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,500
I believe you.

741
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,660
But the moment they take me in,

742
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
I'll go to the newspaper

743
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,260
and spill everything
about all your little hookups

744
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,060
and your twisted secrets.

745
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,340
Every last detail.

746
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,140
Think they'll be interested?

747
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,540
You wouldn't dare.

748
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,220
Your wife doesn't know
about this, does she?

749
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,180
Remind me again,
where does your family live?

750
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,060
Lu Ningxiang,

751
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,540
are you trying to ruin me?

752
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,180
No.

753
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,620
I'm a little broke right now.

754
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,700
Come on.

755
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,220
What exactly do you want?

756
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Fifty silver dollars.

757
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,060
But...

758
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,420
Give me fifty,

759
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,140
and I'll keep your secret.

760
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,700
I don't have that much on me.

761
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,020
A director like you can't spare fifty?

762
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,180
I swear I'm not lying.

763
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,180
All my money's with my wife.

764
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,900
Fine.

765
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,100
I'll figure something out.

766
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,340
I'll go to the newspaper.

767
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,340
They'll pay me well for the story.

768
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,500
Wait.

769
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,380
I just need a little time.

770
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,140
Now.

771
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,420
No, Ningxiang.

772
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,180
Just for the sake of what we once had,

773
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
give me a week.

774
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,460
Just one week.

775
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,700
I'll get the money and give it to you.

776
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,620
Three days.

777
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,300
If you don't have it in three days,

778
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,100
you'll regret it.

779
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,180
Fine.

780
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,780
See you in a few days.

781
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,860
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

782
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,820
[The Shun Pao's Newspaper Office]

783
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,580
Tongxin, welcome.

784
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Take a seat.

785
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,380
Tongxin, perfect timing.

786
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,660
I was just about to ask you something.

787
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,860
About Miss Bai Bingxin,
the one who came to our gathering

788
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,900
last time,

789
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,300
how long have you two known each other?

790
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,500
Why bring her up all of a sudden?

791
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,580
To be honest,

792
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,260
ever since I met her,

793
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,620
something's been

794
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,460
nagging at me.

795
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,820
I met a working girl

796
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,220
in Peking

797
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,500
who looks just like her.

798
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,260
How alike are they?

799
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,940
They're

800
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,500
practically identical.

801
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,060
Actually,

802
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,340
this is also why I came here today.

803
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,300
What's on your mind?

804
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,780
Since I started seeing her,

805
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,300
I've asked her about her past,

806
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,100
but she always dodges my questions.

807
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,460
Well,

808
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,900
when you become friends with someone,

809
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,500
their background shouldn't matter.

810
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,020
But if she really comes
from that kind of past,

811
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,740
I'll have to think twice

812
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,140
about how close we should be.

813
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,180
Alright then.

814
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,300
I'll arrange another dinner.

815
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,580
Just you, me, and her.

816
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,340
She didn't tell me who else was coming.

817
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,020
But I called the restaurant.

818
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,860
They said it's a table for three.

819
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,180
Does that work for you?

820
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,660
Sure.

821
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,620
They ordered Huaiyang cuisine,

822
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,980
and a bottle of Riesling white wine.

823
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,900
Those are

824
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Mr. Zhou's favorites
back when he was in Peking.

825
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,620
I suppose

826
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,020
he'll probably be there tonight.

827
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,100
How about tonight?

828
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,340
I'll need a hand.

829
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,420
No problem. I'll take care of that.

830
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,460
That'll be enough.

831
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,780
Mr. Zhou.

832
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,180
Mr. Zhou.

833
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,100
Why didn't you tell me
Mr. Zhou would be here?

834
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,460
If I had known you were coming,

835
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,660
I would've brought
a nice bottle of wine.

836
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,580
Please excuse my forwardness.

837
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,540
It's not Tongxin's fault.

838
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,580
I reached out to him at the last minute,

839
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,540
and he mentioned
he was hosting you here tonight.

840
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,060
So I took the liberty

841
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,820
of coming over.

842
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,300
It's okay.

843
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,740
You're our honored guest.

844
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,010
We're just thrilled you could join us.

845
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Please have a seat, Miss Bai.

846
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Come on.

847
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,820
Mr. Zhou is such a gentleman.

848
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,780
Look at you. He's really outshone you.

849
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,900
Oh, that's very kind of you.

850
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,620
I'm simply old-school.

851
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Tongxin

852
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,060
is young and full of charm.

853
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,940
No, you flatter me.

854
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,540
Mr. Zhou, you're famous
for your gracious demeanor.

855
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,140
I'm nowhere near your league.

856
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,660
Miss Bai,

857
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,140
you graduated
from Chengmei Academy in Tianjin,

858
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,540
that old American compound
near Zizhulin, right?

859
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,340
Yes.

860
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,140
The teaching buildings
in the southern compound

861
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,780
were already in use
when I was in school.

862
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,020
Is that so?

863
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,580
Tongxin,

864
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,380
Miss Bai went to school
in Tianjin for years,

865
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,500
but she doesn't have an accent at all.

866
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,460
Speaking with a Tianjin accent here
wouldn't be a good idea, would it?

867
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,300
True.

868
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,420
I've always been careful
about that myself.

869
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,220
Well, I heard

870
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,580
there's a big honey locust tree
in your school,

871
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,660
isn't that so?

872
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,500
Mr. Zhou,
you seem to be quite interested

873
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,620
in my school.

874
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,220
Tongxin, how about this?

875
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,540
Let's take Mr. Zhou

876
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,820
on a trip to Tianjin sometime.

877
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,260
And you can see
my alma mater while we're at it.

878
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,300
Sounds great.

879
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,420
Wonderful.

880
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,420
Then it's settled.

881
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,140
Perfect.

882
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,220
- Cheers.
- Alright.

883
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
Well, Mr. Zhou,

884
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,820
since your wife isn't here today,

885
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,580
why don't you tell us a bit more

886
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,740
about that lady friend
you knew back in Peking?

887
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,060
Who do you mean?

888
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
The one who looks a lot like me.

889
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,460
Do we really look that much alike?

890
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,180
Quite a bit, actually.

891
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,340
Then she must've been a real beauty.

892
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Mr. Zhou, you seem to have had
your share of luck with women.

893
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,780
Mr. Zhou,
are you still in touch with her?

894
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,940
Who are you looking for?

895
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,220
Excuse me, which one of you is Mr. Zhou?

896
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,180
That would be me.

897
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,540
Someone asked me to pass this to you.

898
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,300
Alright.

899
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,940
Thank you.

900
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,820
I have something urgent to take care of.

901
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,540
I'll be right back.

902
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,100
- Okay.
- Alright.

903
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,820
Please excuse me.

904
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,420
Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

905
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,060
Alright.

906
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,380
Tongxin, honestly.

907
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,900
If I'd known Mr. Zhou was coming,

908
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,220
I would've prepared something
in advance.

909
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,700
It was all last-minute, Bingxin.

910
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,140
Mr. Zhou insisted on coming.

911
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,540
Come on.

912
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,140
Go.

913
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,020
Get out.

914
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,940
Get out! Go!

915
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,100
I was just going to touch up my makeup

916
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
when I saw the piano.

917
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,140
I couldn't resist the urge to play.

918
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,420
Please forgive my impromptu performance.

919
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,580
Not at all.

920
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,180
You played beautifully.

921
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,300
I was completely entranced.

922
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,220
Thanks.

923
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,700
Let's go back.

924
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,380
Tongxin is waiting for us.

925
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,780
OK. Please.

926
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,140
Get out!

927
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,060
- Let's go.
- Your turban.

928
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,500
Alright, let's go.

929
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,100
Bingxin,

930
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,980
I had no idea you could play the piano.

931
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,020
There's a lot you don't know about me.

932
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,820
That was amazing.

933
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,100
Mr. Zhou,

934
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,020
why aren't you eating?

935
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,940
You seem a little preoccupied

936
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,820
since you

937
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,140
came back.

938
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,340
What's wrong with you?

939
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,300
Nothing.

940
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,340
I just ran into an old friend,
someone I haven't seen in years,

941
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,540
but was once very close to.

942
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,980
And yet, when we met,

943
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,740
there wasn't much to say.

944
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,860
It brought about

945
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,020
a kind of quiet regret.

946
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,060
C'est la vie.

947
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,900
A lot of things in life

948
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,260
are beyond our control.

949
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,900
All we can really do

950
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,260
is let go of what we cling to,

951
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
and make the most of the present.

952
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,620
Miss Bai, your words truly hit home.

953
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,340
Mr. Zhou, their lotus leaf chicken

954
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,460
is absolutely amazing.

955
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,100
Really?

956
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
You've got to try it.

957
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,020
Seems like there's nothing to dip it in.

958
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,940
Right.

959
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,100
Bingxin, why don't you go ask them?

960
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,380
Sure, I'll go check.

961
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,300
So?

962
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,460
Can you tell yet?

963
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,380
At first glance,

964
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,580
they really do look alike.

965
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,300
But when I look closely,

966
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,540
Miss Bai

967
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,140
is graceful, intelligent,

968
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
and talented too.

969
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,180
She's nothing

970
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,300
like the illiterate woman

971
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,500
I met in Peking.

972
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,780
So they're not the same after all.

973
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,580
Why?

974
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,820
Miss Bai comes from a decent family.

975
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,420
You should be happy about that.

976
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,060
Of course I am.

977
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,620
Today's been wonderful.

978
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,340
Goodbye!

979
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,460
Bye.

980
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,580
Going all in tonight, huh?

981
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,500
Easy.

982
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,660
Careful.

983
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm okay.

984
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,660
Really.

985
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:10,900
I'm fine.

986
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,700
Watch your head.

987
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,500
Careful.

988
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,300
Why aren't you getting in?

989
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,300
I'll head back by myself.

990
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,500
No, I want you to come home with me.

991
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,700
Go home with you?

992
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,820
If your brother asks,

993
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,460
what will you tell him about me?

994
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,180
That you're my fiancée.

995
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,940
I don't buy it. You must be lying.

996
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,060
I swear I'm not.

997
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,700
I, Tian Tongxin, am going to marry you.

998
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,380
You can take my word for it.

999
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,380
I always keep my promises.

1000
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,620
Alright, stop.

1001
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,740
You'll just deny it
once you sober up tomorrow.

1002
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,900
No way. I won't deny it.

1003
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean it.

1004
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,740
But you've got nothing to prove it.

1005
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,580
Nothing to prove? Well...

1006
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,780
Take this.

1007
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,580
My mother gave me this.

1008
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,860
I'm giving it to you.

1009
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,060
Alright.

1010
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,530
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

1011
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,540
Then get in the car.

1012
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,420
I really need to take care of something.

1013
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,980
Go home and get some rest.

1014
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,420
I'll come by and see you
first thing tomorrow.

1015
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,500
No.

1016
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,100
Sir, you can go now.

1017
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,260
No.

1018
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,140
No.

1019
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,580
Alright, see you tomorrow.

1020
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,780
Come with me.

1021
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,420
