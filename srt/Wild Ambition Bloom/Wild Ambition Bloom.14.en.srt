00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,620
Got any work experience?

189
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,780
Yes.

190
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,660
She worked at a cotton mill in Qingdao,

191
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,580
same section.

192
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,820
Then head straight there.

193
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,140
Alright, thank you.

194
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,700
Next.

195
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,100
Thanks.

196
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,220
Thanks.

197
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,500
That's it?

198
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,380
Over there.

199
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:45,900
Cuiying,

200
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,300
I'm not 18.

201
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,660
I know.

202
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,580
But older and younger ones

203
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,380
get sent to the raw silk workshop
to reel cocoons

204
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,860
and stand all day long.

205
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
It's the hardest job.

206
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,260
But I've never worked
at the cotton mill in Qingdao.

207
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,780
I know.

208
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,180
But skilled workers can start right away

209
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,140
and earn a bit more too.

210
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,580
But I don't know
how to do drawing frame work.

211
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,220
It's okay. I'll teach you.

212
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,140
Thank you, Cuiying.

213
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:11,900
Let's go.

214
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,620
Come on.

215
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,940
Hurry up!

216
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,340
Stop dawdling.

217
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,540
Keep up.

218
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,580
That clock runs our lives.

219
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Once the hand reaches here,
we start work.

220
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Only when it makes a full circle
can we stop.

221
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,260
Take a tag if you need
to use the restroom.

222
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,580
If you're gone too long,
you'll get beaten.

223
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,540
The three of us
will be working on this machine.

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,300
It's not hard.

225
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,180
You just need to be careful
and quick with your hands.

226
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,300
Like this,

227
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,420
combine several slivers of cotton.

228
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,820
The merged sliver
should be even in weight.

229
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,260
OK.

230
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,580
And the fibers should be neatly aligned.

231
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,580
Oh, right.

232
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,700
It's better to go slow
than make mistakes.

233
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,730
If you're slow, you might get hit.

234
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,250
But if you mess up,

235
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,250
you'll get hit,

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,490
and they'll dock your pay.

237
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,100
Do people here get hit and fined a lot?

238
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,490
You'll get used to it.

239
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,250
You three.

240
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,850
What are you chatting about?

241
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,770
Want me to come down
and join the conversation?

242
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,890
Let's get back to work.

243
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,060
Call me if you need help.

244
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,940
Hurry up!

245
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,370
Keep your hands moving.

246
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,250
No dawdling!

247
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,820
Spent ten minutes in the restroom?

248
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,730
Trying to slack off, huh?

250
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,060
Please, have mercy.

251
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,730
I'm on my period.

252
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,890
My stomach hurts so bad.

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,130
I never slack off, I swear.

254
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,100
Get lost!

255
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,100
What are you staring at?

256
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,300
Get back to work, now!

257
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,770
What I told you this morning

258
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,300
applies to everyone.

259
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,980
No one's getting special treatment.

260
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,940
Hurry up and eat.

261
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,010
So this is the meal

262
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,300
the factory provides?

263
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,100
You'll get used to it.

264
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,530
Nothing.

265
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,060
Food's pretty good today.

266
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,610
Getting all shy now, are we?

267
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,650
Don't look at them.

268
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,610
Don't.

269
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,530
You don't know Gui?

270
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,580
She's new?

271
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,890
Never seen her.

272
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,530
Not bad.

273
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,580
Yeah.

274
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,010
Such a tiny waist.

275
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,890
Pretty,

276
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,940
I'm Agui.

277
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,220
I look after all the new arrivals.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,130
I'll treat you
to something better next time.

279
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,220
With skin like yours,

280
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,770
this factory grub's just unfair.

281
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,980
His old fling.

282
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,250
Are we just letting that slide?

283
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,100
They're with the Qing Gang.

284
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,610
We can't afford to mess with them.

285
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,340
Gui,

286
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,250
your old fling.

287
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,980
Go ahead.

288
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,890
Zhu, you haven't finished your meal.

289
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,100
Doesn't feel as tiring as yesterday.

290
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,220
You little brat, stop right there!

291
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,850
You dare mess with my clock?

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,700
I swear I'll make you pay today!

293
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,250
Stop right there!

294
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,530
Stop!

295
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,090
Don't run.

296
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,810
Did you see a little brat run by?

297
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,730
Yeah.

298
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,090
He slammed into me. My back still hurts.

299
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,940
Then he ran off.

300
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,620
Which way did he go?

301
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,330
That way.

302
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,090
Let's go.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,570
Come on.

304
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,220

Zhu.

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,490
Come on.

310
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,730
You're late.

311
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,660
Only the top bunk's left.

312
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,730
You'll sleep here.

313
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,730
I'm right across from you.

314
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,660
Cuiying, how long have you been here?

315
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,380
Two years.

316
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,530
You've lived like this the whole time?

317
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,090
Better than sleeping
on the street, isn't it?

318
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,220
The door's broken.

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,380
So were the windows.

320
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,010
How come no one fixed them?

321
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,620
You'll get used to it.

322
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,420
Why would I?

323
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,900
We can do something about this.

324
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,380
Do what?

325
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,570
When we just got here,

326
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,290
they told us

327
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,570
we'd work twelve hours a day.

328
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,900
But now we're working

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,860
way more than that.

330
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,570
And they beat us, yell at us,
and dock our pay.

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,730
Even the male workers grope us.

332
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,810
Don't you think
something's wrong with this life?

333
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,530
That's just how life is.

334
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,700
Everyone's going through the same thing.

335
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,050
What's there to complain about?

336
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,220
We're human, aren't we?

337
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,660
Not animals.

338
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,900
Even animals

339
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,940
get fed by their owners.

340
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,460
Look at what we're eating.

341
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,420
Even animals

342
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,810

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,730

344
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,530
Now look at where we sleep.

345
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,660
Factories in Shanghai are all like this.

346
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,620
But just because they're all like this

347
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,660
doesn't mean we have to accept it.

348
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,860
But what other choice

349
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,770
do we have?

350
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,700
Of course we have one.

351
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,010
We can stand together

352
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,530
and negotiate
better conditions with the factory.

353
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,090
What does that mean?

354
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,250
It means

355
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,010
we stick together,

356
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,420

go and demand better treatment.

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,860
Take your hands off!

377
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,940
Stop crying!

378
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,020
Cut it out!

379
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,860
Ladies, miss me?

380
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,580
Cuiying.

381
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,620
Stay back!

382
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,860
Missed me?

383
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,620
Don't come over!

384
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,260
What are you doing?

385
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,260
What do you think you're doing?

386
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,060
Lian.

387
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,700
Don't come over!

388
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,460
Lian, here I come.

389
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:25,940
Lian.

390
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,740
Don't come any closer!

391
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,460
Lian.

392
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,980
Come on, just a little touch.

393
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,740
Get away from me!

394
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,300
Let go!

395
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,260
Come on.

396
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,140
I said get away!

397
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,980
Be good, Lian.

398
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,700
Let her go!

399
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,580
Who's shouting?

400
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,940
Slim Waist.

401
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,860
You were in the canteen earlier,
weren't you?

402
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,580
Stay away from me!

403
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,020
Missed me?

404
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,100
You animal!

405
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,700
Missed me, didn't you?

406
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,260
Help!

407
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,380
Let go of me!

408
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,820
Help!

409
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,500
Come on.

410
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
Let her go!

411
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,060
Gui.

412
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,580
How dare you hit him.

413
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,700
You wretch!

414
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,620
Screw you!

415
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,940
We showed you mercy. You spat on it.

416
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,580
Hit him, I dare you!

417
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,060
- You asked for it!
- Take this!

418
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,700
Hit her!

419
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,900
- I'll beat you up!
- You brought this on yourself!

420
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,580
You had it coming.

421
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,420
Hit her hard!

422
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,060
Wretch!

423
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,260
You lowly woman!

424
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,060
Stop it!

425
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,820
Please, stop!

426
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm begging you!

427
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,140
You earned this!

428
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,540
Please, stop! I beg of you!

429
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,100
I'm begging you. That's enough!

430
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,180
You'll kill her!

431
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,260
You nasty woman!

432
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,500
- Stop!
- Wench!

433
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,860
I'll fight you to the end!

434
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,540
You little punk!

435
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,660
We'll fight you to the bitter end!

436
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Let's take them on!

437
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,100
Hit him!

438
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,260
Smash him!

439
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,460
- You asked for it!
- Take this!

440
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,060
What's going on?

441
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,140
What are you doing?

442
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,580
What the heck are you doing?

443
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,100
Stop it, everyone!

444
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,860
Move!

445
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,620
Out of the way!

446
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,380
This is outrageous.

447
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,140
Starting fights in the factory,

448
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,060
how dare you!

449
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,460
I'll fire every last one of you!

450
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,820
They barged in and started harassing us!

451
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,540
You...

452
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,060
You little vixen!
She was flirting with me earlier!

453
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,940
I don't care!

454
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,100
Look

455
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,500
what you've done to them!

456
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,460
This is all your fault!

457
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,820
Workshop 12, you're all

458
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,500
losing half your pay this month!

459
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,140
They started it!

460
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,540
- They kicked it off!
- They caused this!

461
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,380
I decide who gets docked

462
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,780
and by how much.

463
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,300
Anyone who dares to say another word

464
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,860
will be fired on the spot!

465
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,540
Go to sleep!

466
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,620
Work starts on time tomorrow!

467
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,380
Leave!

468
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,380
Wench.

469
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,740
Just you wait!

470
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,060
You'll pay for this!

471
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,220
Let's go.

472
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,900
How could he?

473
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
How can he do this to us?

474
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,620
This is outrageous!

475
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,260
Zhong and Lu Agui
are clearly in it together!

476
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,220
Ladies.

477
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,860
You saw what happened.

478
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,700
We gave Lu Agui a real beating.

479
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,100
What does that tell you?

480
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,100
It means if we stand united,

481
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,420
no one can push us around!

482
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,380
Not Lu Agui,

483
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,980
and certainly not Zhong!

484
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,380
Exactly.

485
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,420
But we can't just beat Zhong up

486
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,860
to stop him from docking our pay.

487
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,740
No need to fight.

488
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,500
We go on strike.

489
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Strike?

490
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,420
- Strike?
-Strike?

491
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,060
Yes. Starting tomorrow,

492
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,860
none of us is showing up for work.

493
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,580
But if we don't work,

494
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,740
we won't get paid.

495
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,380
And they might beat us for it.

496
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,380
We are on strike

497
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,020
to fight for the right to not be beaten,

498
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,540
for more wages,

499
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,100
better food,

500
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,660
and a safer workshop.

501
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,780
The boss won't agree, will he?

502
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,620
He will fire us.

503
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,380
Then we won't have a job,

504
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,740
and life will be even worse!

505
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,820
Trust me.

506
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,780
He won't dare to fire us.

507
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,020
Why?

508
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,020
They have an urgent order
to finish right now.

509
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,980
If they can't deliver the goods on time,

510
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,140
they will have to pay a penalty.

511
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,580
If they fire us at this time,

512
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,460
they won't be able
to find skilled workers.

513
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,380
The deadline cannot be delayed.

514
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,700
That's right.

515
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,140
Training a skilled worker

516
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,380
will take at least a week.

517
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,180
So at this moment,

518
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,380
they won't fire us.

519
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
As long as we persevere,

520
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,900
they will agree to our terms.

521
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,540
But the premise is,

522
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,420
we must be united

523
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,980
and hold out until the end.

524
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's follow Zhu Sha's lead.

525
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
A while back,

526
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,340
the workers at the First, Second,

527
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,900
and Third Cotton Mills

528
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,700
went on strike for higher wages.

529
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,740
They held out for 13 days,

530
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,580
and in the end, the factories
agreed to their demands.

531
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,780
So we can follow their example.

532
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,220
Now is the perfect time

533
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
to go on strike.

534
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,700
Zhu Sha,

535
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,260
I'm joining the strike.

536
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,100
OK.

537
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,340
I never want to be bullied

538
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,700
by that scoundrel Lu Agui again.

539
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm in too!

540
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,420
Me too!

541
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,460
- Add me to the list.
- Count me in.

542
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,700
- I'm in too!
- I'll join as well!

543
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,540
Very well.

544
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,040
[Shanghai Baoxing Cotton Mill]

545
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,420
These women want to
play games with me, huh?

546
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,380
Let's go!

547
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,220
Where is everyone?

548
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,020
Are you all dead?

549
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,060
What are you all doing?

550
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,220
Get back to work!

551
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,740
Mr. Zhong, starting today,

552
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,180
all 1056 female workers
of Baoxing Cotton Mill

553
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,300
are officially on strike.

554
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,260
I am the representative.

555
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,100
Now I will state our terms
for returning to work.

556
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,380
You're trying
to start a rebellion, aren't you?

557
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,420
First,

558
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,140
retract your punishment from last night.

559
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,020
No wages are to be deducted
from any female worker.

560
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,860
Second,

561
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,180
fire the three troublemakers,

562
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,700
Lu Agui, Jiang Dachang, and Mao Wangcai.

563
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,780
Third,

564
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,620
the working hours each day

565
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,540
must not exceed 12 hours.

566
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,620
You can't just add on extra hours.

567
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,940
Fourth,

568
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,780
no more physical
or verbal abuse of female workers.

569
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,900
Especially you.

570
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,660
Bullshit!

571
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,820
Who are you to be making demands?

572
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,420
Please listen carefully.

573
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,300
I will not repeat myself.

574
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,140
Fifth,

575
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,900
improve the living conditions
for the female workers,

576
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,020
including the safety of the workshops
and the quality of the food,

577
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,180
as well as the right for female workers
to use the restroom and take sick leave.

578
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,620
Absolutely not!

579
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,100
If you want us to get back to work,

580
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,940
all five of these terms must be met.

581
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,860
Not one can be missing.

582
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,540
No work without justice!

583
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,460
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

584
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,380
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

585
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,420
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

586
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,380
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

587
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,260
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

588
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:41,700
Let's go!

589
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,380
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

590
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,460
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

591
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,420
No work...

592
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,940
He's definitely gone to get some help.

593
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,780
Don't be scared.

594
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,460
If they dare to get violent with us,

595
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,260
we'll do as we planned yesterday.

596
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,500
Is everyone ready?

597
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,100
- Yes!
- Yes!

598
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,090
Ladies, get ready to fight!

599
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,290
What...?

600
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,330
I'm warning you!

601
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,940
Hurry up and get back to work!

602
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,700
Otherwise, I'll beat you to death!

603
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,010
Don't make this harder on yourself.

604
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,940
I'm saying this one last time!

605
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,380
Get back to the workshops right now!

606
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,140
Zhong,

607
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,250
you have about 20 people
on your side right now,

608
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,330
but we have over 1,000.

609
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,770
If you don't make the first move,

610
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,180
we will not.

611
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,090
But if you dare to,

612
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,810
you know the consequences best!

613
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,290
You wench!

614
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,900
Don't you dare.

615
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,530
If you mess with me,

616
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,730
you'll regret it.

617
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,140
No work without justice!

618
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,290
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

619
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,530
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

620
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,530
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

621
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,700
What are you doing?
Don't do anything crazy!

622
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,290
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

623
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,250
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

624
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,220
Don't do anything stupid!

625
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,220
- Without justice!
- Without justice!

626
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,980
- No work...
- No work...

627
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,090
Don't run away!

628
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,220
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

629
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,290
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

630
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,810
Do you have any idea
how many silver dollars I'll lose

631
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,380
if the delivery is delayed by a day?

632
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,570
Sir.

633
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,980
Please calm down.

634
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,700
This is Zhong's responsibility.

635
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,620
Cut it out.

636
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,490
If they're not back
to work in two hours,

637
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,900
you're out of a job.

638
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,420
Yes, sir.

639
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,250
Understood.

640
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,140
Just wait. It's okay.

641
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,010
Come on.

642
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,620
Zhong is back again!

643
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,980
Come on.

644
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,900
Ladies, you must be hungry, right?

645
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,380
It's time to eat.

646
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,380
Today's food in the canteen
smells delicious.

647
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,860
There's shredded pork, pork slices,

648
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,700
and pork soup with white rice.

649
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,530
As long as you agree
to get back to work,

650
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,050
the meat, veggies, and rice

651
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,220
are all-you-can-eat.

652
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,620
Ladies,

653
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,460
don't be bought
by this one meal of meat.

654
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,250
Just hold out for two more days.

655
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,660
Come on.

656
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,180
And we can have meat
with every meal from now on.

657
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,010
It smells so good, doesn't it?

658
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,860
Can you smell it? Come on.

659
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,730
Come on.

660
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,570
Take a whiff of this.

661
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,530
Young lady,

662
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,900
it smells so good, right?

663
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,700
Take a look.

664
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,810
Look at this meat.

665
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,010
How thick these slices are!

666
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,900
It's a mouthful of pure richness.

667
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,730
Have a taste.

668
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,380
Come on. Have a taste.

669
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,330
You...

670
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,220
No work without justice!

671
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,250
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

672
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,140
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

673
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,900
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

674
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,700
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

675
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,530
- No work without justice!
- No work without justice!

676
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,290
You…

677
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,140
You dared to try
and take away my job!

678
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,980
Let me tell you something.

679
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,380
If you don't agree to our demands,

680
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,290
we won't just take away your job.

681
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,810
We'll make sure
you're out of a job for good.

682
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,940
Excuse me,

683
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,730
my dear ladies,

684
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,140
sorry I'm late.

685
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,900
I apologize for what you've endured.

686
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,380
I just found out

687
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,490
that Lu Agui

688
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,570
is such a bad person.

689
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,290
But don't worry,

690
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,860
we will punish him severely.

691
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,730
How about

692
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,420
you all go back to work first,

693
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,460
and we can

694
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,420
talk things through?

695
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,730
Mr. Huang,

696
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,380
we have no problem going back to work.

697
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,460
We can do it anytime.

698
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,330
But the factory
must first agree to our demands.

699
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,860
That's

700
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,900
no problem.

701
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,250
Miss Zhu, right?

702
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,250
Okay, Miss Zhu,

703
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,220
please come to my office.

704
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,420
We'll talk there.

705
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,180
No, thank you.

706
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,700
We can talk right here,

707
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,380
in front of all of them.

708
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,090
- That's right!
- That's right!

709
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,660
- Say it here!
- Say it here!

710
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,620
Alright.

711
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,460
Here's the thing.

712
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,620
The demands you've made

713
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,980
need the boss's approval.

714
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,290
But,

715
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,250
he isn't at the factory right now.

716
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,770
So, how about this?

717
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,940
Go back to work first.

718
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,140
In a couple of days,

719
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,420
I'll go negotiate with the boss.

720
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,810
You can all rest assured, okay?

721
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,140
We don't trust you!

722
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,770
Well...

723
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,570
You have my word.

724
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,420
Mr. Huang,

725
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,460
I'll give you my word too.

726
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,810
We won't go back to work

727
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,860
until you agree to our conditions!

728
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,490
- No deal, no work.
- No deal, no work.

729
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,860
- No deal, no work.
- No deal, no work.

730
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,290
- No deal, no work.
- No deal, no work.

731
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,700
Push them back.

732
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,770
Agree to their terms.

733
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,210
We have meat today.

734
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,050
Yeah, I'm so happy.

735
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,490
Zhu Sha,

736
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,820
we wouldn't be eating meat
if it weren't for you.

737
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,380
This first piece is for you.

738
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,980
No, thank you.

739
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,690
She's right.

740
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,260
You should eat more.

741
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,170
Yes, you're the hero.

742
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,010
Eat more.

743
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,570
No, that's enough.

744
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,050
Yes, we have to thank you.

745
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,530
Everyone, please dig in.

746
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,900
Come on.

747
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:02,820
Come on.

748
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,380
It's delicious.

749
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,820
So tasty.

750
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,690
Have some too.

751
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,900
Zhu Sha!

752
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,690
Mr. Huang wants you in his office.

753
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,380
It's okay.

754
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,530
Take care.

755
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,690
The factory has just made a decision.

756
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,860
Effective immediately,

757
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,340
you are no longer employed.

758
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,530
Go to the finance department
to settle your wages,

759
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,980
and then you can leave.

760
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,980
I didn't expect you to be
in such a rush.

761
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,900
What are you talking about?

762
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,860
It's your own fault
for failing the evaluation.

763
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,490
See for yourself.

764
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,980
Don't think that firing me

765
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,260
will solve all your problems.

766
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,010
After this strike,

767
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,740
the female workers already know

768
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,940
how to protect themselves.

769
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,260
And your old methods won't work anymore.

770
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,530
Miss Zhu.

771
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,010
Before you leave,
let me give you a piece of advice.

772
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,610
Trouble comes from talking too much,

773
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,300
and misfortune comes
from sticking your neck out.

774
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,010
Then let me give you one in return.

775
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,050
If you want your business to flourish,

776
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,490
then be a little kinder

777
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,260
to the female workers.

778
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,740
There's no way
you failed the evaluation.

779
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,050
Besides Cuiying,

780
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,740
your work is the best
in the entire drawing frame workshop.

781
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,780
When you want to condemn someone,

782
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,740
you can always trump up a charge.

783
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,090
We've all decided.

784
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,210
We'll strike tomorrow.

785
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,420
We'll get you to stay.

786
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,380
- That's right.
- Exactly.

787
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,490
We'll strike again.

788
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,980
No, please don't.

789
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,940
Why?

790
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,420
The reason the factory was so quick

791
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,570
to agree to our demands before

792
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,940
is that they had a rush order

793
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,780
from Britain.

794
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,420
They couldn't afford
a delay in the schedule.

795
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,650
Now the order is complete,

796
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,170
and they don't have
any deadline pressure.

797
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,740
If you choose to strike now,

798
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,900
they'll just fire you all

799
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,380
and bring in new workers.

800
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,010
Then...

801
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,090
So you're just leaving like this?

802
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,460
What else can I do?

803
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,090
I'm not the boss.

804
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,980
Zhu Sha,

805
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,900
I don't want you to go.

806
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,380
Don't make it so sad.

807
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,170
We all live in Shanghai.

808
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,490
We'll

809
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,380
meet again sooner or later.

810
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm leaving.

811
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,210
Zhu Sha.

812
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,210
Cuiying.

813
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,570
You must never get used to this.

814
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,050
You must make changes.

815
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,050
As long as we stand together,

816
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,490
there's nothing to be afraid of.

817
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,610
So, have you figured out
where you're going?

818
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,860
I don't know either.

819
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,490
But I believe

820
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,210
I will find a place for myself.

821
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,650
I also believe

822
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,690
I have a brighter future ahead.

823
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,300
Ladies,

824
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,820
I'll see you again!

825
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,300
Thank you.

826
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,490
Zhu Sha.

827
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,260
What are you doing here?

828
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,490
You quit, and so did I.

829
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,460
Why?

830
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,050
The boss is too heartless.

831
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,650
Which factory isn't like that?

832
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,860
But I don't really buy it.

833
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,740
I...

834
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,050
I was afraid that Lu Agui and his guys
would give you a hard time again,

835
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,210
so I came here to wait for you.

836
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,170
But even if they did come to me,

837
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,530
what could a kid like you do?

838
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm not a kid.

839
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,570
I'm nine years old.

840
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,050
I couldn't even tell.

841
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,420
I'm just short.

842
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,820
Don't look down on me.

843
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,090
I didn't.

844
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,010
Let me ask you,

845
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,740
do you have anywhere to go now?

846
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,170
Not really.

847
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,740
Then come with me.

848
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,940
Where to?

849
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,980
You'll know when we get there.

850
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,780
Come with me.

851
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,340
Zu got a job at a cigarette factory
a couple of days ago.

852
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,380
It includes food and lodging.

853
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,900
So the room is now empty.

854
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,460
Zu's place is like a mansion
around here.

855
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,260
That's why I said you're lucky.

856
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,300
Otherwise, you'd have to live there.

857
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,820
It's not like
I haven't lived there before.

858
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,940
Be careful.

859
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,940
What are you laughing at?

860
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,570
We're almost there.

861
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,740
Wen.

862
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,690
What's wrong?

863
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,650
Get up.

864
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,010
Sleep in the back.

865
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,940
You'll have to make do for now.

866
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,860
I'll find you a proper bed later.

867
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,130
Thanks.

868
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,260
That's all right.

869
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,490
We've survived the worst together.

870
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,460
I'm heading out.

871
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,650
I'll swing by tomorrow.

872
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,820
Take care.

873
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,570
I'll go find a straw mat.

874
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,940
It's so late.
Where are you going to find one?

875
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,010
Where did you get all this stuff?

876
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,570
Asked some friends to help.

877
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,010
You have a lot of friends around here?

878
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,570
I grew up here.

879
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,300
Cheng Hui, where are your parents?

880
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,090
They died a long time ago.

881
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,170
You take the bed tonight.

882
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,940
I'll sleep here.

883
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,420
No, you take the bed.

884
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,380
I'm fine on the floor.

885
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,130
It's okay. Just go with what I say.

886
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,380
I'm used to it.

887
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:39,900
Here.

888
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,650
I'm good.

889
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:48,570
What are you doing?

890
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,490
Seeing if I've got enough

891
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,300
to get us through a few days.

892
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,010
Let's be clear.

893
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,380
I don't want you supporting me.
