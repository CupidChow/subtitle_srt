00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,370
Mr. Wen, stop wasting your time

190
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,370
on me.

191
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,180
You think so?

192
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,180
I'm just not interested in you.

193
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,420
Well, I'm very interested in you.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,770
Sorry,

195
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,770
but I need to take care of something.

196
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,980
You really won't even hear
what I want to talk to you about?

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,010
Hi sir, anything I can help you with?

198
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,650
Sir, how can I help you?

199
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,890
I'd be happy to show you around.

200
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,580
Sure.

201
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,010
Take a look. Maybe one of them
will catch your eye.

202
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,300
This one.

203
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,100
Great choice, sir.

204
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,850
This one's called
the John Howard Gold Pen.

205
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,940
Feel free to give it a try.

206
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,010
One fill

207
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
lasts through about 50 pages.

208
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,850
It writes incredibly smoothly, too.

209
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,850
Go ahead and try it out.

210
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,130
Take your time.

211
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,420
Let me know if you need anything.

212
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,340
Anything you'd like to see, sir?

213
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,660
We've just stocked
a lot of new arrivals.

214
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,260
What brings you here?

215
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,820
Just dropping off some flowers.

216
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,420
And while I'm here,

217
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,860
thought I'd pick up a pen.

218
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,860
Any particular brand?

219
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,740
The most expensive one.

220
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,100
How many would you like?

221
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,220
Let's start with 200.

222
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,820
Mr. Tian, check out over here please.

223
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,820
Two hundred pens?

224
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,140
Our department

225
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,940
only sold 192 last month.

226
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,020
Mr. Tian really doesn't hold back.

227
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,460
Excuse me, miss.

228
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,540
So? Do you like it?

229
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,980
If this one's not quite
what you're looking for,

230
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,660
I've got another option

231
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,620
that's just as good.

232
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,420
It's from Eagle.

233
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,620
Give it a try.

234
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,460
Miss,

235
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,020
I'm the manager
of Shanghai Film Company.

236
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,060
We're recruiting actresses.

237
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,220
Are you interested in acting in films?

238
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,540
It's okay.

239
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,260
This is

240
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,660
my contact information and address.

241
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,580
Let me know if you'd like to talk more.

242
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,180
Please take a look.

243
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,020
Mr. Liu.

244
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,820
Thank you for your appreciation.

245
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,900
But maybe we can talk about that later.

246
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,340
Would you consider this pen, though?

247
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,940
I'm not interested in that.

248
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,060
But I hope

249
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,420
you'll give it some serious thought.

250
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,420
Sorry,

251
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,300
I've got a lot going on.

252
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
No worries. I'll drop by after work.

253
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,780
That won't be necessary.

254
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,740
Sir, is there anything
you're looking for?

255
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,700
No, just browsing.

256
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,340
We've got lots of new arrivals.

257
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,140
Miss Zhu.

258
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,780
Miss Zhu.

259
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,020
Who are you?

260
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
Our company is producing a film

261
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,100
that celebrates professional women.

262
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,420
I think you'd be perfect
for the lead role.

263
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,620
So I'm here to invite you
to give it a try.

264
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
They want you to star in the movie?

265
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,940
Sorry,

266
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,620
I'm not interested in acting.

267
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,100
Miss Zhu, the lead character in our film

268
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,180
is also an office worker.

269
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,700
What kind of role is it?

270
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,460
Right now, I just want to
focus on selling fountain pens.

271
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,020
Thank you, though.

272
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,460
Miss Zhu.

273
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,700
You could check out our script

274
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,900
or maybe visit the set sometime.

275
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,820
Honestly, you'd be perfect
for the role of a working woman.

276
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,340
Really.

277
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,740
Yes.

278
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,820
Please find someone else, okay?

279
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,220
Miss Zhu, those are the stars
we've signed.

280
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,700
Take a look and think it over.

281
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,580
Please.

282
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,780
Fine.

283
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,980
Miss Zhu.

284
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,740
We're a legitimate company.

285
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,300
And they're inviting you
to star in a film.

286
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,980
Stop bothering me, both of you.

287
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,580
There's only one thing on my mind.

288
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,300
I need to sell
200 fountain pens within a month.

289
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,860
I don't want to think about

290
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,980
anything or anyone else.

291
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,940
Why am I even telling you all this?

292
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,420
Miss Zhu,

293
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,700
our company has prepared

294
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,620
several films,

295
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,420
including The Spider Cave,
The Widow Wants to Remarry,

296
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,700
and Back Home from City.

297
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,700
Really?

298
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,340
Of course.

299
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,180
All major productions.

300
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,300
Yeah!

301
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,380
That's impressive.

302
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,540
Need a leading man?

303
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
I'll recommend you next time.

304
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,380
Sounds good.

305
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,260
Next time, you...

306
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,140
Let's head to the set!

307
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,540
- Now! Yes!
- OK, to the set.

308
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
This way.

309
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:48,980
Let's go.

310
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,740
But Miss Zhu,

311
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,620
leading ladies

312
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,500
requires training, too.

313
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,180
That doesn't matter.

314
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,220
They might not be
a proper company at all.

315
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,660
You've been tricked!

316
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,260
With your looks,

317
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,700
there's no way
they'd cast you as the leading lady!

318
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,700
Qiusheng, you're back.

319
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,740
Cut!

320
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,740
Miss Bai.

321
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,780
Let the emotion come through.

322
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,380
You haven't seen each other in years.

323
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,340
It's a long-awaited reunion.

324
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,540
You need to cry.

325
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,660
Again.

326
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Alright, get ready.

327
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,100
Five.

328
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,100
Four.

329
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:25,900
Three.

330
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,660
Two.

331
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,340
One.

332
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,140
Action!

333
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,540
Qiusheng,

334
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,980
you're back!

335
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,540
Cut!

336
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,460
You've been acting
for almost a year now.

337
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,020
How are you still as stiff as a board?

338
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,860
Sir, let's do one more take.

339
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,100
Last one.

340
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,860
If you still can't cry,
we're replacing you.

341
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,220
Alright, all departments, get ready.

342
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,060
Five.

343
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:53,980
Four.

344
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,660
Three.

345
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,340
Two.

346
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,140
One.

347
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,100
Action!

348
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,180
Qiusheng, you're back.

349
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,260
Cut!

350
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,580
Miss Bai

351
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,740
- is finally getting it.
- Shaohua.

352
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,500
I only worked
at that place on Weihai Road

353
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,940
for a few months.

354
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,460
Then I moved on to a cotton mill.

355
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,940
I've shined shoes for people,
mended clothes,

356
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,180
and even worked as a shop assistant.

357
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,620
I only started acting last year.

358
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,020
The pay's pitiful, sure,

359
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,780
but at least the work
is not too exhausting.

360
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,100
And as long as I stay driven,

361
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,420
I can always find other ways
to make money.

362
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,660
I did write to you,

363
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,340
but every letter came back, undelivered.

364
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,580
I went back to Qizhou
the year after you left.

365
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,780
You went back to Qizhou?

366
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,980
Why?

367
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,620
Wasn't your family's business

368
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,020
doing well over there?

369
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,940
Dashun died.

370
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,980
His father passed away too.

371
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,540
And his mother

372
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,780
was killed by bandits.

373
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,580
♪Draped in the long night's bitter snow♪

374
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,380
What about...

What were last week's sales figures?

00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,260
They're out already.

423
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,420
Take a look.

424
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,340
Alright, thanks.

425
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,660
Over 18 days,

426
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,220
you sold 84 units.

427
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,460
The total came to 121 dollars.

428
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,180
That's actually a pretty solid result.

429
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,060
But Ni Xiangying

430
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,260
sold a total of 264 units.

431

I can transfer you
to the Optics Department right away.

People over there
are easier to work with.

434
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,740
They offer way better commission
than we do here.

435
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,540
I appreciate it, Ms. Shen.

436
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,260
But I don't want to give up just yet.

437
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,340
There are only 12 days left.

438
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,140
I'll be working straight through
from tomorrow.

439
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,380
Also,

440
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,180
can I take some samples
out of the office?

441
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,380
That way, I can go to places like cafés

442
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,300
or Western-style restaurants

443
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220
and try to pitch the products.

444
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,180
And one more thing,
can I print extra business cards?

445
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,580

450
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,980
Try it on, and see if it fits.

451
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,260
And these shoes.

452
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,620
I've worn them before,

453
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,060
but they're made of lambskin,

459
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,580

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,460
See?

462
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,820
I want to study
these fountain pen materials

463
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,020
and redesign a few sales ads.

464
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,100

468

I'll show you something new tonight.

473

478
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,460
I must surpass Ni Xiangying before then.

481
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,580
are going to that ball tonight.

483
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,900

484
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,380

485

486

and Rong families.

487
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,820
Even the Tian family's eldest
and second sons will be there.

488
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,740
I heard Lu Xiaojia's going too.

489
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,940
You know all these people?

490
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,420
Me? Not at all.

491
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,900
But once I'm there,
I'll get to know them.

This looks nice.

493
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,940

Finally, you're getting it.

495
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,100
Should I also bring

496

some product samples?

497
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,180

to bring someone along.

But tonight's ball...

546
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,460

547

If I let you in,

553
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,060
I'll lose my job.

554
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,540
You're so rigid.

555
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,220
You really want me

556
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,300
to get your manager
to fire you right now?

557
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,660
Why don't you go in first?

558
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,660
What about you?

559
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,780
I'll figure something out.

560
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,260
How about this?

561
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,220
Wait here.

562
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,700
I'll go in first.

563
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,220
Maybe I can find a way once I'm inside.

564
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,220
Alright.

565
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,340
Invitation, please.

566
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,260
Miss Zhu.

567
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,300
You're here for the ball too?

568
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:18,980
Yeah.

569
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,540
I heard it's a pretty grand event.

570
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,820
You can't get in without an invitation.

571
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,460
That's right.

572
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,460
Aren't you going in?

573
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,980
I'm waiting for a friend.

574
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,220
Alright then.

575
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,260
See you later.

576
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:32,940
Wait,

577
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,460
Mr. Wen,

578
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,620
your invitation's all good, right?

579
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,500
I suppose it is.

580
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,620
Well, here's the thing.

581
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,180
Someone tried to get in earlier
with a fake invitation.

582
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,540
They got caught

583
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,220
and thrown out.
It was pretty embarrassing.

584
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,100
Seriously?

585
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,060
I heard the real invitations

586
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,540
have a secret mark on them.

587
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,660
The fake ones don't.

588
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,380
Let me take a look.

589
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,860
Where's the hidden seal
on my invitation?

590
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,300
It should be on here. Let me check.

591
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,500
Hmm, yours really doesn't have it.

592
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,620
No worries, I'll go ask for you.

593
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,700
I'll check with them,

594
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,420
don't worry.

595
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,340
Thanks.

596
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,740
Thanks.

597
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,700
Duofold.

598
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,100
This is Parker's latest release.

599
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,540
A truly groundbreaking design.

600
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,180
I just bought it.

601
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,340
Sir, you have excellent taste.

602
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,020
But may I suggest

603
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,340
pairing it with a Sheaffer Lifetime?

604
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,540
It would complement
your strong, bold presence perfectly.

605
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,780
Really? Thank you.

606
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,220
Absolutely.

607
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Then what kind of pen
do you think suits me?

608
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,420
Honestly, sir, you're young and stylish.

609
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,500
The Ideal would suit you even better.

610
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,860
And me?

611
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,140
No need to even look,

612
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,060
your elegance
is a perfect match for Montblanc.

613
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,180
Excuse me.

614
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,620
Great.

615
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,780
Gentlemen,

616
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,780
I'm Zhu Sha from Evernew Department.

617
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,780
If you ever need to buy fountain pens,

618
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,340
feel free to come to me.

619
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,660
I can offer you a discount.

620
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,180
Well then, enjoy yourselves.

621
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I'll leave you to it.

622
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,980
Alright.

623
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,580
Miss Zhu Sha.

624
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,140
Can you believe that?

625
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,300
Let's grab a drink sometime.

626
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,260
No problem.

627
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,740
I'll drop by sometime.

628
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,380
OK.

629
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,300
Alright, thanks.

630
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,900
Mr. Xia, how's business?

631
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,660
Excuse me.

632
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,420
Who are you?

633
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,060
Who let you in?

634
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,700
Sorry.

635
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,140
I came to the wrong place.

636
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,780
Wait.

637
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,460
No luck changes
without cracking open the way.

638
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,660
You're here to turn my luck around.

639
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,740
I've been losing all night.

640
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,940
Whether I can turn things around
depends on this round.

641
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,540
Tell me.

642
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,300
So, what should I go with, big or small?

643
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,700
He's asking you.

644
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,940
Don't scare the lady.

645
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,900
[Small]

646
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,900
Small.

647
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,540
Final bet. Small.

648
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,620
Fifteen points. Big.

649
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,420
You made me lose money.

650
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm sorry.

651
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,060
So you're not here to change my luck.

652
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,420
You're here to mess things up.

653
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,700
Let her go.

654
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,220
I can win back the two chips

655
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,940
you just lost.

656
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,580
Really?

657
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,820
But you'll need enough money.

658
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,980
Money's not a problem.

659
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,340
I've got plenty.

660
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,780
But what if you don't win it back?

661
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,620
Then do whatever you want with me.

662
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,500
I've never met a woman this bold.

663
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,220
You in?

664
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,220
Let's do it.

665
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,180
Double down. Bet small.

666
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,980
Double down. Bet small.

667
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,900
Final bet. Small.

668
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,060
Thirteen points. Big.

669
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,700
Double again.

670
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,060
Bet small again.

671
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,460
Keep going. Small.

672
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,220
Final bet. Small.

673
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,700
Eleven points. Big.

674
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
Keep doubling.

675
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,900
Keep betting small.

676
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,860
Still small.

677
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,300
Final bet. Small.

678
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,060
Fifteen points. Big.

679
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,300
Still going?

680
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,580
You running out of money?

681
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,180
Double again. Bet small.

682
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Still small.

683
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,860
Final bet. Small.

684
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,300
Twelve points. Big.

685
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,180
Double again. Bet small.

686
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,860
Can you pull it off or not?

687
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,980
Trust me.

688
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,420
I must be crazy.

689
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,740
Small.

690
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,460
Final bet. Small.

691
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,060
Eight points. Small.

692
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,500
Sir,

693
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,300
if I'm not mistaken,

694
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,660
I won back everything

695
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,260
I lost since I got here

696
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
in the last round.

697
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,940
And you must've won quite a bit too.

698
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,620
Miss,

699
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,980
do you know how much

700
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,660
that final round was worth?

701
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,020
No.

702
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,860
Fifty thousand silver dollars!

703
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Thank you

704
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,620
for making me
the biggest winner tonight.

705
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,020
But you're not the real winner.

706
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,860
Then who is?

707
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,140
The house.

708
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,260
Him?

709
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:30,900
Why?

710
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:35,380
Why didn't I realize it earlier?

711
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,380
What?

712
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,020
Sorry,

713
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,860
I've got something to take care of.

714
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,660
I'll leave you to it.

715
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,660
Then pick me up
at the department store entrance.

716
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,180
Sure.

717
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,980
Tongxin,

718
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,780
I'm just going to use the bathroom.

719
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,660
It really is you.

720
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,460
Hello.

721
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,580
Only 300 invitations were sent out

722
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,420
in all of Shanghai.

723
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,700
I'm genuinely curious.

724
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,500
How did you get in?

725
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,860
I got in the same way you did.

726
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,380
If you ask me,

727
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,580
someone like you, a total bumpkin,

728
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,780
has no right to be here.

729
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,700
And anyone who works with a bumpkin

730
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,420
must be one too.

731
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,620
An invitation for Wen Zhiqiu.

732
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,460
So you really did sneak in
under someone else's name.

733
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
This has nothing to do with you.

734
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,500
Manager.

735
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,660
What's going on with your security?

736
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,540
How did someone like this even get in?

737
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,020
Excuse me, what's happening here?

738
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,100
This woman impersonated someone else

739
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
and crashed the ball.

740
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,140
I suspect

741
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,220
she has ulterior motives.

742
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,260
Miss,

743
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,820
sorry, may I see your invitation?

744
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,700
Look over here.

745
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,900
Some lowlife

746
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,660
managed to sneak in.

747
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,340
Watch where you are going.

748
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,140
You...

749
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,860
Sorry.

750
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,740
Sorry, let me handle this.

751
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,460
I got it.

752
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,980
Aren't you Miss Bai Bingxin,
the movie star?

753
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,060
Hello.

754
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,500
Miss Bai, I've admired you for so long.

755
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,660
It's such an honor
to meet you in person.

756
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,060
Miss Bai, I have to say

757
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,660
you look even more stunning
than you do on screen.

758
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,700
Thank you.

759
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,140
So, may I have this dance with you?

760
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,340
I only dance with my boyfriend.

761
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:06,820
Boyfriend?

762
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,340
Sorry to bother you.

763
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,980
Excuse me.

764
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,540
Sorry about that.

765
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,420
I had no choice but
to use you as a decoy.

766
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,580
My pleasure.

767
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,060
It's all my fault

768
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,900
for making your suit dirty.

769
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,900
Let me buy you a new one.

770
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,820
It's really no big deal.

771
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,180
I'm the one who ruined your drink.

772
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,500
If anyone should pay, it should be me.

773
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,180
How about now?

774
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,500
Please.

775
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,820
Miss,

776
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,740
invitation please.

777
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,340
That invitation isn't even hers.

778
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,660
Miss.

779
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,940
If you can't show your invitation,

780
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
I'll have to call security.

781
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
She's my friend.

782
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,340
Mr. Lu.

783
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,780
She's your friend?

784
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,700
Then it must be a misunderstanding.

785
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,580
Sorry, I didn't know.

786
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,060
Miss, I apologize.

787
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,500
I'm sorry.

788
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,820
Everyone, nothing to see here.

789
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,020
Just a misunderstanding.

790
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,700
Enjoy your drinks.

791
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,100
Let's move along.

792
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,740
Sir,

793
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,540
thank you.

794
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,180
You helped me out earlier,
and I returned the favor.

795
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,700
Now we're even.

796
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,420
Yes.

797
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,540
Your invitation.

798
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,660
I got something for you.

799
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,260
For me?

800
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,540
Thanks.

801
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,380
What's this?

802
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,940
Open it. Take a sniff.

803
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,180
Is that enough?

804
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,260
Almost.

805
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,180
The ball isn't over yet.

806
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,580
If you want to go in, it's not too late.

807
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,420
The person I wanted to see is gone.

808
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,900
Sorry.

809
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,700
Do you know how much I paid

810
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,900
just to get this invitation?

811
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,900
Then let me pay you back.

812
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,180
Of course you need to.

813
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,060
How about...

814
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,260
having a bowl of wontons with me?

815
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,700
Get in the car.

816
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,620
My family in Suzhou
is considered quite prestigious.

817
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,100
When I graduated from middle school,

818
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,060
I was supposed to study abroad.

819
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,820
But then our family fell on hard times.

820
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,380
So I started working.

821
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,820
First, I was an apprentice
at an herbal medicine shop.

822
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,580
Later, I started my own herbal business.

823
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,780
No wonder.

824
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,300
I just opened a pharmacy.

825
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,820
It's going to be the most profitable one
in Shanghai.

826
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,060
What about you? Tell me about yourself.

827
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:02,940
What?

828
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,260
Where are you from?

829
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,780
I'm from the countryside.

830
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,740
Where exactly?

831
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,180
Even if I told you, you wouldn't know.

832
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,300
Who do you still have at home?

833
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Most of them are gone now.

834
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,340
What does

835
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,180
your family do?

836
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,060
What kind of work can people do
in the countryside?

837
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,620
What's your Chinese zodiac sign?

838
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,780
Wait, what does that
have to do with you?

839
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,580
Nothing.

840
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,420
I was just wondering

841
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,340
if our signs
are totally wrong for each other.

842
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,900
Mr. Wen,

843
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,580
I came to Shanghai

844
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,380
with only one goal.

845
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,180
To earn money and support myself.

846
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,020
I don't want to
think about anything else.

847
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,660
There are many ways to make a living.

848
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,180
You don't have to rely

849
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,220
on selling pens.

850
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,100
I know what you mean.

851
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,300
But I'm actually quite satisfied
with my life right now.

852
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,100
Really?

853
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,740
That's because you don't know yourself.

854
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,820
Mr. Wen.

855
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,180
Let me put it this way.

856
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
I really appreciate your admiration.

857
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,500
But I think
you shouldn't waste any more time

858
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,340
pursuing me.

859
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,420
With all the time and energy,

860
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,860
you'd be better off finding someone

861
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,460
more compatible with you,
like a socialite.

862
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,260
So you think I'm trying to pursue you?

863
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,220
Well, based on your actions,
I'd say yes.

864
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,620
Flowers for sale!

865
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,180
Would you like some flowers?

866
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,740
Little girl,

867
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,380
come over.

868
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,060
Would you like some flowers?

869
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,660
I want one.

870
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,660
This one will do.

871
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,700
- Thanks.
- I appreciate it.

872
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,780
Flowers!

873
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,020
Flowers!

874
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,100
