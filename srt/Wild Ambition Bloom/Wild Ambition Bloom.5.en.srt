00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,220
Chen Ershun left behind.

189
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,300
Then what should we do?

190
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,160
[Juxian Teahouse]

191
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,650
It's just a brothel.

192
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,100
Let's go.

193
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,450
Chen Ershun promised me a commission.

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,690
Does that still count?

195
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,130
Yes.

196
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,300
Good to hear that.

197
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,820
Please come in.

198
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,460
Mr. Zhou!

199
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,460
You haven't been here for a long time.

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,220
Is that so?

201
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,820
Where's my dear Lu Ningxiang?

202
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,850
She's been expecting you.

203
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,770
Really?

204
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll take you there.

205
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,890
You've slimmed down.

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,250
Ningxiang.

207
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,370
Alright.

208
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,100
Where's Madam Yan?

209
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,650
Madam Yan?

210
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,650
She's with a guest right now.

211
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,850
Then please tell her

212
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,010
that we've finished checking

213
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,980
and her bills are sorted
and left on the table.

214
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,300
Okay, got it.

215
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,530
Then we'll take our leave.

216
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,130
Alright.

217
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,890
I'll teach you a lesson
for that attitude!

218
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,730
You're actually hitting me?

219
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,300
How dare you

220
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,850
speak to a guest like that!

221
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
So arrogant, huh?

222
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,020
Signed your body away,

223
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,490
and still putting on airs?

224
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,060
Think you're still a virgin?

225
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,100
Come here!

226
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,940
Kang Erniu!

227
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,060
Erniu.

228
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,500
Lu Ningxiang.

229
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,490
Erniu.

230
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,420
My name is Lu Ningxiang.

231
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,660
You've got the wrong person.

232
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,820
You are Erniu.

233
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,380
They know each other?

234
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,220
That must hurt so much.

235
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm used to it.

236
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
Have some water.

237
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,860
How did you

238
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300
end up here?

239
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,060
It's my miserable fate, I guess.

240
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,340
Where's Wu?

241
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,100
I don't know.

242
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,220
How much

243
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,260
would it cost to buy your freedom?

244
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
What did you just say?

245
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
I want to take you out of here.

246
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,660
Why would I leave?

247
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,380
This place eats you alive.

248
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,500
Shaohua!

249
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,620
You see it as a place of ruin,

250
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,500
but I think it suits me just fine.

251
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,260
I don't have to toil in the fields.

252
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,780
I eat my fill every day

253
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,620
and dress up nice.

254
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,180
The wind doesn't bite,

255
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,220
the rain doesn't soak,

256
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,700
and the sun doesn't burn.

257
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,420
Look at my face.

258
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,700
Really?

259
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,420
Back home,

260
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,940
my father beat me day after day.

261
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,140
At least at home,
you still had your dignity.

262
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,220
But here, do you have it?

263
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,860
Come in.

264
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,980
Ma'am.

265
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
I was just looking.

266
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,980
You want to know

267
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,660
why I'm here?

268
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,420
Before Wu and I came to Peking,

269
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,980
we took some money from the Xia family.

270
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,540
At first, things were good.

271
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,860
We had food, drinks, everything.

272
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,540
But it didn't last.

273
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,100
I asked him to work,

274
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,540
but he thought it was too tiring.

275
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,820
He thought gambling
was an easier way to make money.

276
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,140
Does anyone ever truly win at gambling?

277
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,980
You know what,

278
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,380
he actually won at first.

279
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,060
But the longer it went on,

280
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,060
the more miserably he lost.

281
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,860
At last, he borrowed from loan sharks.

282
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,060
When those people came
to collect the debt from him,

283
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
he sold me here.

284
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,580
Where is he?

285
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,220
I don't know.

286
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,260
He said

287
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,620
he'd earn enough to buy my freedom.

288
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,780
But after that, he disappeared.

289
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,220
Erniu,

290
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,140
don't worry.

291
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,620
I will get you out of here.

292
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,580
Shaohua,

293
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
with those words,

294
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
our friendship wasn't in vain.

295
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,060
But I won't leave.

296
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
Why?

297
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,100
I've been touched by too many hands.

298
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,060
I'm nothing but filth.

299
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,140
My life's already ruined.

300
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,340
No.

301
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,820
Just leave me alone.

302
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,020
Let me waste away in this place
like I was meant to.

303
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,780
It's fine.

304
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,300
No.

305
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,620
I never thought I'd see you again.

306
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,540
Seeing you today,

307
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,580
so full of life,

308
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,660
I'm truly happy for you.

309
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,220
But after this,

310
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,500
let's not meet again.

311
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,780
No.

312
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,340
You don't get to decide this.

313
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,260
No.

314
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,740
Promise me.

315
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,140
Out you go.

316
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,780
Erniu.

317
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,140
Erniu.

318
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,140
Erniu.

319
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,260
Even if you give up on yourself,

320
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,660
I won't.

321
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,780
I'll come to you.

322
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
Mrs. Chen Junior.

323
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,300
Lu Ningxiang asked me
to give you a message.

324
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,860
Don't come again.

325
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,860
Even if you do,

326
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,140
she won't see you.

327
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,220
Then tell her,

328
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,940
since we shared a childhood,

329
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,380
she should understand what I am like.

330
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,260
Having a nice little break, are we?

331
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,780
Already gone?

332
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,540
Who are you asking about?

333
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,660
Mrs. Chen Junior

334
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,740
or Mr. Zhou?

335
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,860
Mrs. Chen Junior.

336
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,380
She left and won't be coming back.

337
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
Mr. Zhou isn't coming either.

338
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Isn't that great?

339
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,860
Nice to have a little peace for once.

340
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,940
Mr. Chen has invited Miss Lu Ningxiang

341
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,100
to the Shunwang Room
at Chunhua Restaurant.

342
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,660
Alright.

343
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,420
Hurry up and get ready.

344
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,100
Business is here.

345
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,460
Don't give me any more trouble.

346
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,820
You're not hitting me anymore?

347
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,460
Mr. Chen.

348
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
Didn't I tell you

349
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,900
we shouldn't see each other again?

350
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
Why are you back?

351
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,220
Do you remember when we were kids,

352
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,020
washing clothes together by the river?

353
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,980
I tried to help you grab those
that had drifted off,

354
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,860
and I slipped right into the water.

355
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,300
You reacted so fast

356
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,740
and grabbed me.

357
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,780
But we were little

358
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,660
and weak.

359
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
You couldn't get me back to shore.

360
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,820
We were stuck there, holding on.

361
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,700
I told you,

362
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,180
"Let go,

363
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,300
or you'll fall in too."

364
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,220
But you wouldn't.

365
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,260
You just kept holding on

366
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,980
until someone finally came and saved us.

367
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,860
You didn't let go back then,

368
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,580
and I'm not letting go now.

369
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,780
Enough about the past.

370
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,020
You can pull me out of this mess,

371
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,620
but you can't give me back

372
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,940
what I've lost.

373
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:54,980
Erniu.

374
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,380
Do you still remember this?

375
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,380
Back then at Qizhou's Medicine Market,

376
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,660
we only had enough to buy this.

377
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,180
It wasn't worth much,

378
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
just a few wen.

379
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,140
But you were

380
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,780
so happy, wearing it in your hair.

381
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,660
In my heart,

382
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,580
this red hair tie is the best.

383
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,580
Even the most expensive beaded hairpin
can't compare.

384
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,180
You were the most beautiful
at the Medicine Market.

385
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,220
I was quite happy then.

386
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,460
But my red hair tie

387
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,460
is missing.

388
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,500
Just keep it

389
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,740
if you want.

390
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,420
It's okay if you lost yours.

391
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,700
Mine is still here, isn't it?

392
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,700
I'll give you mine.

393
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,660
Back then, when you wore it,

394
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,780
you were the most beautiful girl
at the Medicine Market.

395
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,020
Now,

396
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,660
just wear it again,

397
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,220
and you'll still be that girl,

398
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,980
always, no matter what.

399
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,540
I'm not worthy anymore.

400
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,140
So what if you were unlucky in love?

401
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,220
So what if you lived
as a courtesan for a while?

402
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,620
No matter what you've been through,

403
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,540
you'll always be the most beautiful girl
in my heart.

404
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,220
Who says you can't go back?

405
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,180
As long as you don't give up,

406
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,540
you can always start over.

407
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,460
Do you think

408
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,940
I can still start over?

409
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,260
Absolutely.

410
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,300
Really?

411
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,060
There's nothing you can't do,

412
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,540
as long as you truly want to.

413
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,660
Three thousand silver dollars.

414
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,340
What?

415
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,180
How much?

416
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,740
And the clothes and jewelry on you,

417
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,140
the furnishings in this room,

418
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,340
all need to be left behind.

419
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,460
You're too greedy.

420
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,460
When Wu sold me to you,

421
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,260
it was only for 200, wasn't it?

422
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,660
It's been so many years.

423
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
I've helped you earn

424
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,620
at least 1,000.

425
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,260
You got it back long ago.

426
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,060
Why don't you calculate
how much money I've spent on you?

427
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,540
Every bite you take,
every drink you sip,

428
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,260
what you wear,
what you put on your face,

429
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,780
on your lips, in your hair.

430
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,460
I paid for masters to teach you
music, art, poetry, and songs.

431
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,300
Even how to charm men.

432
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Was there anything
I didn't spend money on?

433
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,300
Why are you shouting at me?

434
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,060
If you want to calculate it that way...

435
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,740
Madam Yan,

436
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,260
so it's 3,000.

437
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,860
Alright.

438
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,980
I need to talk it over with my family.

439
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,740
Xuan is asleep?

440
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,180
What's wrong?

441
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,220
I want to...

442
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,980
borrow some money from you.

443
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,340
"Borrow" is not a word we use, is it?

444
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,980
How much do you want?

445
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,660
Three thousand silver dollars.

446
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,660
What do you need so much money for?

447
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,700
I met Erniu today.

448
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,140
She's at Linfang Pavilion.

449
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,020
I want to buy her freedom.

450
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,940
Wait a minute.

451
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,580
Erniu?

452
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,300
My best friend.

453
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,500
Linfang Pavilion?

454
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,300
She was tricked.

455
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,380
You want to buy her freedom?

456
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,900
That madam

457
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,940
asked for 3,000.

458
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,020
I must rescue her.

459
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,700
Shaohua,

460
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,220
do you have any idea what 3,000 means?

461
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,780
That's a huge amount of money.

462
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,700
I know.

463
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,180
But...

464
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,220
after thinking it over and over,

465
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,620
I could only ask you.

466
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,420
There's no other way.

467
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,620
Shaohua,

468
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,460
I started doing business
with my father when I was 15.

469
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,740
And after all these years,
I've only managed

470
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,820
to save a little over 200.

471
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,260
I gave some to you

472
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,860
and some to Shaozhong.

473
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm down to about 100 at the moment.

474
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,060
But what about Erniu?

475
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,780
You can only come up with 100?

476
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,500
Then what about me?

477
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,820
How about

478
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,220
you bear with it for another year?

479
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,260
Another year?

480
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,500
Yes.

481
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,500
So you're telling me to stay here

482
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,740
and let those filthy men
lay their hands on me for another year?

483
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,700
But it's just one year, really.

484
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,980
Just one year, huh?

485
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,340
Why don't you stay here?

486
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,100
Let's switch places. Not even a year,

487
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
one night.

488
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
Erniu, I...

489
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,060
Chu Shaohua, I've already told you

490
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,300
to let me waste away in this place.

491
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,580
Why did you have to meddle?

492
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,100
I was already in despair.

493
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
Why did you give me hope?

494
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,860
And now you just throw it away, saying,

495
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,980
"The money's not enough"?

496
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,100
Then what am I supposed to do?

497
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,100
You don't have to save me
since I'm dying.

498
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,220
But can you please not make me

499
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,900
suffer over and over again?

500
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,660
Erniu, I promise,

501
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,340
in a year, I will raise the money

502
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,500
to buy your freedom.

503
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,260
I've heard those words all before.

504
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,660
Wu said the same thing.

505
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,900
So did Mr. Wang.

506
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,540
Even Mr. Zhou.

507
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,060
But where are they now?

508
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,700
Chu Shaohua,
I finally see you for who you are.

509
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,620
You're no different
from those filthy men.

510
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,460
Erniu, I'm not like that.

511
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,180
Get out.

512
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,660
Go!

513
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,220
Do you know

514
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,700
how big a sum of money that is?

515
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,260
Doesn't the Chen family
run an apothecary in Peking?

516
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,500
Don't they do big business?

517
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,300
The business belongs to Dashun's father,

518
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,620
not his.

519
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,740
They're all just excuses.

520
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,100
You all have money,

521
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,660
but no one is willing to save me.

522
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,900
I mean it!

523
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,620
No, you don't!

524
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,540
It's all false, Chu Shaohua.

525
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,780
You're full of lies.

526
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,380
You don't even realize it anymore.

527
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,460
All that talk about our bond? Fake.

528
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,380
Saving me? Just another lie.

529
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,620
When it's time to put down real money,

530
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,660
that's when your true colors show.

531
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,940
Kang Erniu.

532
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,940
Get this straight.

533
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,140
I don't owe you anything.

534
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,780
You insisted on running away
with Wu back then.

535
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,180
I advised you, but did you listen?

536
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,500
You brought this on yourself.

537
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,140
Chu Shaohua, listen,

538
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,420
the person I hate most now
isn't Wu anymore.

539
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,020
It's you!

540
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,540
He just threw me into the water.

541
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,340
You pulled me out of the water,

542
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,780
let me take a breath,

543
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,740
and then pushed me down hard again.

544
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,780
You're even crueler than all of them!

545
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,300
Fine.

546
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,420
Since that's the case,

547
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,700
Kang Erniu,

548
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,820
we're done.

549
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,100
Get lost!

550
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,740
I'm done meddling

551
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,380
in Lu Ningxiang's affairs.

552
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,940
Take care, ma'am.

553
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,380
If you want to make more money,

554
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,940
you can try selling this.

555
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,740
I guarantee it'll earn more than selling

556
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,020
the ointment for a social disease.

557
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,900
Alright.

558
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,620
So, how much commission
will you give me for this?

559
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,500
I'll give you a ten percent commission
for every box you sell.

560
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,260
I'll have to see if it sells well.

561
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,580
Isn't this Mrs. Chen Junior?

562
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,340
Madam Yan,

563
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,660
long time no see.

564
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,820
Are you also here to see a physician?

565
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,660
Not really.

566
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,820
I knew it.

567
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,220
Mr. Zhang and I are discussing business.

568
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Is there something you need?

569
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,500
What a coincidence.

570
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,900
I've got business
to discuss with you too.

571
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,940
Can we talk over there for a second?

572
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,300
Is Shitou making mistakes recently?

573
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,340
It has nothing to do with him.

574
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,380
Are you dissatisfied with Yurong Powder?

575
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
No, it's not.

576
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,180
Yurong Powder is quite effective.

577
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,500
Then what is it about?

578
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,820
Please go ahead.

579
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,460
Ma'am,

580
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,420
are you still planning
to redeem Lu Ningxiang?

581
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,700
Please don't bring her up.

582
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,940
I helped her out of kindness,

583
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,700
but ended up the bad guy.

584
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,020
She lost her head for a moment.

585
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,940
Don't let it ruin your sisterhood.

586
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,220
We have different surnames,

587
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,100
definitely not sisters.

588
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,900
You were even planning
to buy her freedom.

589
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,380
That's quite a deep bond.

590
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,220
She begged me so desperately,

591
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,740
and since we're from the same place,

592
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,900
I just wanted to do the right thing.

593
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
I thought

594
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,180
she was only worth
a few tens of silver dollars.

595
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,620
Who would have thought
her price would be so high?

596
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,460
Ma'am,

597
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,460
if you still want to buy her freedom,

598
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,380
two thousand silver dollars is enough.

599
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,100
I've already told you

600
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,900
I'm not getting involved
in her matters anymore.

601
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,460
Madam Yan, if there's nothing else,

602
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,500
I'll be heading off.

603
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,540
I have to check accounts with others.

604
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,140
Hey, wait.

605
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,260
Fifteen hundred.

606
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,980
One thousand.

607
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,420
Madam Yan,

608
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,140
let me be frank with you.

609
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,860
I was willing to help her before

610
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,340
because I had calculated the costs.

611
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,740
My younger brother back
in the countryside is slow-witted.

612
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,060
Girls from proper families
wouldn't marry him.

613
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,780
I thought

614
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,500
a bit of money

615
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,940
was enough to redeem Lu Ningxiang.

616
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,300
It'd be like finding my brother a wife.

617
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,100
I could manage that cost.

618
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,420
But if you're talking about 1,000,

619
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,540
that's definitely not going to work.

620
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,460
Then,

621
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,700
how much can you offer?

622
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,780
Eighty, perhaps.

623
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,900
I need to save some for their wedding.

624
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,420
Ma'am,

625
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,860
with a price like that,

626
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,180
there's really nothing to talk about.

627
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,860
Well, I've laid all my cards
on the table.

628
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,380
Why don't you make a serious offer too?

629
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,300
Five hundred silver dollars.

630
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,140
Five hundred silver dollars?

631
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,180
If you can't even come up with 500,

632
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,740
I'll find someone else.

633
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
I believe someone
would take Lu Ningxiang

634
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,260
for that price.

635
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,180
Well, 500 silver dollars...

636
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,020
I'll need some time to think it through.

637
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,580
Then it's settled.

638
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,540
Before sunset tomorrow,

639
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,180
you bring the money to Linfang Pavilion.

640
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,060
We'll exchange money for the person.

641
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,100
No, you...

642
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,700
It's settled.

643
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,740
Don't you think that's a little rushed?

644
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,660
These are Qingya Parlor's accounts
for last month.

645
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,780
Please take a look.

646
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,980
Why did you come in person?

647
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,020
Business has been hectic lately.

648
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,220
Shitou's swamped.

649
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,940
Oh, right, Madam Tao.

650
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,940
I've got a friend

651
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,900
who seems to have taken a liking
to Lu Ningxiang from Linfang Pavilion.

652
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,100
He's thinking of buying her freedom.

653
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,980
What do you think would be a fair price?

654
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,940
Lu Ningxiang?

655
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,860
You don't know yet?

656
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,380
Don't know what?

657
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,220
She's about to die.

658
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,900
Mr. Zhao, I appreciate your support.

659
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,620
Thank you, Madam Yan.

660
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,820
Madam Yan.

661
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,940
About Lu Ningxiang,

662
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,860
five hundred silver dollars
is out of the question.

663
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,940
Even if it were 50,

664
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,380
I wouldn't be interested.

665
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,580
What are you saying?

666
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,660
It struck me as odd.

667
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,620
She was priced at 3,000 before,

668
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,900
then suddenly it dropped to 500.

669
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,100
Apparently,
she's contracted a filthy illness.

670
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,180
Her body is decaying,

671
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,060
and the smell is overwhelming.

672
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,020
Even Physician Zhang is at a loss.

673
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,820
And you still told me
to bring the money tomorrow.

674
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,460
You're scared

675
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,740
she won't last another day with you.

676
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,900
Who told you that?

677
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,500
That doesn't matter.

678
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,700
I don't want her anymore.

679
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,300
Let anyone else have her.

680
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,860
Hold on.

681
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,900
Why are you arrogant?

682
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,500
You're taking her,

683
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,540
whether you want to or not.

684
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,700
Who are you?

685
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,220
You don't know Mr. Zhao?

686
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,180
And you're still doing business
around here?

687
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,780
Even if it's Mr. Zhao,

688
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,900
we can't force a sale, can we?

689
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I never

690
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,860
force anyone to buy or sell.

691
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,540
You're the one who wanted her.

692
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,860
You must buy her.

693
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,820
But I asked for someone alive

694
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,780
instead of a dead one.

695
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,460
She's not dead.

696
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,420
Everyone on the street is saying

697
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,820
she's dying.

698
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,140
Doesn't your family

699
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,620
run an apothecary?

700
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,100
Can't you whip up
a couple of doses to help her?

701
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,740
What if it can't be cured?

702
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,220
You can send her back.

703
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,620
Cured or not,

704
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,980
I'm done with her.

705
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,540
Can't I just change my mind?

706
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,660
No way!

707
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,380
I'm telling you,

708
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,900
if you dare to change your mind,

709
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,660
your family can forget

710
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,420
about doing business in this hutong.

711
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,740
Alright.

712
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,340
I can take her.

713
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,180
But I can't pay 500.

714
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,300
I need to save 200 for her medicine.

715
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,820
Then 300 it is.

716
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,780
I have another condition.

717
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,460
Speak.

718
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,900
You have to help me find someone.

719
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,860
Who?

720
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,900
Wu.

721
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,500
Why look for him?

722
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,300
Just don't ask too much.

723
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,260
If I don't ask,
how do you expect me to find him?

724
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,820
He's a distant relative of mine.

725
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,900
His family members want to find him.

726
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,100
I'm just helping to ask.

727
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,460
It's been a long time

728
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,660
since I last saw him.

729
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't know where he is.

730
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,900
You're the famous Mr. Zhao.

731
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,660
You've got a lot of men at your command.

732
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,900
If you want,

733
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,180
you will find him.

734
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,300
The money I'm putting up

735
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,100
to take Lu Ningxiang back

736
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,820
is just a gamble.

737
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,340
All I'm asking

738
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,380
is for you to help me find Wu

739
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,740
and give him to me.

740
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,580
What do you say?

741
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,940
I agree.

742
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,780
But I also have one condition.

743
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,540
If Lu Ningxiang dies here,

I'll accept it.

[Linfang Pavilion]

749
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,980
Do you know someone named Wu?

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,620
Wu?

751
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,380
Yes, he's from Qizhou.

I don't know.

00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,060
She went to many places along the way.

761
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,700
Gambling houses, restaurants, and inns.

762
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,460
She also asked around in other hutongs.

All just to find Wu?

764
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,180
Yes.

765
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,180
Did she say

766
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,100
why she's in such a hurry to find him?

767
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,140
One moment she says Wu is her brother,

768
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,540
that his mother's dying,

769
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,220
and she needs to see him one last time.

770
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,860
Then she turns around
and says Wu is her brother-in-law,

"You have to tell me
why you're looking for him.

Only then can I calculate accurately."

So she told the truth.

What did she say?

She, Wu, and Lu Ningxiang

00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,900
are indeed from the same hometown.

787
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,660
When Wu and Lu Ningxiang

00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,340
they stole a sum of money
from their employer,

She knew Lu Ningxiang was dying,

Three hundred silver dollars for 5,000.

According to your instructions,

I told her

919
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,580
that Ningxiang had contracted
the most dangerous form

920
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,500
of great pox, black pox,

921
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,380
and that it had reached its final stage.

922
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,740
I also said it would be best
to get rid of her as soon as possible,
