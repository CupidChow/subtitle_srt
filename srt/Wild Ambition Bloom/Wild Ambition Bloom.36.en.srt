118
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,370
that would strike anyone as unfair.

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,050

can control the formula.

123
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,410
The shares are negotiable,

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,850
but the formula must be shared.

No room for discussion on this.

126
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,490
Ms. Chu,

127
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,490
only by sharing the formula

128
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,930
can we expedite factory construction,

129
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,900
ramp up mass production,

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
and meet the wartime needs.

131
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,340
But as Mr. Cheng pointed out,

132
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,490
this formula came from my ancestors.

133
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,850
I cannot surrender it lightly.

134
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,810
Things have gotten this bad

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,900
mainly because

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,980
so many cling to self-interest

137
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,050
instead of serving the nation.

138
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,050
I thought

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,850
you were not like

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,460
the rest.

141
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,460
I'm leaving.

142
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,370
If our nation ceases to exist,

143
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,170
what's the use of keeping the formula?

144
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,810
But this isn't negotiation.

145
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,100
It's outright robbery!

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,370
Terms can be negotiated,

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,610
but resisting Japanese aggression
admits no delay.

148
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,170
Shaohua,

149
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,140

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,980
Let's go back.

193
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,180
Mr. Xia,

194
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,890
I'm willing to help you,

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,610
but I don't need

196
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,530
your money.

197
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,340
Very well.

198
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,340
Then let's hear your terms.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,940
I wish to be your true friend.

200
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,300
We've known

201
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,700
each other for over 20 years.

202
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,100
Aren't we true friends?

203
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,460
Our previous connection

204
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,220
was essentially transactional

205
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,820
and mutual exchanges of interest.

206
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,420
What I mean is friendship

207
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,220
where souls intertwine

208
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,220
and we share prosperity

209
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,340
and suffering together.

210
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,650
Do you understand?

211
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,300
Well.

212
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,730
What exactly is your point?

213
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,300
I can have the Japanese Army

214
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,100
return all your branches in northeast

215
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,250
and north China to you,

216
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,700
and help revive your sales
and supply chains.

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,890
But under one condition,

218
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,130
we require 30% of shares

219
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,530
in all those branches.

220
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,730
Relax. You won't be treated unfairly.

221
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,850
We'll purchase

222
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,940
the 30% of shares

223
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,580
at market value.

224
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,890
This is important.

225
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,820
Mr. Komura,

226
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,820
please allow me to think thoroughly.

227
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,220
Besides,

228
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,460
I have another request.

229
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,940
Please say.

230
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,490
Do you recall our last meeting?

231
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,580
I asked for a few TCM formulas,

232
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,420
yet you flatly rejected.

233
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,010
This time,

234
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,730
I hope you'll grant my wish.

235
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,420
A few TCM formulas?

236
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,940
Just one will do.

237
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,890
You mean

238
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,100
the Miracle Pill?

239
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,070
[Jujing Apothecary]

240
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,700
You mustn't agree.

241
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,340
This is the only way
to save Shouyuan Apothecary!

242
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,060
Even if we sacrifice the apothecary,

243
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,370
we cannot let the Japanese
have their way!

244
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,700
Nonsense.

245
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,250
I…

246
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,420
If Shouyuan Apothecary closes down,

247
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,730
we'll lose most of our fortune.

248
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,370
You…

249
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,940
If Shouyuan Apothecary closes down,

250
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,730
it'll be hard
to sustain Jujing Apothecary.

251
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,580
Things will be worse than that.

252
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,180
All our fortune will be gone.

253
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,980
Then we must do something.

254
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,730
The ancients never
compromised ethics for profit,

255
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,220
or abandoned principles
when facing peril.

256
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,980
We can't be worse than them.

257
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,250
Have some water.

258
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,730
Sandu,

259
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,490
tell me what you think.

260
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,980
When we did business

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,010
with the Japanese,

262
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,220
we were criticized behind our backs

263
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,610
by many people for years.

264
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,580
You were removed as the Chairman

265
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,490
of the TCM Guild for that.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,010
These are two separate things.

267
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,220
The removal was the doing

268
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,850
of Mr. Tian and Wen Zhiqiu.

269
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,100
If we let the Japanese invest now,

270
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,940
we'll never rid ourselves of the label
of traitors.

271
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,460
You know nothing.

272
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,850
As the saying goes,

273
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,980
a wise man adapts to the times.

274
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,690
Of those we know,

275
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,930
like Mr. Yang,

276
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,210
he refused the Japanese investment,

277
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,570
so he lost all his fortune overnight

278
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,540
and died in poverty and illness.

279
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,180
Whereas Liu Yutian is more adaptable,

280
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,930
so he has made a fortune,

281
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,660
and obtained a title of nobility.

282
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,500
Don't be so short-sighted!

283
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,260
If the three northeastern provinces
are restored,

284
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,690
he is bound to meet a terrible end.

285
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,810
Come on!

286
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,930
The National Government is incapable!

287
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,900
I doubt
if they can restore the fallen lands.

288
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,660
This matter concerns north China.

289
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,930
They won't back down, I think.

290
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,900
Mr. Xia.

291
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,730
Who are you?

292
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,660
I'm Yu Xinzheng.

293
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,300
Yu Xinzheng?

294
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,610
I don't have any impression of you.

295
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,380
I just graduated not long ago.

296

Yes.

301
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,380
Back then, Zhonghe and I

302
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,090
traveled all the way here from Qizhou.

303
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,330
He endured many hardships on the way.

304

305
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,850

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,570
Yes.

308
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,380

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,730
will also work for you in the future.

Yes, thanks to you,

314
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,210
my father could buy a house here

315
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,780
and I could go to school.

316
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,610
So I hope by working for you

317
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,420

to study abroad in the future.

All other clauses are very clear,

350
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,740
but two key issues remain unclear.

351
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,740
First,

352
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,530
I thought the National Government

353
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,610
is our partner.

354
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,850

Greater China Pharmaceuticals?

356
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,020
I specially asked around and found

357
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,370
it is a private factory,

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,530
What you just mentioned involves

381
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,570
military, national and partisan issues.

382
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,610
To write them into this contract

383
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,460
may arouse unnecessary disputes.

384
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,740
So we will only make a verbal promise,

385
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,290
instead of putting it in writing.

386
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,370
If that's the case,

387
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,660
I'm afraid we cannot sign

388
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,770

389
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,770
Ms. Chu,

390
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,850
the nation is in peril.

391
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
Don't obsess about these details.

392
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,420
Mr. Ma,

393
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,570
this isn't a matter of details;

394
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,460
it's a matter of principle.

395
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,530
Ms. Chu,

396
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,770
are you going back on your word?

397
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,090
On the contrary,

398
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,090
you are going back on yours.

399
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,460
Mr. Cheng,

400
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,460
may I have a word with Ms. Chu alone?

401
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,290
Ms. Chu,

402
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,260
as long as

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,660
you are willing to sign,

404
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,980
we'll give you

405
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,180
50% of shares.

406
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm not asking for shares,

407
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,330
but for you to put the commitment
to resist Japan,

408
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,500
into effect in black and white.

409
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,740
Well, I can't agree to this.

410

Then please have someone

411
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,220

come and negotiate with me.

413

414
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,130
it is your honor to serve

415
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,290
the people and the country.

416
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,500
Mr. Ma,

417
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,940
to serve the country and the people,

418
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,940
I am willing to donate all my property.

419
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,700
But I fear that some people,

420
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,980
under the banner of patriotism,

421
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,980

422
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,420
Well, Ms. Chu,

423
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,570
do you know who the real shareholder

424
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,570
of Greater China Pharmaceuticals is?

425
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,090
Of course, I do.

426
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,850
Because I know that,

427
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,180
I don't believe a single word

428
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,330
of their verbal promise.

429
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,090
Then you should know better

430
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,420
the consequences of offending them.

431
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,700
I do.

432
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,260
In that case,

have any connection with the Xia family.

Even if she were,

468

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,980
I planned

571
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,460
to learn from him

572
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,810
and use his money

573
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,530
and his influence

574
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,660
to start a business.

575
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,570
But that was never going to work.

576
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,900
I expected

577
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,700
his wife can't stand me.

578
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,530
But he

579
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,850
never took me seriously.

580
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,260
Since this way didn't work,

581
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,130
try another one.

582
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,050
What options do I have?

583
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,660
I'm too old now.

584
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,370
Nobody hires me for films anymore.

585
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,810
Start a business?

586
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,850
I don't have the capital for that.

587
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,180
Get a job?

588
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,770
But I can't handle hard labor.

589
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,290
Marry someone?

590
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,700
With my reputation,

591
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,740
no man would ever want me.

592
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,740

593
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,370
Erniu,

594
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,740
why don't you join me instead?

595
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,900
Join you?

596
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,660
You helped Xia Yuan sell drugs,

597
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,460
so you can help sell mine!

598
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,330
Could I be useful to you?

Beyond the salary,

603
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,700
you'll receive 10% of shares.

604
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,530
I don't have funds to buy back shares.

605
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,700
You've paid far more than enough.

Years ago,

607
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,940
I needed capital desperately to launch

608
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,460
Shaohua Pharmaceuticals.

609
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,220
Just when I was at my wits' end,

610
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,610
someone paid 80,000 silver dollars

611
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,180
for my house
worth 40,000 silver dollars,

612
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,420
saving me from disaster.

613
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,770
That person turned out to be you.

614
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,850
How did you find out?

615
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,090
I've been wary

616
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:35,980
of things that seem too good

617
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,090
to be true,

618
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,370
so I looked into it.

619
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,980
Turns out it wasn't a gift from heaven

620
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,130
nor a hidden snare.

621
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,850
But your kindness toward me.

622
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,500
All along, you knew.

623
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,850
You never brought it up,

624
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,220
so neither did I.

625
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,220
But now,

626
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,260
it's time for me

627
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,810
to return your kindness.

628
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,740
But

629
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,420
it's far too much.

Not at all!

631

But for your help,

632
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,980
Shaohua Pharmaceuticals wouldn't exist.

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,260
Our dozen-year friendship

634

can't be measured by money.

Next,

I'll open branch factories

646

will you forgive me?

has taken an odd turn?

667

Mr. Xia has his reasons.

bothers me.

he will let the Japanese join us?

If they don't,

676

we're all dead anyway.

677
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,530
So be it! This is the worst time.

678
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,050
We may start over from scratch.

If push comes to shove,

683

we could go back to farming.

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,130
Perhaps

760
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,090
they did tell you,

761
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:51,730
yet

762
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,500
you forgot.

763
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,090
Or perhaps

764
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,770
you spun some yarn

765
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,860
about old days on a whim.

766
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,380
Seems you refuse to buy into this.

767
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,130
Why should I own up

768
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,820
to baseless claims?

769
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,170
No worries.

770
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,860
All proof exists.

771
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,960
[Contract]

772
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,820
If this contract holds true,

773
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,050
the Miracle Pill's formula

774
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,170
must be in your hands now.

775
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,170
Why did you

776
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,540
come by today?

777
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,610
Here's the thing.

778
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,980
Back then Shaozhong held

779
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,420
exclusive rights to that formula.

780
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,500
When we drew up the contract,

781
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,730
he was under arrest.

782
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,090
Your mother took the money,

783
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,050
but couldn't give the formula to me.

784
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,860
Later when Shaozhong was released,

785
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,650
I was too preoccupied

786
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,170
as I mistakenly believed
Xia Chu's death.

787
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,300
Then the business boomed

788
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,920
and I just forgot about it.

789
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,780
Recently,

790
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,730
Gao fled here,

791
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,020
bringing some documents

792
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,940
from Shouyuan Apothecary.

793
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,340
Only then did I remember this.

794
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,130
So

795
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,860
you came today

796
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,380
seeking the formula.

797
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,860
Though decades have passed,

798
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,730
luckily, all documents

799
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,980
remain intact.

800
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,340
I hope you'll

801
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,690
transfer the formula to me

802
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,610
to honor the contract.

803
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,300
Though the documents appear intact,

804
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,460
I just don't buy it.

805
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,130
You're denying your mother's thumbprint?

806
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,050
She passed away years ago.

807
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,020
There's simply no way

808
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,650
to verify its authenticity.

809
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,780
Fine!

810
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,530
What about Zhou Yan's,

811
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,500
Mr. Xia's, Gao's

812
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,610
or even Anke Hall's Lei Yuting's?

813
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,900
Can they be fake?

814
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,460
It's easy to forge a fake certificate!

815
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,460
You…

816
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,170
Hongnian.

817
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,860
Ms. Chu,

818
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,940
I utterly understand your feelings.

819
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,730
The success of the Miracle Pill

820
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,420
stems from its miraculous formula,

821
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,940
and your tireless efforts.

822
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,940
How about this?

823
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,780
I'm willing to cede

824
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,650
half of its rights to you.

825
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,610
Exactly 50%.

826
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,210
That's my utmost sincerity shown.

827
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,570
I also hope to see yours reflected.

828
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,250
Mine

829
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,900
means one thing.

830
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,780
The Miracle Pill belongs
to the Chu family.

831
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,860
It has nothing to do with you.

832
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,730
If that's your stance,

833
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,900
we'll settle this in court.

834
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,460
Suit yourself.

835
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,300
Fine.

836
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,780
Once this hits court,

837
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,570
your claim

838
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,020
gets wiped clean to zero.

839
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,780
Best cash out while you're ahead.

840
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:36,170
Or you'll end up with nothing.

841
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,130
The Miracle Pill

842
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,090
is striking gold,

843
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,780
so he wants a slice of profits.

844
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,980
What he's after isn't a slice,

845
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,900
but half the pie.

846
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,420
Is that document genuine?

847
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,210
I can't tell yet.

848
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,090
Since even you can't tell,

849
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,050
we'll flatly declare it fake,

850
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,690
leaving him no choice.

851
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,050
Yi Dajin is missing now,

852
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,500
but the thumbprints
of Xia Yuan and Gao Qianyi

853
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,530
seem authentic.

854
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,860
I'm afraid the court rulings

855
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,380
might favor them.

856
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,940
What date does it say
for the court session?

857
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,380
On the 15th day from now.

858
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,860
Erniu,

859
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,460
lend me a hand?

860
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,050
Go find Zhou Yan.

861
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,690
Even if she refuses to testify,

862
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,460
just get her thumbprint.

863
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,170
No problem.

864
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,610
Cheng Hui,

865
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,340
book me a ticket

866
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,650
to Peking tomorrow.

867
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,340
Okay.

868
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,020
You're heading back?

869
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,020
I want to go back to Qizhou.

870
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,250
If Shaozhong

871
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,730
still keeps old documents,

872
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,250
everything will be easily solved.

873
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,420
Before heading back,

874
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,780
I need to see someone else.

875
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,340
Alright, see you.

876
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,130
Mr. Gao.

877
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,420
Ms. Chu,

878
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,900
what brings you here?

879
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,860
I've been waiting for you.

880
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,900
What can I do for you?

881
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,650
I'd like to ask you thoroughly

882
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,610
about my mother
selling Chicun Apothecary's signboard.

883
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,650
I can't recall clearly.

884
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,690
Can't recall

885
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,500
or can't discuss it?

886
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,250
Think whatever you will.

887
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,300
If my mother

888
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,020
sold the formula

889
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:42,940
to Mr. Xia back then,

890
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,730
I'll honor that contract.

891
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,300
But with so many doubts now,

892
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,340
I have to get to the bottom of this.

893
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,650
You

894
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,380
should go to Mr. Xia instead.

895
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,860
He knows the details better.
