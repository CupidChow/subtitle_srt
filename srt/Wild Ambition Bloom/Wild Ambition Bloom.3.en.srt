Almost.

This tastes authentic.

I just want you
to keep going, for yourself.

Mr. Xia,

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,660
you didn't invite me here

67
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,220
just to talk business, did you?

68
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,180
This is about Shaohua, isn't it?

69
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes.

Please, let Shaohua go.

Dashun, what are you doing?

74

I'll let him know
what propriety and integrity mean.

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,100
We're not rich

76
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
or powerful,

77
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,540
but I can give her

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,660
a life with dignity!

79
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,380
I'll never let her go hungry
or be worn out by life.

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,740
But is this what she wants?

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,300
You've lived with her all this time,

82
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,100
but do you know who she really is?

83
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,980
Do you think
she's just an ordinary woman?

84
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,900
You think walls and rules
can keep her in?

85
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,460
What if I told you

86
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,740
I wanted to leave this place

87
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,180
to see what's out there?

88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,780
Mr. Chen,

89
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,780
if you care for her,

90
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
let her go.

91
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,140
I swear, I could kill you right now.

92
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,820
Enough.

93
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,420

Just a piece of furniture?

96
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,860
I don't need anyone to let me go.

97
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,340
If I want out,

98
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,700
no one's stopping me.

99
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,500
I don't need saving either.

100
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,220
Whether I fall or rise

101
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,740
is up to me.

102
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
No one else gets a say in this.

103
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,100
It's my life.

104
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,060
I make the calls.

105
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,020
What's this?

106
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,340
Save at home, spend on the road.

107
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,060
I know

108
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,820
you don't care for the jewelry
I bought you.

109
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,900
But take it with you anyway.

110
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,180
If you ever run short
while you're out there,

111
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,780
you can sell it and get by.

112
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,340
Dashun,

113
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,300
what do you mean by this?

114
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,140
You've always been so proud

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,260
and strong-willed.

116
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,020
The Xia family is not like ours.

117
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,020
They are of high status,

118
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,940
and scrutiny follows.

119
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,300
When you go there,

120
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,300
you must restrain yourself.

121
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,580
Don't always try to stand out

122
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,980
or get the upper hand in everything.

123
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,780
Shaohua,

124
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,500
your resolve

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,860
is a match for any man

126
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,820
and a challenge to most.

127
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
As the saying goes,

128
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,820
too much rigidity breaks,

129
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,580
while softness endures.

130
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,860
A good match needs balance

131
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,180
between yin and yang,

132
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,220
strength and softness.

133
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,420
Therefore,

134
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,340
once you're married to Xia Chu,

135
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,900
learn when to soften.

136
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,740
Chen Dashun,

137
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,700
do you know what you're saying?

138
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,020
Xia Chu said

139
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,740
he's waiting for you at Lianglukou.

140
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,100
I never said I was going with him.

141
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,900
Tomorrow morning,

142
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,820
I'll take you there.

143
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,820
So, you're

144
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,820
really sending me away?

145
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,820
You could say that.

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,500
Don't you want to go with him?

147
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,540
I know you.

148
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Even if you want to leave,

149
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,660
you won't,

150
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,460
because you'd

151
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,940
feel guilty about me.

152
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,860
I could ask you to stay,

153
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,180
but what's the point?

154
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,700
Shaohua,

155
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,740
I've always known

156
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,100
that I am

157
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,700
not good enough for you.

158
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,100
Don't talk nonsense.

159
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,380
You are the most perfect girl

160
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,620
I have ever met.

161
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,740
Smart, capable, and brave.

162
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,900
And I, on the other hand, am

163
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,380
a very ordinary man.

164
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,780
Dashun,

165
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,540
everyone around here

166
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,980
knows I married up.

167
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,460
Those people

168
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,620
only care about who's wealthy

169
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,540
and who's not.

170
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,980
They don't see how priceless you are.

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,340
If it hadn't been
for Shaozhong's accident,

172
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,620
I might never have found my way to you.

173
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,140
Actually,

174
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,060
you and Xia Chu

175
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,420
are truly

176
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,780
a perfect match.

177
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,180
That's not true.

178
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,780
Dashun,

179
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,460
Sorry, I...

180
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,740
I should be the one apologizing.

181
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,700
You were meant to marry him

182
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,460
but ended up with me.

183
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,060
It's my fault.

184
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,180
No, you're more than enough.

185
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,460
Shaohua, honestly,

186
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,700
with someone like me,

187
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,740
getting to spend this much time

188
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,060
with you

189
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,580
is already a gift from above.

190
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,260
So,

191
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,620
I can't be greedy anymore.

192
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,180
Dashun.

193
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,980
Shaohua,

194
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,580
thank you

195
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,460
for every moment of joy
you brought into my life.

196
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,540
I owe you too much.

197
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
So I'm giving you

198
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,380
your freedom.

199
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,900
You feel everything so deeply,
and you never hold back.

200
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,940
And I reckon Xia Chu

201
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,180
is just as headstrong.

202
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,660
You're both made for big things.

203
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,420
But

204
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,900
that kind of fire can bring trouble.

205
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,580
So when needed,

206
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,620
you have to hold him back.

207
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,820
Charging ahead isn't always the answer.

208
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,740
Dashun.

209
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,180
[Tongda Carriage Depot]

210
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,020
Dashun!

211
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
Dashun!

212
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,260
Open the door!

213
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,060
Why are you keeping the door closed
in broad daylight?

214
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,900
And you won't even speak?

215
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,500
Dashun!

216
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,300
Hope nothing bad happened.

217
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,580
What's going on?

218
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,020
He's moving, Mother.

219
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,420
Is he drunk?

220
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
Drunk in broad daylight?

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,220
Dashun.

222
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,380
Mother, maybe he's possessed.

223
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,620
Oh, shut up.

224
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,660
Where's Shaohua?

225
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,500
I didn't see her.

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,300
What's happening?

227
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,580
Darling.

228
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,060
Father.

229
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,780
Dashun locked himself inside
and won't come out.

230
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,500
Seriously, in broad daylight?

231
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,860
We've been calling him,
but he's not answering.

232
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,140
Dashun!

233
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,660
Dashun!

234
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,100
And Shaohua isn't here.

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,820
Go get me an axe.

236
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,420
Do you think something

237
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,580
might have happened to him?

238
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,220
Shaohua?

239
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Shaohua's back.

240
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,780
Where have you been?

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,580
What's that

242
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,260
she's carrying?

243
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,500
To leave

244
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,140
or to stay

245
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,420
is my call.

246
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,780
Shaohua.

247
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,260
Here.

248
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,740
Don't you want to see the world outside?

249
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,300
I'll go there myself.

250
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,900
I believe

251
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,580
someday,

252
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,420
I'll make it there on my own.

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,580
Even if

254
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,820
it's tough,

255
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,420
wears me out,

256
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,260
or takes time,

257
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,540
I don't mind.

258
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,660
Have a safe journey.

259
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,700
Shaohua!

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,860
Put me down.

No, I'm so happy.

262
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,020

We've arrived in Peking.

291
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,500
Look at these buildings, so tall.

292
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,420
The roads are so broad.

293
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,980
Who are these people?

294
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Foreigners.

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,180
These are foreigners?

296
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,820
I've heard
they don't mind getting violent.

297
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,020
And they eat people, no joke.

298
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,300
For real?

299
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,420
- Another one!
- Bravo!

300
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,620
- Wonderful!
- Splendid!

301
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,420
Mother.

302
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,340
This courtyard's smaller
than the one at our old house.

303
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,140
But no matter what,

304
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,500
we've finally settled down in Peking.

305
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,500
New house, new rules.

306
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,380
Not one gets skipped.

307
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,780
Shaohua, listen carefully.

308
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,300
Let me take that, Shaohua.

309
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,180
Mother, I'm listening.

310
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,180
First rule:

311
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,980
Without my permission, neither of you

312
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,820
steps outside this courtyard,

313
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,900
not even outside the gate.

314
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,800
Second rule:

315
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,660
Even if I say yes,

316
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,380
you're not going out alone.

317
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,820
Someone must go with you. Always.

318
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,260
Mother, don't worry.

319
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,820
Even if you let me go out alone,

320
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
I wouldn't.

321
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Third rule:

322
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
Without my permission,

323
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,300
you cannot speak to others,

324
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
not even a single word.

325
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,620
Fourth rule:

326
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,260
When outsiders come to our house,

327
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,060
stay inside.

328
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
Fifth rule:

329
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,060
You two need to pitch in
without being asked.

330
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,060
Your father-in-law
expects his meals on time.

331
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
For that perfect sweet and sour flavor,

332
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,540
just remember:
one, two, three, four, five.

333
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,420
One spoon of cooking wine,

334
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,260
two of soy sauce,

335
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,660
three of sugar, four of vinegar,
and five of water. That's it.

336
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,940
One spoon of cooking wine,

337
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,420
two of...

338
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,740
What was it again?

339
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Soy sauce.

340
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,180
Seriously, my memory's a mess.

341
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,300
It's okay.

342
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,740
I'll

343
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,220
write it down for you.

344
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,820
I'm illiterate.

345
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,820
Then I'll teach you a few more times.

346
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,460
How about I draw it for you?

347
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,580
Shaohua,

348
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,060
you're so good to me.

349
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,460
Come over, I'll teach you
how to knead dough.

350
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,100
Okay.

351
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,620
You used up both silver dollars?

352
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,500
Add some more flour.

353
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,780
Yeah.

354
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,420
And this is all you've got?

355
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,260
I even chipped in a few copper coins.

356
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,260
Ershun,

357
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,020
that was supposed to last a whole month.

358
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,420
That was back at our old place.

359
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,860
This is Peking.

360
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,340
Things cost way more here.

361
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,580
To be blunt,

362
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
you breathe the air,
and they'll find a way to charge you.

363
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,940
Seriously.

364
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,460
Did you take the money

365
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,220
to do something else?

366
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,140
Absolutely not!

367
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,340
You definitely did.

368
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,380
If you don't believe me,

369
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,060
don't ask me to do it.

370
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,020
I won't bother anymore.

371
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,020
Next time, go yourself.

372
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,820
Fine! I'll do it myself!

373
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,860
Tell me,

374
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,260
how do I get to the wet market?

375
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,300
Mother,

376
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,540
I'm only going to say this once, okay?

377
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,860
Go left out of the hutong,

378
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,660
walk east for dozens of steps,
then turn left again.

379
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,380
Pass through Shijia Hutong.

380
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,500
Then, when you see an intersection,

381
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,860
take the southwest path.

382
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,380
Walk for another few dozen steps,

383
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,140
go around a big puddle,

384
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,020
walk two steps north, and you're there.

385
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,700
Mother,

386
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,340
I've drawn the map

387
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,100
to the market for you.

388
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,500
Put it over there.

389
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,460
Shaohua.

390
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,620
Check out this fabric.

391
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,060
If I turned it into a sachet,

392
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,820
wouldn't it look kind of plain?

393
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,380
Mother, why are you asking me?

394
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,420
You know I don't have much taste.

395
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,140
Yours is way better.

396
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,940
I'll go refill your tea.

397
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,620
What a waste of this fabric.

398
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,500
Mother,

399
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,460
here, have some tea.

400
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Careful, it's hot.

401
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,100
Mother, I'm sorry.

402
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,420
My hand slipped and...

403
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,580
How many times have I told you?

404
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
Can you at least behave

405
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,460
like someone from a decent family?

406
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,220
You're clumsy all the time.

407
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,540
Look what you did to my dress.

408
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,140
I literally just put it on!

409
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,060
Mother,

410
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,420
why don't you

411
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,500
change into a fresh one

412
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,580
and take this off?

413
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,060
I'll wash it tonight.

414
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,260
Once it's dry and ironed tomorrow,
I'll bring it right back to you.

415
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,020
Help me up!

416
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,020
Okay.

417
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,340
You're really something.

418
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,340
I didn't expect it.

419
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,260
Really.

420
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,660
It really caught me off guard.

421
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,700
Honestly.

422
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,140
What's the holdup?

423
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
Mother isn't back yet.

424
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,180
It's so late already.

425
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,740
Why don't you go ahead and eat first?

426
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,820
When you're done,

427
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,580
bring the food to Father and Dashun.

428
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,940
Shaohua,

429
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,340
your hands are magic.

430
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,180
This is so tasty.

431
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,340
It's Ping's cooking.

432
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,900
Her?

433
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,460
Shaohua showed me how.

434
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,460
So it's still Shaohua, isn't it?

435
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh, Ershun,

436
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,060
is our apothecary far from here?

437
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Not far, it's on Fuma Street.

438
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,940
Where has Mother gone?

439
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,380
She's out picking up some groceries.

440
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,860
When did she leave?

441
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,460
She left before dawn.

442
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,180
She should be back by now.

443
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,820
The market is less than three li
from here.

444
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,380
Could something have gone wrong?

445
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,540
Could Mother be taken away and eaten
by some foreigners?

446
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,980
If anyone was getting eaten,
it'd be you first.

447
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,020
Finally, I'm home.

448
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,860
I'm home.

449
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,940
At last.

450
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,020
Someone!

451
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,900
Ershun!

452
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,340
Ershun!

453
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Mother.

454
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,060
What happened?

455
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,460
Ershun, I almost didn't make it back!

456
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,540
Why are you standing there?

457
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,860
Get her a hot towel.

458
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,900
What exactly happened?

459
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,380
Seriously, what did you do?

460
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,500
I swear, I could slap you right now!

461
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,020
What kind of map was that?

462
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,740
From home to the market, of course.

463
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,620
I followed that map

464
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,860
and kept getting more and more lost.

465
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,100
I ended up so far out

466
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
that there wasn't a single person
in sight.

467
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,460
I was

468
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,700
so scared.

469
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,980
I figured I should turn,

470
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,780
and the moment I did,

471
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,580
oh my goodness,
a foreigner popped out of nowhere!

472
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,860
And he actually spoke to me!

473
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,220
I...

474
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,540
They eat people.

475
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,100
Yes, I was terrified.

476
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,980
So I

477
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,260
ran as fast as I could.

478
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,540
I didn't even notice my shoes fell off.

479
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,540
I just ran with all my might

480
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,180
towards where there were people.

481
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,540
Later, I met someone

482
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,500
who told me

483
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,980
the direction I was going

484
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,700
was completely wrong.

485
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,340
So where did you end up going?

486
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,620
I...

487
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,100
I don't know!

488
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,820
How did you get back?

489
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,580
Nonsense!

490
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,420
I remembered the name of our hutong!

491
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,580
So I just...

492
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,220
Luckily, I remembered.

493
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,060
So I

494
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
came back all the way like that.

495
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,700
Ugh, I'm completely worn out!

496
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,300
Mother, you've been through a lot.

497
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,940
Yes, I'm exhausted!

498
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Ershun, this is all on you!

499
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,220
You went the wrong way,
and it's my fault?

500
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,100
You messed up that map on purpose,

501
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,940
so I couldn't find the market!

502
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,180
Let me see that map.

503
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,060
It went missing.

504
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,460
I don't even know when I lost it.

505
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,500
How can you blame me for this, really?

506
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,260
Alright, Ershun.

507
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,820
If she says so, that's how it is.

508
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,460
She's just dumb.

509
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,340
Are you done eating?

510
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,620
If you are, go take the food
to Father and the others.

511
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,060
Come on!

512
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,140
What are you dawdling for?

513
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,860
Your father is waiting for this meal.

514
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,340
I was just waiting for you, wasn't I?

515
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,940
Quick, he's waiting for his food.

516
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,140
Such an idiot.

517
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,180
Don't just stand there.

518
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Get me my tobacco pipe.

519
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,140
I want to have a puff.

520
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,500
Here.

521
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,060
Listen, Ershun

522
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,100
did it on purpose.

523
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
He doesn't want me to find that market.

524
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
That way,

525
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,060
only he gets to buy groceries.

526
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,020
So

527
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,780
he can pocket two silver dollars
from me every single day.

528
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,660
Ershun?

529
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,180
No way.

530
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,380
Don't you know?

531
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,220
For the first few years,
he was helping out at the apothecary.

532
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,020
His accounts were a mess,

533
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
and he had sticky fingers.

534
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,140
So his father sent him home

535
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,220
to reflect on what he'd done.

536
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,420
Why am I even telling you this?

537
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,860
Mother, are you still going
to buy groceries tomorrow?

538
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,220
Do you have any idea

539
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,700
how scared I was today?

540
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,100
Then Ershun will go.

541
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,700
No.

542
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,500
Even the richest family

543
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,060
couldn't afford the way
he blows through money.

544
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,140
But our family's rice, flour, and oil

545
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,700
are only enough for today.

546
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,900
What should we do?

547
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,100
What if

548
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,820
I go tomorrow instead?

549
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,180
You can't go.

550
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,140
If you're not home,
who will cook the meals

551
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,700
and who will do the housework?

552
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,140
Ping can do it.

553
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,700
That stuff she made?

554
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,740
I could barely get it down.

555
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,220
Mother, you have no idea,

556
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,180
she's gotten pretty good at cooking.

557
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,060
Even Ershun complimented her today.

558
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,980
Yes, Mother.

559
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,820
I learned all of Shaohua's
cooking magic.

560
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,700
I can do it.

561
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:23,980
Mother,

562
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
I mean,

563
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,860
with two daughters-in-law at home,

564
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,540
shouldn't you be living
the easy life by now?

565
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,380
Mother, how about

566
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,740
I give it a shot tomorrow?

567
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,100
If I can't do it,

568
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,980
we can think of other ways then.

569
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,860
Alright then.

570
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,740
You go tomorrow.

571
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,060
- Excellent!
- Bravo!

572
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,540
- Again!
- One more!

573
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,420
- Good!
- Well done!

574
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,100
- Splendid!
- Nice job!

575
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,500
Excuse me.

576
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,740
The ladies from those mansions

577
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,100
all ask for this piping.

578
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,420
They're all learning from us.

579
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,780
Next time we get clothes made
at Shoude Garment,

580
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,060
we should get them to lower the price.

581
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,340
That makes sense.

[Chen's Apothecary]

Dashun.

584
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,780
Why are you here?

585
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,100
Mother told me to buy groceries.

586
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,020
I thought I'd drop by.

587
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,220
How did you find this place?

588
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,740
Ershun told me about Fuma Street,

589
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,180
so I

590
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
found my way here.

591
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
You're pregnant

592
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,620
and still going everywhere.

593
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,660
Doesn't that wear you out?

594
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,740
Not really.

595
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,540
What is this?

596
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,420
That's a newspaper.

597
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,620
A newspaper?

598
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,260
What's it for?

599
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,660
What's it for?

600
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,420
It is very useful.

601
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,580
Look.

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,020
This section

603
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,260
is all about important events

604
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,220

what was right, what went wrong,

608
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,300
and it lays everything out very clearly.

609
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,540

[Xinmin Gold Pen]

612
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,500
What is this?

613
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,740
This is called a fountain pen.

614
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,820
Fountain pen.

615
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,460
Can it also write?

616
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,980
Yes, I heard

617
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,580
that if you can use a brush pen,
you can handle a fountain pen.

618
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,580
You can also carry it with you anywhere.

619
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,420
It's a pity

620
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,540
that I haven't used this either.

621
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
How interesting.

622
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,460
What are the formulas used
for these prepared medicines?

623
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,300
They're all traditional formulas
passed down through generations.

624
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,260
You... No,

625
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,820
don't we have our own formulas?

626
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,900
We're really at a disadvantage here.

627
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,940
We don't have our exclusive remedies.

628
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,540
So our business

629
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,780
has always been stagnant.

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,420
This has Father pretty worried.

632
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Yes, Mr. Zhou.

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,140
Please wait a moment.
I'll get them for you.

634
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,140
Okay.

Hello, Mr. Zhou.

636
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,980
Hello.

637
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,500
That'll be 4.2.

638
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,860

just let us know.

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,380
Mr. Zhou,

644
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,500
here are the honeyed pills you wanted.

645
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,740
The dryness has been completely removed.

646
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,500
Please use them with confidence.

647
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,060
Thank you.

648
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,180
Mr. Zhou, if it's Qi deficiency,
go with the one above.

649
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,580
If it's blood deficiency,
use the one below.

650
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,900
If it's both,

651
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,380
just take them together.

652
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,300
Got it.

653
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,420
Your wife's so kind.

654
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,980
She suggested

655
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,500
a few good pairings
for the honeyed pills.

656
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,300
It's what we're supposed to do.

657
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm leaving.

658
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,260
Take care.

659
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,540
Take care, Mr. Zhou.

660
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,620
Are you that amazing?

661
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,340
In just this short amount of time,

662
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,780
you sold these

663
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,700
most expensive tonics?

664
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,340
Yes.

665
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,260
How did you do it?

666
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,340
I asked him why he wanted
to customize honeyed pills.

667
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,500
He said someone in his family
wasn't feeling well.

668
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,420
I said these pills
only treat the symptoms.

669
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,340
If combined with those other items,

670
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,500
it cannot only treat the root cause

671
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,940
but also be twice as effective.

672
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,340
And he'd save a lot of money
on tonics for the year.

673
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,220
Once he did the math,
he bought them all.

674
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,380
Shaohua, you're so good at business.

675
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,900
My grandfather taught me all of this.

676
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,980
You're really amazing.

677
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,940
Believe it or not,

678
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,660
these tonics

679
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,620
used to sit on the shelf forever.

680
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,180
Father and I

681
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,420
were going to sell them at a loss.

682
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,180
Since I'm so good,

683
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,780
why don't you let me help every day?

684
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,500
That won't do.

685
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,220
Why?

686
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,940
I just don't want you
to wear yourself out.

687
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,020
I'll be fine.

688
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,060
Once the apothecary gets busy,

689
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,460
you won't even have time
for a sip of water.

690
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,500
But I find it very interesting.

691
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,180
In Peking,

692
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,020
there aren't many apothecaries
that employ female staff.

693
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,620
The newspapers say that even banks

694
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,460
are now using female accountants.

695
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,580
Why can't apothecaries use female staff?

696
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,740
Dashun, listen.

697
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,380
If I could help here every day,

698
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,740
we could go to work
and come home together.

699
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,460
That's true.

700
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,580
Exactly! And you'd get
to see me every day.

701
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,860
Isn't that good?

702
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,420
Of course it is.

703
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,580
So you'll agree then.

704
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,980
Not that it matters.

705
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,340
Father's the one who decides.

706
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,220
It's already so late,

707
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,580
and you're just getting home?

708
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
Where on earth have you been?

709
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
I've told you to carry yourself

710
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,780
like a proper daughter-in-law
from a respectable family.

711
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,700
You've only been out for a few days,

712
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,420
and you're already making
the same mistake again.

713
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,060
Mother, I'm late.

714
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,260
This is the change I got back today.

715
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,380
It's only been a day,

716
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,140
and you bought so much food.

717
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,500
Is everything in Peking this cheap now?

718
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,180
Mother,

719
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,740
it depends on the place.

720
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,740
The place Ershun mentioned

721
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,700
was indeed too expensive.

722
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,220
So I asked around

723
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,220
and found another place.

724
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,940
The distance is twice as far,

725
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,420
but the price

726
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,580
is at least half off.

727
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,180
That's why I'm late.

728
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,420
It's fine.

729
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,380
As long as you're back.

730
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,780
Why aren't you eating?

731
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,220
It's all here.

732
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,980
Thanks, Shaohua.

733
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,340
I have no appetite.

734
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,660
Mother, you go ahead.

735
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,340
I'm going back.

736
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,980
What's wrong with you?
Are you not feeling well?

737
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,100
- Dashun.
- I'm fine.

738
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,820
I'm fine, Mother.

739
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,940
Are you sick?

740
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm fine.

741
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,260
No.

742
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,140
Mother,

743
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,820
I think I'm just really tired.

744
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,940
You were fine a while ago,

745
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,700
how come you're so worn out now?

746
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,660
Father's been away,

747
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,340
so I've had to run the apothecary
all by myself.

748
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,220
The raw medicinal stock
we ordered just came in.

749
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,140
Some need to be soaked,

750
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,820
some need to be washed with water,

751
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,540
and some need to be ground and sliced.

752
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,340
I also have to manage the front hall.

753
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,180
How could I not be tired?

754
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,740
Even so,

755
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,420
I've only processed
less than half of the stock.

756
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,780
You're doing all this by yourself?

757
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,020
Aren't there two assistants?

758
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,700
Don't even mention it.

759
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,740
One gave the excuse of family issues,

760
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
the other said he wasn't feeling well.

761
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,020
Ershun,

762
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,260
listen,

763
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,460
go to the apothecary tomorrow

764
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,660
and take care of that batch
of raw medicinal stock.

765
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,460
Mother,

766
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,220
I've been coughing for several days.

767
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,180
I just saw the physician

768
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,100
and was told not to sweat
or catch a cold.

769
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,140
Is that so?

770
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,060
Remember to boil the medicine.

771
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,460
Mother, let me be clear,

772
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,460
I can't do it.

773
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,620
I'm pregnant

774
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,700
and I can't be too tired.

775
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,940
None of you can help?

776
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,340
You're really going to let Dashun
take it all on himself?

777
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,060
Honestly, Mother,

778
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,300
it's just a bit more money

779
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,860
to bring in two extra hands.

780
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,260
Easier said than done.

781
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,100
Where would the money come from?

782
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,660
Mother, it's fine.

783
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,300
Father might be back in half a month.

784
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,140
I think I can hold out

785
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,540
for another half a month.

786
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,420
In half a month, you'd be...

787
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,500
You're helping
at the apothecary tomorrow.

788
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,660
Mother, no need.

789
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,740
Just let Shaohua

790
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,820
rest at home.

791
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,860
How can that be?

792
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,060
There's so much work.

793
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,020
What if she strains her back?

794
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,940
Then I'd be so heartbroken.

795
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,020
She's not so delicate.

796
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,780
I was nearly due

797
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,340
with you,

798
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,580
and your grandma still had me
out there working the fields.

799
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,220
It's settled then.
You're going tomorrow.

800
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,060
Have another bite.

801
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,660
Dashun, you need to eat more.

802
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,540
Stop acting. No one's watching.

803
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,140
Okay.

804
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:22,980
What's wrong?

805
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,980
Have a seat.

806
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,780
Are you feeling nauseous again?

807
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,300
Oh, that reminds me.

808
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,000
[Ledger]

809
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,020
The other day,
you were always feeling nauseous

810
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,100
and couldn't eat anything.

811
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,020
So I asked someone

812
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,060
to get a prescription
from Mr. Wang Fengchun.

813
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,540
I used the finest Baizhu, dried ginger,

814
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,940
Banxia, Juhong, and Houpo
[*Chinese herbal medicines]

815
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,420
to make you an anti-nausea sachet.

816
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,300
Feeling better now, right?

817
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,580
You sewed this yourself, didn't you?

818
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
Yes.

819
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,980
I can tell by the stitches.

820
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,900
Are they a bit messy?

821
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,780
Dashun,

822
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,420
thank you.

823
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,980
Let me put it on you.

824
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,580
It's fine, I'll put it on myself.

825
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
That's all right.

826
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,780
Shaohua,

827
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,740
sorry you've had to go through all this.

828
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,100
Don't be sorry. I'm fine.

829
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,140
Dashun,

830
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,100
let's make another batch
of these sachets.

831
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,660
This way, not only people
with morning sickness,

832
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,420
but also those suffering
from travel sickness

833
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,940
and summer heat can benefit from it.

834
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,740
Even now,

835
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,460
you're still thinking
about how to make money.

836
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,420
Can't you just get some proper rest?

837
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,300
I just want to help others.

838
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,940
Alright.

839
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,780
I'll do what you say, okay?

840
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,880
[Chen's Apothecary]

841
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,820
Do you recognize medicinal materials?

842
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,140
I want to learn how.

843
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,540
Very well.

844
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,460
Let's start with identifying
medicinal materials.

845
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,460
Excuse me.

846
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,100
Hello.

847
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,540
Sir,

848
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,140
can I help you?

849
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,140
I've tried several apothecaries.

850
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,540
None of them could prepare this formula.

851
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,540
Can you

852
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,820
do it?

853
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,980
Please wait a moment.

854
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,100
Dashun, someone's here
to have a formula prepared.

855
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,740
One of the ingredients

856
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,740
requires Yunnan Shexiang.

857
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,900
Do we have it here?

858
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,140
Yunnan Shexiang is too expensive.

859
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,860
Twenty silver dollars per qian.
Father didn't stock it.

860
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,260
We only have Sichuan Shexiang.

861
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,220
Ask him if Sichuan Shexiang
is acceptable.

862
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
If not,

863
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,900
then ask him to try another apothecary.

864
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:55,900
Okay.

865
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,300
Sir, how should I address you?

866
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,660
My surname is Zhang.

867
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,140
Mr. Zhang, please have a seat.

868
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,860
Mr. Zhang,

869
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,780
for your medicine,
must it be Yunnan Shexiang?

870
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,380
Would Sichuan Shexiang work instead?

871
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
The physician said

872
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,140
Yunnan Shexiang is best.

873
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,460
Alright, no problem.

874
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,860
We can prepare this formula here.

875
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,940
However,

876
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,620
you'll have to wait a little longer.

877
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,620
Would you care to wait here

878
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
and enjoy a cup of tea,

879
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,740
or shall we send the prepared medicine

880
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,100
to your residence

881
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,500
once it's ready?

882
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,100
That would be great.

883
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,980
Then I'll leave you an address.

884
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,460
Alright.

885
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,700
Shitou,

886
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,700
give him the brush and ink.

887
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,220
Okay.

888
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,620
By the way,

889
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,540
how much will your medicine cost?

890
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,700
Right now,

891
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,300
Yunnan Shexiang goes
for 20 silver dollars a qian.

892
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,660
We're out of stock at the moment,

893
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,860
and since we'll have to make you wait,

894
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,220
we'll give it to you
for 18 silver dollars a qian.

895
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,260
That's wonderful.

896
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,820
I'll leave you the address right away.

897
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,860
Here you go.

898
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,980
Okay.

899
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,700
Mr. Zhang, rest assured,

900
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,540
it will be delivered within two hours.

901
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,180
Then I'll wait at home.

902
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,580
Okay.

903
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,220
Farewell.

904
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,060
Please take care.

905
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,500
Shitou,

906
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,020
which apothecaries nearby

907
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,660
sell Yunnan Shexiang?

908
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,740
You'll have to ask Young Master
about that.

909
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,300
Go ask him.

910
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:30,780
Okay.

911
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,580
Shaohua,

912
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,980
are you serious?

913
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,700
We're paying 20 for Yunnan Shexiang

914
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,300
and selling it for 18?

915
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,620
I am serious.

916
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,980
We can't be losing money

917
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,060
to put a prescription together.

918
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,220
Because I want to make more money.

919
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,980
What do you mean?

920
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,380
My grandfather once told me something:

921
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,220
As long as a customer
walks through the door,

922
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
you can't turn them away.

923
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,100
But we don't have that ingredient.

924
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,620
So we have to get it
from another apothecary.

925
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,780
Sourcing it from another apothecary
is fine.

926
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,300
But you can't
mark the price down like that.

927
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,940
We can choose not to make a profit

928
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,180
and sell it to the customer at cost,

929
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,780
but we can't afford
to take a loss ourselves.

930
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,300
Dashun, calm down.

931
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,780
I'll explain this to you.

932
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,500
I'm not rushing.

933
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,140
I just think you're losing money
with that markdown.

934
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,540
Sit down.

935
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,100
My grandfather also told me

936
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,620
that an ordinary apothecary

937
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,980
can only do business within three li.

938
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,940
But a truly powerful apothecary

939
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,980
can extend its reach far and wide

940
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,380
across vast distances.

941
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,700
And if we want to grow the business,

942
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,340
first,

943
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,780
we need exclusive remedies
that no other apothecary offers.

944
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,900
Second,

945
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,060
we need services that set us apart.

946
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,100
Right now,

947
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,380
we don't have our own unique formulas,

948
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,780
so our only option
is to focus on our service.

949
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,220
But doing business at a loss,

950
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,660
what kind of service is that?

951
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,780
It's true. For this order,

952
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,100
we did lose two silver dollars.

953
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,220
But it gave that customer the impression

954
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,060
that we can prepare prescriptions

955
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,020
that others can't

956
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
and at a lower price.

957
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,900
I believe he'll come back next time

958
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,140
and likely become a regular.

959
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,060
Perhaps he can even promote
our apothecary.

960
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,180
This is something 20 silver dollars
can't buy.

961
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,460
Now that you put it that way,

962
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,180
it does make some sense.

963
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,740
Also, that customer

964
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,100
was well-dressed.

965
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,300
Look at his address,

966
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,740
Nanluoguxiang.

967
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,700
Even though I haven't been
in Peking for long,

968
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,860
I know

969
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,780
people who live there
are either rich or powerful.

970
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,820
If this chance

971
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,180
opens new doors for us,

972
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,300
Dashun,

973
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,660
even 200 silver dollars cannot buy that.

974
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,980
Did your grandfather
teach you all of this too?

975
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,700
These are things I thought of myself.

976
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,660
How are you so amazing?

977
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,500
Because I'm me.
