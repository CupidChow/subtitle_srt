00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,700
and make sure he couldn't talk to him.

I promise

383
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,260
I only walked away for like one minute.

384
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,340
They started talking in just one minute?

385
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,540
Bend over the table, hands down,
and stick your butt out.

386
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,620
Mr. Tian, I was wrong.

387

Stick it out higher!

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,860
It was my fault!

One minute, you say?

390
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
One minute, huh?

391
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180

395
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,700

Didn't you leave?

Wait, let me think.

402
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
It wasn't

403
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,020
an English song.

Mr. Tian!

409
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,300
You ruined my big plan!

410

No.

- Don't.

I rushed right over.

To be honest, Mr. Yang,

495
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,980
I asked you
to come all the way to Shanghai

to help me identify someone.

I hear he used to be in Northeast China

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,060
and that he loves to drink baijiu.

Yeah, that's Glebov.

a lot of Chinese customers.

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,860
I know he is Glebov,

566
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,060
a White Russian military doctor.

567
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,660
How did you find out?

568
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
Take a seat, please.

569
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,300
As long as you're willing to testify,

570
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,340
you and your family
will be well taken care of.

571
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,380
Mr. Tian.

572
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,540
They fell for it.

573
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,140
Here they come.

574
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,420
Is that Mr. Tian?

575
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,260
Mr. Tian.

576
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,980
Is that Mr. Tian?

577
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,540
Yes.

578
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,020
Mr. Tian,

579
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,660
are you confident
about winning this lawsuit?

580
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,620
Mr. Tian, we heard you declared that...

581
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,900
Sorry, everyone.

582
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,380
Mr. Tian, would you like
to say a few words?

583
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,940
Mr. Tian is not accepting
any interviews at the moment.

584
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,020
Everyone, please come this way.

585
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,060
Okay.

586
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,780
You brought all these people?

587
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,740
I guess so.

588
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,940
Too few.

589
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,140
Bring more people.

590
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
Don't hold back on the spending.

591
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
Make a bigger splash.

592
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:24,940
- Alright.
- Mr. Tian.

593
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,620
Couldn't find Professor Claudy anywhere.

594
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,180
Where did you look?

595
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,220
We checked all the hotels,

596
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,100
but he wasn't there.

597
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,380
Keep searching.
Every corner, every shadow,

598
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,140
even the filthiest places if you must.

599
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,620
Go find him!

600
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,220
Okay.

601
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,860
Tongdao,

602
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,260
the trial is about to begin.

603
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,780
If Professor Claudy doesn't show up,

604
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,020
how are we going to fight this lawsuit?

605
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,340
We have the power of attorney
and our lawyer here.

606
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,220
We're ready to proceed.

607
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,420
Mr. Tian.

608
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,740
Why isn't Wen Zhiqiu here?

609
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,900
He had something else to take care of

610
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
and couldn't make it.

611
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,220
If I were him, I wouldn't come either.

612
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,580
So embarrassing.

613
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,380
Mr. Tian.

614
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,620
We'll see who's truly embarrassed
when the trial is over.

615
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Yes.

616
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,500
Once the trial's over,

617
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,100
you'll be flat broke.

618
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,860
Why are you talking nonsense

619
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,220
in the middle of the day?

620
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,020
As pigheaded as ever.

621
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,580
Shaohua.

622
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,100
My journalist friends have all arrived.

623
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,340
Do you want to do the interview now,

624
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,820
or wait until the trial's over?

625
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,580
Let's wait until the trial is over.

626
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,420
Your Honor.

627
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,940
Professor Claudy

628
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,180
is unable to appear in court today,

629
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,820
[Plaintiff]
but he has authorized me

630
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,820
to submit the following evidence
on his behalf.

631
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,580
This is the formal agreement

632
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,420
showing Professor Claudy's transfer of the brain supplement

633
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,100
[Defendant]
to Tian's Apothecary,

634
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,060
[Presiding Judge]
along with his signed authorization

635
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,380
for them to use his portrait rights.

636
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,900
And this is Professor Claudy's

637
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,020
personally handwritten protest letter,

638
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
strongly demanding

639
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,820
severe punishment
for Wen's Pharmacy's infringement.

640
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,940
Defendant,

641
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,660
regarding the documents
submitted by the plaintiff,

642
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,540
do you wish to respond?

643
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,340
Yes.

644
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,700
Your Honor,

645
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,500
we have no objection

646
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,300
to the plaintiff's

647
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,740
written evidence.

648
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,460
However, we have serious concerns

649
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,700
about the foundation

650
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,580
of the plaintiff's evidence.

651
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,820
Proceed.

652
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,740
Your Honor.

653
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,060
Is Professor Cloudy

654
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,100
really who they claim to be?

655
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,620
What kind of question is that?

656
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,820
Your

657
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,380
Honors.

658
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,620
I'll rephrase the question.

659
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500
Is his name

660
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,460
really Claudy?

661
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,580
Is he really an American professor?

662
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,380
Did he really invent

663
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,420
any so-called brain supplement?

664
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,660
Order.

665
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,820
Defendant,

666
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,260
do you have evidence
for your previous questions?

667
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,500
Your Honor, yes.

668
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,340
We request to call Huang Deming
as a witness

669
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,140
to testify in court.

670
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,620
Objection.

671
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,380
Your Honor.

672
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,540
Huang Deming's testimony

673
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,540
could be the key to proving

674
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,140
who Professor Claudy really is.

675
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,220
Summon
the witness Huang Deming to court.

676
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,060
[Witness]

677
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,140
Mr. Huang.

678
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,660
Mr. Huang.

679
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,580
Please introduce yourself to the court.

680
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,900
Your Honor.

681
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,260
My name is Huang Deming.

682
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,460
For the past year,

683
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,020
I have been
Professor Claudy's assistant.

684
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,420
Your Honor.

685
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,260
Mr. Huang has been

686
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,420
Professor Claudy's assistant

687
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,380
for a whole year.

688
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,460
Presumably, you are very familiar

689
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,900
with him.

690
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,140
You could say

691
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,420
that, in this world,

692
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,540
aside from Professor Claudy himself,

693
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
I probably know him better than anyone.

694
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,660
Now,

695
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,860
please state for the court:

696
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,420
who is Professor Claudy?

697
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,220
Tell us his real name and identity.

698
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,420
Your Honor.

699
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,900
Professor Claudy's real name

700
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
is Claudy Speeter,

701
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,420
a professor
at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy

702
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,040
and an honorary president

703
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,980
of the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America.

704
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,540
No.

705
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,580
Mr. Huang.

706
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I meant,

707
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,180
please truthfully introduce to the court

708
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,380
Professor Claudy's real name

709
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,540
and identity.

710
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,380
Your Honor.

711
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,060
I once studied
at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.

712
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,260
Here's my diploma.

713
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,460
This is my graduation photo.

714
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,580
I hereby affirm

715
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,540
that Professor Claudy
is a true American citizen

716
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,460
and a highly respected scientist

717
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,020
of great distinction.

718
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,260
He himself holds multiple inventions,

719
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,860
the most important of which

720
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,780
is the brain supplement.

721
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,020
Let me remind you, Huang Deming.

722
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,620
This is a court of law.

723
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,140
Any attempt to deceive it
is a serious offense.

724
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,340
I understand, Mr. Lin.

725
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,860
Deceiving the court
is certainly a serious crime.

726
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,620
That's why I cannot

727
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,020
and will not lie.

728
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,860
Your Honor.

729
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,700
Every word I say is the truth.

730
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,180
What's going on?

731
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,900
Why is the defendant's witness

732
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,860
speaking for the plaintiff?

733
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,660
Order.

734
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,860
Plaintiff's lawyer,

735
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,140
do you have any more questions?

736
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,620
Your Honor.

737
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,820
The defendant's witness
has made it very clear.

738
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,540
We have no more questions.

739
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,780
Then, let's conclude for today.

740
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,340
Court adjourned.

741
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,020
[Fairness. Justice.]

742
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,540
Mr. Tian.

743
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,380
Please predict the final verdict.

744
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:04,980
[Shanghai Public Court]
They're coming out.

745
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,500
Isn't this obvious?

746
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,980
Although the final judgment
has not been announced yet,

747
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,060
the outcome can be clearly predicted.

748
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,540
We will surely win.

749
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,220
They are thieves!

750
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,780
They are coming out!

751
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,700
Don't rush, everyone!

752
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,980
Let's go one by one, okay?

753
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,100
Guess that shut you up.

754
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,140
Mr. Tian, you are indeed impressive.

755
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,020
You built up

756
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,780
Professor Claudy's reputation
all by yourself, huh?

757
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I'll tear you down the same way,

758
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,180
and you won't get back up.

759
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,260
Dear members of the press,

760
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,980
Wen's Pharmacy and Professor Claudy

761
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,900
are about to hold
a joint press conference.

762
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,660
We will provide direct updates

763
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,500
on today's legal proceedings

764
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,620
and the Oriental Bunao Pill case.

765
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,020
The event will take place
at Xinhui Hotel, Zhejiang Road.

766
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,380
Feel free to join us there.

767
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,500
Sure, let's go check it out.

768
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,580
- Right.
- Let's go check it out.

769
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,380
There's definitely big news.

770
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,940
Yes, absolutely.

771
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,220
How did they get together

772
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,940
with Professor Claudy?

773
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,380
I don't know.

774
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,940
Bingxin.

775
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,900
Tongxin.

776
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,300
You came to observe too?

777
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,940
Tongxin, get in the car.

778
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,620
Don't get distracted by a woman.

779
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,580
Tongdao, this is Bingxin.

780
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,580
I know.

781
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,500
I'm talking about her.

782
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,860
[Professor Claudy & Wen's Pharmacy]
Wen's Pharmacy and me

783
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,100
[Press Conference]
definitely reached an understanding.

784
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,460
Professor Claudy

785
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,500
has already reached
a mutual understanding

786
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
with Wen's Pharmacy.

787
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,460
I decide not to appeal again.

788
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,940
And he has also decided
not to appeal again.

789
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,420
As you all know,

790
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,540
I'm the professor
of Philadelphia College of Pharmacy,

791
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,350
and the honorary president

792
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,900
of Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America.

793
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,780
As everyone knows,

794
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,220
He is

795
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,180
a professor
at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy.

796
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,910
and the president

797
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,100
of Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers.

798
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,980
But actually, the efficacy
of a new medicine

799
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,540
is more important
than the identity of its inventor.

800
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,180
The professor also believes

801
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,260
that who invented
this medicine is not important.

802
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,500
What's important
is the efficacy of this medicine.

803
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,180
That's why

804
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,740
I want everybody to pay attention

805
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,220
to the new drug Oriental Bunao Pill.

806
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,580
The professor also hopes

807
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,860
that everyone can shift

808
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,300
their focus

809
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,660
to the Oriental Bunao Pill.

810
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,780
I've tried it myself.

811
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,380
The efficacy of this drug

812
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,020
is significant.

813
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,860
He personally verified

814
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,580
that the efficacy of this medicine
is excellent.

815
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
It's a good medicine.

816
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,540
Thank you.

817
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,580
Thank you very much.

818
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,740
You said they fell for it.

819
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,820
Did they take the bait or did I?

820
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,340
Mr. Tian, I don't know.

821
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,420
You idiot!

822
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,140
You can't even see this?

823
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
I took the bait!

824
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,060
Me, you know?

825
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,020
I worked so hard
to promote Professor Claudy,

826
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,500
and then he just turned around
and spoke for them.

827
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,100
Am I that stupid?

828
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,700
No.

829
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,980
Am I that foolish?

830
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,780
Am I the kind who does
all the work for others' benefit?

831
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,220
I can't believe it!

832
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,260
Alright, Tongdao.

833
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,700
Don't get too worked up.

834
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:13,980
How about this?

835
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,540
I'll go to that newspaper office

836
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,900
and expose that White Russian refugee.

837
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,820
Tongxin,

838
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,580
are you really that stupid?

839
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,580
If you expose him,

840
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,220
what happens to our medicine

841
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
and our reputation?

842
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,220
That's right.

843
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,980
So what do we do, Tongdao?

844
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,700
Why are you asking me?

845
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,380
I've got no clue!

846
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,500
You messed up with a small-time star,

847
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,780
and got played.

848
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,420
And I'm not even allowed
to call you out?

849
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,420
Tongdao, what's that supposed to mean?

850
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,340
Are you saying I got played by her?

851
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,660
Tongxin,

852
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,820
can I ask you a favor?

853
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,700
Stop hanging around with women.

854
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,100
You've totally lost your edge!

855
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,020
You think you're second-in-command
at Tian's Apothecary?

856
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,460
You're the top idiot!

857
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,660
No. You're too dumb
to even be the dumbest.

858
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,020
Then who outranks me, Tongdao?

859
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,780
I...

860
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,100
[Shanghai North]

861
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,220
If it weren't for you all,

862
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,300
I might never have seen

863
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,420
Natasha in this lifetime.

864
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,020
Thank you.

865
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,500
Thanks

866
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,180
for playing along.

867
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,540
I've been putting on a show
since I hit Shanghai.

868
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,420
This little bit of drama is nothing.

869
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,940
Glebov,

870
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,460
we should get on the train.

871
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,060
I'm going to see my Natasha.

872
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,260
Hope you and your daughter
can reunite soon.

873
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,860
Thank you, Miss Chu.

874
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,260
And I wish you and Mr. Wen
a prosperous business.

875
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,740
I hope to have the opportunity
to meet you again.

876
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,100
Farewell.

877
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,140
Farewell.

878
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,020
Have a safe journey,

879
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,820
Mr. Yang.

880
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,660
Please.

881
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,180
I'm off.

882
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,980
Alright.

883
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,660
Come back soon.

884
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,460
You understand Russian?

885
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,100
I don't.

886
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
But nodding usually does the trick.

887
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,900
I was key

888
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,300
to beating Mr. Tian this time.

889
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,060
Here to take credit, are we?

890
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,820
I also want a reward.

891
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,100
Mr. Wen, how do you plan to reward me?

892
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,020
I'll treat you to a meal.

893
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,860
You really think one meal
covers everything I did?

894
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,260
I'll also give you some bonus money.

895
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,060
How much?

896
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,540
One hundred silver dollars.

897
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,900
Isn't that too little?

898
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,100
Then how much do you want?

899
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,420
I want a promotion.

900
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,740
I don't want to be just another manager.

901
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,020
I want to be Deputy General Manager.

902
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,940
Deputy General Manager?

903
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,140
You've only just started here.

904
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,860
I also want to convert
my one-tenth labor stock

905
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,860
into capital stock.

906
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,620
We can talk about the promotion,

907
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,420
but the capital stock...

908
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,140
Given my abilities,

909
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,580
I'm more than qualified
to be the Deputy General Manager.

910
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,300
And considering what I've done
for Wen's Pharmacy,

911
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,100
I've earned
a tenth of the capital stock.

912
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,540
Alright, how about this?

913
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,700
I'll get you promoted
and give you a raise.

914
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,660
We'll come back

915
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,020
to the capital stock later.

916
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,220
Then Mr. Wen, I think I'll resign.

917
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,420
After the whole Mr. Tian situation,

918
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,060
I wouldn't be surprised

919
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,620
if pharmacies all over Shanghai

920
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,940
are lining up to hire me.

921
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,420
Are you threatening me?

922
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,140
Yes, I am.

923
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,660
Alright then.

924
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,540
If you want to convert
your labor stock into capital stock,

925
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,180
then I cannot give you a raise.

926
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,140
Also,

927
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,900
if you want to do the work
of a Deputy General Manager,

928
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,580
you can only get paid
like an ordinary manager.

929
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,620
Can you do that?

930
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,020
Deal.

931
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,660
And you have to treat me to dinner.

932
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,860
Just one meal.

933
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,500
I'll choose the restaurant.

934
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,460
I'll order the dishes.

935
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,580
You pay for the wine.

936
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,580
The tip is on you.

937
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,060
You calculating woman.

938
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,980
What's that?

939
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,460
It means very calculating.

940
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,820
You're saying I'm a calculating woman?

941
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,860
Aren't you?

942
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,660
The feeling is mutual, Mr. Wen.

943
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,940
You're home?
Why didn't you turn on the light?

944
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,780
What's wrong?

945
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,180
I just realized

946
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,260
that the Tian family never accepted me.

947
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,940
They just wanted to use me

948
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,700
against you.

949
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,780
Inviting me to their table,

950
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,060
asking me for afternoon tea,

951
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,620
and letting me overhear
Huang Deming getting fired.

952
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,860
It was all set up.

953
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,460
Yes.

954
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,020
Mr. Tian anticipated

955
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
that you would tip me off.

956
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,860
So he set a trap

957
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,020
for both of us.

958
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,620
Thankfully,

959
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,500
you didn't fall for it.

960
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,180
Otherwise,

961
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,740
I'd never be able to live with myself.

962
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,300
How did you know it was a trap?

963
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,100
Remember this?

964
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Back when I just joined Wen's Pharmacy,

965
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,100
you introduced me to Tian's Apothecary
to discuss a partnership.

966
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,140
I remember.

967
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,060
When you came back,

968
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,420
you just said it didn't work out.

969
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,180
It wasn't just a fallout.

970
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,700
Mr. Tian totally humiliated me.

971
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,900
Oh my goodness.

972
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,020
From the way he treated me,

973
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,620
I could tell

974
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,140
they had

975
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,180
serious issues with you.

976
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,660
But at that time,

977
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,380
you and Mr. Tian were deeply in love,

978
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,180
and I didn't want to spoil your mood,

979
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,260
so I didn't tell you.

980
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm sorry, Shaohua.

981
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,860
Later,

982
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,460
Tian Tongdao sued Wen's Pharmacy.

983
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,660
And at this critical moment,

984
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
they suddenly accepted you.

985
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,660
This completely contradicts

986
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,540
his harsh and snobbish style.

987
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,620
It made me suspect

988
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,540
their intention in accepting you.

989
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,220
And then later,

990
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,100
at the most critical point
of the lawsuit,

991
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,140
they allowed you,
who were visiting for the first time,

992
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,860
to overhear such private conversations.

993
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,580
That made me even more suspicious.

994
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,700
Didn't your friend say

995
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,780
Mr. Tian fired Claudy's assistant?

996
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,220
Maybe we can get him on our side.

997
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,460
That could work.

998
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,820
It might not be a way out

999
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,140
but a trap.

1000
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,100
Why?

1001
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,460
Intuition.

1002
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,060
Does that count?

1003
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,100
Well, I trust Miss Chu's judgment.

1004
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,100
I'm so foolish.

1005
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,300
You're not foolish.

1006
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,140
You just get flustered when you care.

1007
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,060
And you wanted to marry
Mr. Tian so much,

1008
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,980
yet when we were at odds with them,

1009
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,340
you were still willing to help me.

1010
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,220
The info may have been wrong,

1011
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,580
but your sincerity was never in doubt.

1012
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,340
So Erniu, I should thank you.

1013
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,580
I might've done more harm than good.

1014
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,700
Not at all.

1015
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,700
Your concern made a real difference.

1016
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,940
The moment we realized
Mr. Tian was using you

1017
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,180
to bait us,

1018
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,420
we devised a way to turn the tables.

1019
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,860
I was thinking

1020
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,180
if Mr. Tian fired Huang Deming

1021
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,260
to put on a show for us,

1022
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,340
then what was the purpose of that?

1023
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,100
He must have also believed

1024
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,340
that we had already started
to doubt Professor Claudy.

1025
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,260
So he would not let us

1026
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,420
expose his identity in court.

1027
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,100
Then pushing Huang Deming to us

1028
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,140
must be to cause destruction

1029
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,700
under the guise of defecting.

1030
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,100
That makes some sense.

1031
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,700
No matter what they do,

1032
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,980
just ignore them.

1033
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,620
Just have Mr. Yang find
a few more people to testify in court.

1034
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,580
The presiding judge will believe us.

1035
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,780
Let's go talk to Huang.

1036
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,340
With enough money on the table,

1037
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,900
he'll come around.

1038
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,140
Why not go against the grain?

1039
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,300
Glebov

1040
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,700
looks like a scholar,

1041
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,060
and he speaks English very well.

1042
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
He also knows some medicine.

1043
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,660
That's why Mr. Tian chose him

1044
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,500
and had him impersonate
an American professor.

1045
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,780
Over the past two years,

1046
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
he's poured a lot of money

1047
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,940
into boosting Claudy's reputation.

1048
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,860
So why must we expose him

1049
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,140
at this moment?

1050
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,300
We could make use of that.

1051
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,140
Exposing him is to win the lawsuit.

1052
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,780
The lawsuit isn't the goal.

1053
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,180
The market is.

1054
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,580
If we can make use of it,

1055
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,740
wouldn't that mean we win both?

1056
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,740
Exactly.
Instead of bribing Huang Deming,

1057
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,300
why not bribe Glebov?

1058
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,580
How much would that cost?

1059
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,300
I don't think we'll have to pay at all.

1060
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,180
Glebov has a daughter

1061
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,140
named Natasha,

1062
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,020
whom he holds very dear.

1063
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,860
That's why he closed his clinic

1064
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,780
and traveled all the way to Shanghai

1065
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,900
to find her.
