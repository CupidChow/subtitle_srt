00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,660
on rare occasions.

191
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,580
Any chance we can make it more regular?

192
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,820
No.

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,020
Why?

194
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,460
I'm afraid
it might harm your reputation.

195
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,500
Now I don't even care about my life,

196
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
so reputation? Please.

197
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
Dying's no big deal,

198
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,980
but losing face is catastrophic.

199
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,300
So now you understand that.

200
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm being serious.

201
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,460
We need to talk
about something important.

202
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,180
Among the members of the TCM Guild,

203
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,820
Mr. Tian still holds

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,540
the highest approval rating,

205
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,300
at 30%,

206
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,940
while Mr. Xia trails behind
with just 20% support.

207
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,180
What about the other 50%?

208
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,740
Wen's Pharmacy.

209
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,620
Mr. Xia.

210
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,580
I'll discuss this with Shaohua.

211
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,860
Understood.

212
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,340
Okay, I'll get back to you later.

213
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,660
Mr. Xia came to us for help.

214
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,860
Help with what?

215
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,020
He said that three months ago,

216
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,580
through Mr. Lu's connections,

217
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,980
he managed to get
a batch of anti-epidemic powder

218
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,620
added to the procurement list
of the Zhejiang-Shanghai Allied Forces.

219
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,300
But less than a month later,

220
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,980
the allied forces were defeated.

221
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,700
Now there's no way to sell that batch.

222
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,580
So he's asking us for help.

223
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,100
How big is the batch?

224
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,860
Half a million boxes.

225
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,620
If we help him distribute them,

226
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,300
we can sell 300 boxes a month at most.

227
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,700
Even with all the branches
of Jujing Apothecary,

228
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,620
selling 500,000 boxes

229
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,060
would take 20 years.

230
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,460
But if over 300 pharmacies in Shanghai

231
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,700
joined in,

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,100
they could clear the whole batch
in just six months.

233
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,780
The only reason they'd help

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,100
is if there's a significant profit

235
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
to be made.

236
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,700
The only option now
is to offload it at a loss.

237
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,380
Okay then, help me figure out

238
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,460
what kind of loss we're looking at.

239
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,580
Since it's a loss anyway,

240
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,020
make it a complete one.

241
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,700
[Jujing Apothecary]
Give them away for free?

242
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,620
Yes.

243
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,820
There are 500,000 blue-collar workers
in Shanghai.

244
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
One box per person would be perfect.

245
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,180
Do you have any idea

246
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,180
what 500,000 boxes
of anti-epidemic powder

247
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,140
are worth?

248
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,700
A hundred thousand silver dollars,

249
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
but your cost is only 30,000.

250
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,860
"Only"?

251
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
That's a pretty bold claim.

252
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,140
Or there's another way.

253
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,260
Based on our numbers,

254
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,900
if we bring the ex-factory price

255
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
down to five wen,

256
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,100
and set the retail price at forty,

257
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,020
more than 300 pharmacies across Shanghai

258
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,700
would be willing to help distribute it.

259
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,180
Customers will be willing to buy,

260
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,780
and we can sell out

261
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,500
within two months.

262
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,300
Wouldn't that mean a loss?

263
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,860
Twenty-eight thousand silver dollars.

264
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
That's a steep hit, don't you think?

265
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,580
No.

266
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,660
Absolutely not.

267
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,140
We have no choice.

268
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,420
I think

269
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,260
we should ship all this
to the north of China.

270
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,020
With so many customers
for Shouyuan Apothecary,

271
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,180
selling them shouldn't be a problem.

272
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,740
This batch of anti-epidemic powder

273
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,620
was tailored for Zhejiang.

274
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,940
If we send it up north,

275
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,300
it won't be nearly as effective.

276
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,540
That could damage our reputation.

277
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,220
Maybe we should put it on hold

278
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,220
for now.

279
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,620
Let's talk about the TCM Guild election.

280
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,140
Right now,

281
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,900
half the guild

282
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,220
thinks you're just a northerner

283
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,900
who came to Shanghai
to make a quick buck.

284
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,460
They say you are mercenary

285
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,620
and cold-hearted.

286
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,140
So if we want to change their minds

287
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,300
and turn things around

288
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,540
in a short time,

289
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,500
we'll need to put in real work

290
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,380
to reshape your public image.

291
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,820
I've done a rough estimate of the costs

292
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,540
for reporter interviews,

293
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,500
newspaper and magazine ads,

294
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,260
plus fliers and posters.

295
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,940
Also...

296
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,460
Also, you need to spend more time

297
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,100
connecting with other members
of the TCM Guild.

298
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,340
Altogether, these expenses will come to

299
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,980
around 32,000 silver dollars.

300
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,580
This is just the bare minimum.

301
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,620
Yes.

302
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,060
That much?

303
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,700
We're already spending a fortune
on this.

304
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,180
Selling at a loss isn't an option,

305
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
and giving it away? No chance.

Then why are we still struggling?

331
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,020
Because we're fated to suffer.

332
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,820
No, poverty isn't fate.

333
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,300
It's because there are classes
and exploitation.

334
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,380
Why do capitalists exploit?

335
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,740
Because they hold power.

00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,940
Yes.

376
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,420
But there are too many workers.

377
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,780
Miss Chu doesn't know where to start.

378
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,060
Going through the Municipal Council
won't work.

379
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,620
Factories aren't safe either.

380
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,420
The foremen will skim off the top.

381
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,260
Leave it to us.

382
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,900
We've got the Workers' Club,

383
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,860
League of Comrades,
and Workers' Mutual Aid Society.

384
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,340
All are run by workers

385
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,860
and they reach every factory,

386
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,020
dock, and station in Shanghai.

387
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,540
We'll make sure every pack of medicine

388
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,780
goes straight to the workers.

389
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,140
Thank you.

390
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,780
Actually, we owe you the thanks.

391
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
I heard

392
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,180
you've been supporting female workers

393
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,780
with free checkups and medicine
these past few years.

394
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,180
Shaohua

395
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,900
used to work here.

396
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,700
She even led us in a strike.

397
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,380
But back then,

398
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,140
she went by a different name.

399
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,660
Is that so?

400
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,180
Mr. Xia,

401
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,540
when the workers

402
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,140
distribute the anti-epidemic powder,

403
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,180
could they also hand out business cards

404
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,740
for Jujing Apothecary
and Wen's Pharmacy?

405
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,100
No problem.

406
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,460
Additionally,

407
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,660
I suggest printing a line

408
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,620
on the packaging,

409
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,380
encouraging workers to unite

410
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,500
and fight for equal treatment.

411
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,420
Okay.

412
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,660
Excuse me,

413
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,540
Mr. Xia,

414
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,860
I'm from Domestic
and Foreign Cotton Mill No. 8.

415
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
We'd love to have you speak
at our place tomorrow night.

416
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,500
No problem.

417
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,580
Mr. Xia,

418
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,380
we are from the Printers' Union.

419
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,100
Are you available

420
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,820
to give us a talk on Wednesday?

421
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,180
I'll be doing research
at Zhabei Dock during the day,

422
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,180
but I'm free in the evening.

423
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,660
Okay, see you then.

424
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,500
Okay.

425
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,420
Mr. Xia,

426
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,500
I represent the seamen from CMSNC.

427
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,980
We also want to join
the Shanghai General Labor Union.

428
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,020
We'd love to.

429
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,780
- Okay.
- Mr. Xia.

430
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,380
Some workers are waiting
for you at the gate.

431

For what's next,

432
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,140
just check in with Yin Amei.

433
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,140
Excuse me.

434
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,060
Okay, see you.

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,260
- Shaohua.
- Shaohua.

436
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,180
Let's go get some water over there.

437
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,300
- Okay.
- Let's go.

441
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,860
I know.

442
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,340
Isn't that money due next week?

443
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,260
It's only Wednesday today.

444
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,140
Alright.

445
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,100
I understand.

446
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,980
Okay.

447
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,780
That's it.

450
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,180
Mr. Wen,

451
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,380
Ms. Chu went out.

452
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,420
Um,

453
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,100
have the accounts
from Songjiang been prepared?

454
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:57,860
Yes.

455
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,620
Give them to me.

456
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,020
They've all been compiled
and given to Ms. Chu.

457
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,900
Where is she?

458
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,060
Sun took leave,

459
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,700
so Ms. Chu took over the delivery
of anti-epidemic powder.

460
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,180
Where'd she go?

461
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,380
Zhabei Cargo Dock.

462
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,180
Okay.

463
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,900
Thank you.

464
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,860
Please wait a moment.

465
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,900
Okay.

466
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,220
Hello, sir.

467
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,300
May I ask where Mr. Pang is?

468
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,300
Over by the wooden house.

469
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Okay, thank you.

470
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,460
Much obliged, thanks.

471
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,900
If this pie

472
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,060
represents the handling fees
paid by the cargo owners,

473
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,020
look,

474
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,100
the dock capitalists took a big chunk,

475
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,220
the compradors grabbed their share,

476
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,660
and the foremen still took a slice.

477
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,020
Workers are left
with just this tiny bit.

478
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,220
We did all the work,

479
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,180
but they walked away
with most of the money.

480
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,580
That's exploitation!

481
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,820
If we don't want this to keep happening,

482
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,780
we've got to stand together
and build a union,

483
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,780
so we can get organized
and start a revolution.

484
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,020
Get back to work!

485
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,340

488
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,060
Mr. Pang, the number you reported

489

490
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,100

492
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,980
exactly 416 boxes
of anti-epidemic powder right here.

493
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,180
Check them.

00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500

Why are you here?

498
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,940
Mr. Zheng from Songjiang says
he's got a family emergency

499
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,620
and needs some money.

500
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,060
He wants to settle
next month's accounts ahead of time.

501
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,700
Since you've got the ledger,
I came to find you.

to collect some documents.

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,540
So sure?

933
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,060
Let me put it this way.

934
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,980
He and I

935
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,380
may go years without seeing each other,

936
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,260
or even without knowing
if the other is still alive.

937
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,740
But when we meet again,

938
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,220
it'll be just like before.

939
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,900
Got somewhere to be?

940
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,740
Or is it boring to talk about me?

941
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,580
It's not boring,

942
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,900
just a little cheesy.

943
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,220
Since we sat down,

944
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,860
you've checked your watch three times.

945
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,780
You're clearly up to something.

946
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Is it a date?

947
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,660
Who is it?

948
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,980
Is it a girl?

949
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,020
Is she pretty?

950
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,140
Prettier than you.

951
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
How long have you known each other?

952
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,020
Not long.

953
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,580
You keep dodging the topic.

954
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,380
Are you into her?

955
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,580
So you get to be head over heels,
but I can't fall for someone?

956
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,100
No, I'm happy for you.

957
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,020
It's about time.

958
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,820
I'm leaving.

959
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,300
Alright, go ahead.

960
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Hope it all works out between you two.

961
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,740
Hope you meet up again soon.

962
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:20,620
Okay.

963
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,980
He's got a date,
but still asked me to dinner...

964
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,380
ordered half the menu...

965
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,940
and I'm the one paying?

966
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:43,100
[Borgna Café]

967
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,620
