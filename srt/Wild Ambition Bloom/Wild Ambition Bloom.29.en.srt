[Episode 29]

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,140
Twenty dan? That can't be right.

32
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,340
Security Command insisted it's 20 dan.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,500
Everyone on site can vouch for it.

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,740
There were only two dan.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,180
They must've fudged the numbers.

36
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,780
Mr. Jin claims we're the ones to blame.

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,900
Why?

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,340
How would I know?

39
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,100
Is it that Mr. Jin

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,780
doesn't dare cross Security Command?

41
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,140
Or maybe

42
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,020
he knows we've been padding
the numbers these past two years?

What now?

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,340
How would I know?

47
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,260
It's all your fault.

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,700
If it weren't for your lousy intel,

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,180
I wouldn't have caused such a big mess.

50
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,820
Didn't you say those Suzhou companies

51
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,020
had no one powerful backing them?

52
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,860
True. But turns out they've got

53
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,860
flipping Security Command behind them!

54
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,300
Mr. Mu, please calm down.

55
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,260
Now Mr. Jin wants me to return

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,540
twenty dan of opium.

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,700
Where the heck am I supposed to find it?

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,180
Mr. Mu,

59
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,860
don't you find this a little suspicious?

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,980
Security Command confiscated the opium,

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,460
yet somehow it ended up
with an unrelated Suzhou trading firm

62
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,700
tasked with transporting it.

63
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,140
They went so far as to disguise it
as medicinal herbs,

64
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,740
and store it away
in some quiet little warehouse.

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,900
I think

66
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,420
there's definitely something shady

67
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,260
going on with this shipment.

68
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,260
There were indeed rumors

69
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,060
that the military had been
secretly smuggling opium as well.

70
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,020
Right.

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,180
If we can get our hands

72
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,580
on proof of their opium smuggling,

73
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,260
we won't have to pay
for those twenty dan at all.

74
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,460
They'll have to agree

75
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,060

76
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,820

When the time is right,

79
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,220
we'll need to leverage public opinion.

The Ministry of Finance?

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,980
News Daily was brave enough
to report it.

91
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,380
Okay.

92
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,060
They even mentioned
Xiong Shihui by name.

93
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,180
I'll check on that for you in a moment.

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,700
So, what's the interview mainly about?

95
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,140
Dajin News must've been bought out

by Xiong Shihui.

97
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,860
They're calling us a trafficking ring?

98
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,820
How dare they.

99
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,020
Mr. Mu,

100
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,100
a reporter from Zhaohui News
wants to interview you.

101
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,820
Alright.

102
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,540
Jishi News wants one too, right?

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Then schedule them together.

104
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
I'll talk to them

105
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,460
about how opium prohibition
is going in Shanghai.

106
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,940
Okay.

107
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,220
Mr. Jin.

108
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,180
Master.

109
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,020
Shut your mouth.

110
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,660
I wouldn't dare be your master.

111
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,500
What happened, Master?

112
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,260
I've been smoothing things over for you.

113
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,340
Why did you leak the warehouse

114
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
to the press?

115
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,340
Master, it wasn't me.

116
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,660
The reporters found out themselves.

117
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,420
Nonsense.

118
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,100
I heard you're giving an interview
to the press.

119
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:29,940
I...

120
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,700
Listen up.

121
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,180
If reporters bring this up again,

122
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
your only response

123
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
is "No comment."

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,620
Anyone who talks to the press

125
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,300
or leaks any information

126
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,100
will face immediate consequences!

127
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,140
Master,

128
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,940
public opinion is in our favor.

129
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,620
The Shanghai citizens are demanding
Xiong Shihui's removal!

130
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,500
Favorable, my foot.

131
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,620
You think you're messing
with Security Command?

132
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,260
If not them,

133
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:02,980
then who?

134
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,620
It's the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing.

135
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
You flipping idiot!

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,700
I can't cover for you this time.

137
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,660
Tomorrow, return those 20 dan of opium.

138
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,820
What happens after that

139
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,980
is up to your fate.

140
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,540
Bingxin.

141
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,060
Quick, open the door.

142
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,420
Mu?

143
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,420
Hurry.

144
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,500
We've broken up.
What are you doing here?

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,980
Pack your things. We're leaving.

146
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,460
What's wrong?

147
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,220
I went to investigate opium,

148
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,460
and ended up offending
the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing.

149
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,020
They're demanding

150
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,060
I hand over 20-dan opium by tomorrow,

151
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,620
or pay a fine

152
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,660
of two million silver dollars,

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,820
or get court-martialed.

154
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,180
Is your master not going to help you?

155
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,420
Don't mention that old geezer.

156
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,140
He made me the scapegoat

157
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,460
just to protect his own future.

158
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,940
How could this happen?

159
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,700
Handing over two million silver dollars

160
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,380
would mean throwing away
everything I've worked for.

161
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Why don't we take the money and flee?

162
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,260
Where would we go?

163
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,180
We've got the money.
We can go wherever we want.

164
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,380
You think I can just leave with you?

165
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,340
Bingxin, don't worry.

166
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,020

168
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,100
come with me.

169
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,420
I'll treat you right
for the rest of my life.

170
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,940
Buy you all sorts of delicious food,

171
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,740
beautiful clothes,

172
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,340
and a big house to live in.

173
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,340
When I make it big,

174
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,020
we'll come back

175
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,140
together

176
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,220
in glory.

177
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,460
The boat is all set,

178
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,740
and we're leaving tonight.

179
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,460
First to Guangzhou,
then to Hong Kong, China.

180
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,900
After that, we'll decide where to go.

181
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,220
Mu,

182
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
I can't go with you.

183
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,420
Why?

184
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,820
I've still got films to shoot

185
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,580
and business to handle.

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,500
At a time like this,

187
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,780
you're still thinking
about making movies?

188
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,180
If I go down,

189
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,900
your business
won't last much longer either.

190
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,940
Yes,

191
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,300
making movies doesn't make much money,

192
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,540
but at least I can make a living.

193
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,660
The business is the same.

194
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,100
It's been tough,

195
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,300
but through all this,

196
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,860
I held it together on my own.

197
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,980
Are you abandoning me for these things?

198
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,740
We've already broken up.

199
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,100
Didn't you promise

200
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,740
you'd be by my side,

201
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,740
no matter what happens?

202
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm sorry, Mu.

203
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,540
I've changed.

204
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,020
I'm doing things my way, for myself.

205
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
Is there someone else you're seeing?

206
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

207
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,260
It must be!

208
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,860
Get out.

209
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,500
I should've seen it coming.

210
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,100
We were never meant

211
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,740
to weather the storm together.

212
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,820
How ironic.

213
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,020
I told you to get out. Go.

214
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,980
I can leave,

215
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,980
but the money comes with me.

216
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,940
What money?

217
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,620
If it weren't for me
these past few years,

218
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,140
you'd have all this?

219
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,220
You don't have to come with me,

220
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,900
but I'm not leaving the money behind.

221
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,380
Mu Ziru.

222
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,580
I'm warning you.

223
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,260
Stay away from my money.

224
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,820
You turned your back on me,

225
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,740
so don't blame me for doing the same.

226
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,380
Get away.

227
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,980
Mu Ziru!

228
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,420
Mu Ziru.

229
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,380
You can't do this to me.

230
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,420
Stop.

231
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,220
Mu Ziru.

232
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,820
I'm calling your master right now

233
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,900
to tell him you're trying to run away!

234
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,500
Come back.

235
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,820
Mu Ziru!

236
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,300
Let go!

237
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,820
No!

238
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,860
No!

239
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,500
No!

240
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,940
Give me that!

241
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,500
Mu Ziru, I beg you.

242
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,180
Please don't!

243
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,380
I worked for that my whole life.

244
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,220
No.

245
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,220
No.

246
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,980
Mu Ziru, I beg you.

247
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,380
Don't do this to me.

248
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,100
Get out of the way!

249
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm gonna kill you!

250
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,940
Go.

251
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,860
Go.

252
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,660
Go!

253
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,900
That brat really took a lot.

254
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,060
US dollars, British pounds,

255
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,460
land deeds, and bankbooks.

256
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
I knew you were greedy,

257
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,860
but I didn't expect you
to be a full-blown thief.

258
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,140
You deserve to die!

259
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,220
[Grave of My Brother Xia Chu]
Xia Chu, I've avenged you.

260
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,260
You can rest in peace now.

261
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,220
Xia Chu,

262
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,300
don't worry.

263
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,620
I'll keep moving forward

264
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,020
to see the world beyond,

265
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,060
and do everything
I've ever wanted to do.

266
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,340
It's my fault.

267
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,460
I'm to blame.

268
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,580
I always gave in to you
when you were little.

269
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,140
I should have been firmer,

270
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,620
kept you at home...

271
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,820
and never let you study abroad.

272
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,100
Then you wouldn't have met
those revolutionaries

273
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,060
and you wouldn't have lost your life.

274
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,580
You couldn't have stopped him.

275
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,140
It was what he believed in.

276
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,580
But what good is a belief

277
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,260
when he's gone?

278
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Wouldn't it have been better...

279
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,420
to be alive and with his family?

280
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,700
Shaohua.

281
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,700
Even though you and Xia Chu
never had a wedding,

282
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,180
in my heart,

283
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,860
you've always been part of the family.

284
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,700
I've invited you twice
to join Shouyuan Apothecary.

285
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,380
You said you wanted to be independent

286
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,020
and turned me down.

287
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,900
But now, you are family.

288
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,380
There's no reason
to say no anymore, is there?

289
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,020
Mr. Xia, I...

290
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Shaohua,

291
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,540
just like Xia Chu,

292
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,620
you can call me Yuan.

293
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,540
Yuan.

294
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,020
Thank you.

295
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,020
I'm entrusting
the entire Shanghai market

296
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,420
to you,

297
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,460
okay?

298
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,260
But

299
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,700
Wen's Pharmacy can't do without me.

300
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,660
We need you even more.

301
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,060
Yuan,

302
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
please give me a moment to think,

303
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,780
okay?

304
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,460
I'll wait.

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,780
Please enjoy your meal.

307
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,820
Miss, please take a seat.

308
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,580
Miss?

309
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,220
Miss?

310
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,380
Why are you here?

311
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,260
Are you here to mock me

312
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,100
for falling for the wrong man again?

313
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,740
I risked our friendship for him,

314
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,540
and he ended up stealing all my money.

315
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,820
I'm so stupid, right?

316
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,900
I guess I was born to be fooled by men.

317
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,740
I'm here to eat.

318
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,660
Go ahead and order.

319
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,500
I'll have

320
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
half a fried flatbread.

321
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,900
The kind sold at the small stall
in Qizhou Medicine Market.

322
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,340
The one that goes for just a wen.

323
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,420
Even though it didn't cost much,

324
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,020
back then,

325
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,740
it already felt like a luxury to us.

326
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,300
I remember that year,

327
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,540
someone gave you a fried flatbread.

328
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,620
You couldn't bear to finish it

329
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,660
and even saved half for me.

330
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,460
Here. Have it.

331
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,540
I saved it just for you.

332
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,940
A fried flatbread.

333
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,900
I can still remember...

334
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,940
the taste of that half fried flatbread.

335
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,940
Erniu,

336
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,900
we are friends.

337
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,260
How could I possibly mock you?

338
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,140
All these years,

339
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,420
we've held each other up

340
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,380
and clawed our way out of the darkness,

341
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,180
until we made it here.

342
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,500
Your suffering is mine.

343
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,900
And I feel...

344
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,820
your pain as well.

345
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,300
Back when I had nothing,

346
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,060
you cried for me.

347
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,100
And now that your life's in chaos,

348
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,260
all I can think about

349
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,780
is doing everything I can

350
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,780
to care for you.

351
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,460
I always thought

352
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,660
Mu Ziru was different.

353
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,980
But in the end, I realized

354
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,620
he was more despicable
than any man I'd ever known.

355
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,380
Why?

356
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,820
Why do all the men I meet
turn out this way?

357
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,140
Is it fate?

358
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,900
Perhaps it's just destiny,

359
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,940
just like Xia Chu and I

360
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,900
were never meant to last.

361
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,620
Are you okay?

362
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,020
Still alive.

363
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,180
And you?

364
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,900
Business keeps getting worse.

365
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,660
I don't know
how much longer it'll hold up.

366
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,500
Do you need my help?

367
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,740
When I do...

368
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,700
I'll ask.

369
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay.

370
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,540
We both came to Shanghai with nothing.

371
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Look at you now.

372
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,180
Your business is thriving.

373
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,260
After everything

374
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,500
I've been through,

375
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,340
I'm still left with nothing.

376
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,900
My luck's just been terrible.

377
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,820
Erniu,

378
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,060
have you ever considered

379
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,740
maybe it's not about luck?

380
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,140
Maybe you took the wrong path
from the very start.

381
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,500
You mean

382
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,500
I shouldn't always be thinking about

383
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,700
how to make money through men?

384
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,660
I should be more like you

385
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,100
and rely on myself.

386
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,060
What I mean is,

387
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,940
money you earn yourself

388
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,140
can't be taken away by anyone else.

389
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,060
Agreed.

390
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Oh, by the way,

391
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,860
I need to tell you something.

392
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,420
Xia Yuan wants me
to join Jujing Apothecary.

393
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,060
Are you going?

394
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,140
This is the third time
he's asked me to join.

395
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,860
On one hand,

396
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,020
he's Xia Chu's brother.

397
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,140
On the other,

398
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,180
the platform he's offering

399
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,740
is much bigger than Wen's Pharmacy.

400
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,380
So,

401
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,740
I might accept his offer.

402
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,140

408
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,700
Amazing.

409

If you go to Jujing Apothecary,

410
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,900
will seeing him
bring back memories of Xia Chu?

411
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,780
I'm just afraid it'll break your heart.

412
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,820
I don't have a heart left to break.

Wait a moment.

419

Take this, just in case.

in this business.

That's true.

Alright, tell me

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,180
about the details of the operation.

434
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,180
That seed is sprouting.

435
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,340
Just got word

436
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,540
that 20 dan of opium,
disguised as medicinal herbs,

437
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,060
was shipped from Hankou to Shanghai.

438
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,340
It's in Warehouse No. 18.

439
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,100
Twenty dan?

440
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,340
Whoever owns that opium

441
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,820
must have some serious influence.

442
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,980
The buyer of this batch of opium

443
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,420
is a trading company in Suzhou.

444
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,220
It seemed like a low-profile firm.

445
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,780
But Mr. Xia spent some money

446
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,380
and used his contacts

447
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,860
to trace it back
to the real power behind it,

448
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,660
Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance.

449
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,820
If that's how it is,

450
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,700
let's send Mu Ziru a proper gift.

451
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,420
At 12 AM.

I dropped off the goods this morning,

but the paperwork was wrong.

456
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,220
My boss asked me to come back
and swap the documents.

457
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,260
Could you open the door for me? Thanks.

473

474
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,180
which had already made him furious.

475
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,100
Now, with the opium case,

476
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,300
he's offended the Ministry of Finance

477
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,180
and embezzled over 100 jin.

00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,340
Even if Mr. Jin were the forgiving type,

479
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,540
there's no way he could keep him around.

480
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,500
Furthermore, Mr. Jin

481
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,860

and fighting among themselves.

486
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,860
Instead of saying Mu Ziru
was taken out by Mr. Jin,

487
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980
it's fairer to say
he got caught in the crossfire.

488
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,500
Mu Ziru's men played a key role too.

489
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
But really, we should thank you

490
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,140
for uncovering Song Ziwen
as the mastermind

491
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,620

492
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,380
that made this possible.

493
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,060

Get rid of it?

Why?

500
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,300
Wouldn't it be better to transport it
to Northeast China?

501

What would we even do with it there?

502
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,980
Sell it.

503
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,660
Sell it?

504
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,860
As medicinal herbs?

505
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,260
It doesn't matter what we call it.

506
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,700
Don't tell me
you're selling it to opium dealers.

507
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,420
Does it matter who buys it?

508
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,780
Mr. Xia, you can't do that.

509
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,020
Why not?

510
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Eighteen dan,

511
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,380
that's a fortune.

512
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,580
You'd throw the nation under the bus
for small money?

513
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,460
Zhiqiu, are you listening to yourself?

514
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,700
This isn't a small amount of money.

515
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,420
It's over a million.

516
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,420
The National Government

517
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,860
acquired it

518
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,180
and planned to sell it

519
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,020
to the public.

520
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,460
So if they can sell it,

521
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,500
why can't I?

522
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,620
Am I supposed to pretend
that money doesn't matter?

523
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,500
Right, Shaohua?

524
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,140
Alright, let's drop it.

525
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,580
Come on, dig in.

526
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,980
Zhiqiu, go ahead.

527
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,100
Some money isn't worth earning.

528
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,780
But I believe

529
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,060
a true businessman

530
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,420
earns it all.

531
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,020
Mr. Xia,

532
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,380
if you really see me as a friend,

533
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,020
just hear me out this once.

534
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,100
Zhiqiu,

535
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,500
I'll go along with you
on everything else,

536
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,260
but on money,

537
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,740
I call the shots.

538
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,180
We came up with this plan,

539
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,900
and I carried it out.

540
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
So let us handle

541
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,180
this batch of goods.

542
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,860
Zhiqiu,

543
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,900
you just said yourself

544
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,700
that this plan was impossible
without me.

545
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,660
So that means I get a share, right?

546
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,300
Okay, here's what we'll do.

547
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I'll just give you your share in money.

548
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,060
Better yet,

549
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,820
I'll sell your share of the goods,

550
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,900
and give you an extra ten percent.

551
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,620
Mr. Xia, if you really mean that,

552
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,020
then maybe we're no longer friends.

553
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,460
Zhiqiu,

554
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,820
if that's how you feel,

555
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm sorry to hear it,

556
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,140
but the goods

557
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,980
are already on the ship.

558
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,900
I'm leaving.

559
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,380
Zhiqiu.

560
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,220
What's gotten into him?

561
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,780
He's never been like this before.

562
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,060
Shaohua.

563
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,380
This one's on me.

564
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,540
I should've talked to you.

565
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,660
I

566
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,740
messed up this time.

567
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,500
It won't happen again, alright?

568
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,780
Yuan.

569
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,820
We run pharmacies

570
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,660
to heal the sick and save lives.

571
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
But opium

572
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,900
destroys people.

573
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,580
And if we make money off it,

574
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,860
we betray everything we stand for.

575
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,340
Yes,

576
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,260
that makes sense.

577
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,100
Running a pharmacy is to save lives.

578
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,980
But let's not forget.

579
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,740
It's also about making money.

580
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,380
If you're not turning a profit,

581
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,460
you're betraying your purpose too.

582
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,420
Isn't that right?

583
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,820
And even if we take a step back,

584
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,300
those who use opium

585
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,340
are beyond saving.

586
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,020
Their deaths mean nothing.

587
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,220
If Xia Chu were still here...

588
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,740
how do you think
he'd try to change your mind?

589
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
Alright, Shaohua.

590
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,940
Let's not talk about this.

591
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,100
Let's drop it.

592
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,660
Um,

593
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,820
when are you starting
at Jujing Apothecary?

594
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,460
I've thought it through.

595
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,180
Mr. Xia,

596
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,580
I will stay at Wen's Pharmacy.

597
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,180
Why?

598
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,700
I just feel like Wen Zhiqiu and I

599
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,620
are a better fit.

600
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,420
Excuse me,

601
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,380
I've got something urgent

602
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
to take care of.

603
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll head out.

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,100

606
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,140

Okay, thank you.

What's going on?

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,420
So much meat?

619
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,980
We got paid today, didn't we?

620
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,500
How much did you get?

621
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,940
Twenty silver dollars.

622
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,460
You got 20,

623
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,700
and I got 32.

624
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,900
Together, we got more than 50.

625
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,660
We should celebrate with a great meal.

626
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,580
What's there to celebrate?

627
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,660
Listen, Shaozhong,

628
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,260
I saw it with my own eyes.

629
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,860

631
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,740
got around fifty or sixty.

632
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,340
Check this out. So great.

633
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,700
Let's not compare ourselves to them.

634
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,700
Why not?

635
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,820
We're just as close and just as senior.

636
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,900
How are we any less?

637
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,940
Why should we get shortchanged?

638
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,340
You should think about it this way.

639
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,660
Compared to back in Peking,

640
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,980
the life we're living now

641
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,300
is a life of luxury,

642
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,020
isn't it?

643
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,860
We could do better.

644
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,900
Alright.

645
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,580
It'll be better.

Where's Bao?

It's so late.

648
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,140
Why isn't he back yet?

649
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,180
Did they hold him back at school again?

650
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,180
- This brat.
- It's fine.

651
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,340
He'll be back soon.

Where's the knife?

Aren't they your principal and teacher?

659

Yes.

660
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,980

- Put down the knife!

You...

669
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
Did you just spit at me?
What's gotten into you?

Mr. Wen said Cheng Hui
is going to study abroad,

by the office.

No matter how desperate I am,

719
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,700
I wouldn't go after a friend's man.

720
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,860
I meant to ask

721
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,140
if you're going to win Shaohua back.

722
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,900
Forget it.

You don't love her now?

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,660
Xia Chu's gone.

726
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,900
That's why I'm not going after her.

727
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,100
Wen Zhiqiu,

728
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,580
you're really not like any guy

729
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,660
I know.

730
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,140
How so?

731
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,740
You're too much of a gentleman.

732
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,500
You backed off

733
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,780
because of someone else.

734
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,420
But they're gone now.
So why are you still hesitating?

735
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,740
Let me be honest with you.

736
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,420
Shaohua's not doing well.

737
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,580
I'm really worried about her.

738
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,900
What's going on with her?

739
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,460
See?

740
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,260
You still care about her, don't you?

741
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,260
She might seem fine,

742
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,220
but she's not the same anymore.

743
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,580
There's no light in her eyes.

744
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,620
She's lost that spark she used to have.

745
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,700
So if you really care,

746
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,380
let's not just stand by

747
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,660
and help her find herself again.

748
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,780

00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,140

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,100
what you'd tell her?

752
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,740
Aunt,

753
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,060
every time I see you,

754
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,700
I feel more connected to you
than to my own mother.

755
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,700
And what else?

756
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Aunt, can I be your son?

757
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,420
I promise I'll treat you well.

758
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,660
Keep that in mind.

759
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,580
Honestly, I think

760
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,140
you're wasting your time.

761
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,380
If Shaohua truly wants a son,

762
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,100
she can have one herself.

763
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,380
With the way her life's turned out,

764
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,580
do you really think she could?

765
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,020
What are you talking about?

766
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,060
Bao, quit sneaking bites.

767
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,980
Put it down.

768
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,940
Did you hear me?

769
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,780
Stop right there.

770
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,500
Watch where you're going!

771
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,420
You...

772
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,180
- How dare you talk to Aunt like that!
- Watch your tone!

773
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:08,900
Shaohua.

774
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,580
That's no way to talk to Aunt.

775
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,220
Come in.

776
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,060
Sit down.

777
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,100
Alright, that's enough.

778
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
Shaohua is here.

779
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,700
Come on, Shaohua.

780
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,420
Shaohua, take a seat.

781
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,700
Come on.

782
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,500
Sit down.

783
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,180
What a waste.

784
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,540
It's been a while.

785
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,900
Bao's grown so much.

786
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,020
He's grown taller, but not wiser.

787
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,300
Shaohua, it's kind of a squeeze in here

788
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,500
with everyone around.

789
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,340
Bao,

790
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,900
didn't you say you missed Aunt?

791
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,220
She is here.

792
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,420
Aunt,

793
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,140
every time I see you,

794
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,060
I feel more connected to you
than to my own mother.

795
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,020
Is that so?

796
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,940
Yes, it is.

797
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,700
He's always saying
how much he misses Aunt

798
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,300
and that Aunt must miss him too.

799
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,220
Right, Bao?

800
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,300
Aunt,

801
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,260
can I be your son?

802
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,500
I promise I'll treat you well.

803
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,340
Look at him.

804
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,980
Trying to be his aunt's son.

805
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,100
Guess you're done with me, huh?

806
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,980
Bao,

807
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,620
if you want to be my son,

808
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,580
from now on, you'll have to

809
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,820
get 100 on every subject

810
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,780
and you'd better be top-notch
in behavior too.

811
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,980
Can you do that?

812
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,140
Forget it.

813
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,180
Bao.

814
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,700
Didn't you hear that?

815
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,020
Perfect scores in every subject.

816
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,420
How am I supposed to survive that?

817
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,140
What are you talking about?

818
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,220
Why can't you get 100?

819
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,020
- Enough.
- Chu Xiaobao!

820
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,420
Shaohua rarely comes over for dinner.

821
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,580
Come on, don't bring that up right now.

822
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,180
This little brat.

823
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,820
Shaohua,

824
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,220
come on, dig in.

825
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,020
Shaozhong, you should eat more.

826
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,580
You seem to have slimmed down a little.

827
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,660
Really?

828
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,100
Yes, Shaohua.

829
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,580
Your brother has lost some weight.

830
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,620
He works

831
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,420
the hardest at the shop,

832
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,620
but gets paid the least.

833
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,300
It's fine.

834
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,100
Salary depends on how much work you do

835
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
and how well you do it.

836
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,100
Shaozhong gets paid for what he puts in.

837
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
It should be fine.

838
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,820
Yes.

839
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,460
Shaohua,

840
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,380
he is your brother.

841
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,740
Can't you give him some help?

842
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,700
I can help him

843
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,340
with his daily life,

844
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,660
but when it comes to work,

845
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,740
breaking the rules of the pharmacy

846
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,260
would lead to big problems.

847
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,660
Speaking of life,

848
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,980
Shaohua, I have to tell you something.

849
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,700
Bao was expelled from school.

850
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,860
Why?

851
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,500
You know how boys are.

852
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,300
They tend to mess around
and get into fights sometimes.

853
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,580
It's no surprise they end up
with a few bruises.

854
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,260
But the principal just won't let it go.

855
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,500
He even kicked Bao out of school.

856
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,340
Shaohua,

857
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,860
can you talk to the school

858
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,660
and ask them to reconsider?

859
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,300
Well...

860
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,580
Shaohua, let's not go begging.

861
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,540
We'll just transfer him
to another school.

862
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,380
I hear St. Francis Xavier's College
is pretty good.

863
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,340
We can have Bao study there instead.

864
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,100
Do you even know

865
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,380
how much the tuition is for a year?

866
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,900
It can't be pricier
than going abroad, right?

867
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,220
Whether it's St. Francis Xavier's
or an overseas school,

868
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,420
as long as his grades are good enough,

869
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,620
I'm behind him all the way.

870
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,700
But I suppose

871
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,420
he's probably given up on studying,
hasn't he?

872
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,220
That's exactly what's giving me
a headache.

873
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,020
He just has no interest in studying,

874
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,900
and I don't think he's cut out
for schoolwork.

875
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,780
If that's the case,

876
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,060
maybe it's time he picked up a skill.

877
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,220
That's also a way out.

878
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,780
What about the money?

879
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,380
What money?

880
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,380
The money for Bao
to attend St. Francis Xavier's College

881
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,220
and to study abroad.

882
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,260
Then,

883
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,740
shouldn't all the money go to Bao?

884
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,220
If he's not even studying,

885
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,580
why should we give it to him?

886
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,820
If he's not studying,
why don't we use this money

887
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,620
to get Bao some assets?

888
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,060
After all, it's meant for him.
