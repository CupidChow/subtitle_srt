00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,700
The one who was taken by bandits?

374
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,700
From the Chen family?

375
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,020
Yes.

376
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,260
How could you possibly know her?

377
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,060
We met twelve years ago.

378
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,540
I fell in love with her back then.

379
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,940
But fate kept pulling us apart

380
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,300
again and again.

381
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,820
Didn't you say
Wen Zhiqiu had a thing for Miss Chu?

382
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,940
Really?

383
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,380
Shaohua never mentioned it.

384
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,260
It shouldn't be a big deal.

385
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,540
If she's the one you've chosen,

386
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,700
I won't support it.

387
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,780
Why?

388
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,780
You know her past.

389
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,140
I know what you know

390
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,060
and what you don't.

391
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,340
Then why do you still want to marry her?

392
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,500
Her past

393
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,500
only makes me feel

394
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,740
more compassion, respect,
and love for her.

395
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,580
Break up with her now.

396
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,660
Mother,

397
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,980
she's the one
I want to spend my life with.

398
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,220
Choose her,

399
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,580
and forget you ever had a mother!

400
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,500
Mother,

401
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,860
no matter who I marry,

402
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,060
it won't change the fact
that you are my mother,

403
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,020
and I am your son.

404
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Likewise,

405
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,420
no matter what you say,

406
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
it won't change my mind

407
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,780
about marrying Shaohua.

408
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,780
Mother.

409
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,540
Are you trying to make me explode?

410
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,780
I've never laid a hand on you
since you were a child.

411
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
But today, I swear
I'll give you a good beating!

412
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,980
You're way out of line!

413
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,220
Mother.

414
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,980
This is outrageous!

415
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,700
It's my fault.

416
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,300
You've really gone too far!

417
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,380
I'm the one

418
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,140
to blame.

419
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,740
You're asking for a beating!

420
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,940
Go ahead, hit me if you must.

421
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,820
I don't want you to hurt your hands.

422
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,380
Take it easy, Mother.

423
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:05,940
Mother.

424
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,260
Mother.

425
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,220
You know what Chu is like.

426
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,180
He's unstoppable
once he's made up his mind.

427
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
Let me try to talk some sense into him.

428
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,700
Please don't be upset

429
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
and get some rest.

430
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,900
He cannot marry that woman.

431
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,620
Mother, let's go.

432
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,580
I don't agree.

433
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,100
He cannot marry her!

434
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,380
I won't allow it.

435
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,100
Like mother, like son.

436
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,780
That temper runs deep.

437
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,660
Yuan.

438
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,820
I made you take the hit again.

439
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,180
The last time I got beaten for you

440
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,180
must've been
over twenty years ago, right?

441
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,220
Today, that feeling came rushing back.

442
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,620
Xia Chu,

443
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,500
you're serious

444
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,380
about being with Shaohua?

445
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,300
Of course.

446
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,420
Why does it have to be her?

447
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,460
Why can't it be her?

448
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,180
With your talent

449
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,340
and our family's influence,

450
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,940
all of Shanghai,

451
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,540
no, all of China, is within your reach.

452
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,180
But Shaohua

453
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,020
is unique.

454
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,940
That's not something I want to hear.

455
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,260
What about Mother?

456
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,740
We only have one mother.

457
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,380
But if I really had to

458
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,620
choose between her and Shaohua,

459
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,300
I'd choose Shaohua.

460
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Blood ties never break.

461
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,780
But if Shaohua and I...

462
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,020
part ways,

463
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,340
we'll never find our way back
to each other.

464
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,940
What about Mother then?

465
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,020
She's getting old.

466
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,020
If you insist on being so headstrong,

467
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,940
and something happens to her
because of it...

468
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,700
Yuan,

469
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,620
I need your help convincing Mother.

470
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,780
Yuan.

471
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,380
I can help you.

472
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,860
Xia Chu,

473
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
when will you come back to help me?

474
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,300
Once China is united

475
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,700
and at peace,

476
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,300
I'll be back to help you.

477
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,900
At peace?

478
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,180
Who knows when that'll ever happen.

479
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
It's not as far off...

480
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,060
as it seems.

481
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,260
Are you saying the world

482
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,780
is about to turn upside down?

483
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm leaving.

484
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
I need to take care of something
at school.

485
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,620
Xia Chu.

486
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,220
I'm leaving our matter to you.

487
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,700
Miss Chu may be capable,

488
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,380
but she was once married
and had a child.

489
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,580
She was even taken by bandits

490
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,740
and no one really knows
what she went through.

491
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,460
And now she's always

492
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,260
with Wen Zhiqiu.

493
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,220
How could Xia Chu possibly

494
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,820
be into someone like her?

495
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,140
Xia Chu's never been one
to play by the rules.

496
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,420
So it's no surprise he'd fall

497
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,500
for someone like Chu Shaohua.

498
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,500
Mother said

499
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,260
it's out of the question.

500
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,980
She also asked me to tell you

501
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,060
to find a way to break them up.

502
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,020
Break them up?

503
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,140
One is my younger brother,

504
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,660
and the other is my business partner.

505
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,900
Neither is someone I can truly control.

506
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,660
So you're just going to stay out of it?

507
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
Honestly, I think

508
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,540
if Xia Chu and Chu Shaohua
end up together,

509
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,140
it might not be such a bad thing.

510
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,420
If they get married,

511
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,980
it's more of a gain than a gamble

512
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,180
for my business.

513
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,380
You support them?

514
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,980
The real problem now

515
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,540
is Wen Zhiqiu.

516
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,100
If he pulls out

517
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,260
because of this,

518
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,820
I'll take a serious hit.

519
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,460
I need to find a way
to smooth things over with him.

520
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,620
What about Mother?

521
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,940
Let me think.

522
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,860
You'll need to figure out

523
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,340
how to calm her down.

524
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,780
[Wen's Pharmacy]

525
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,340
Hello? Wen's Pharmacy.

526
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,260
[Richards Hotel]

527
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,540
Miss Chu,

528
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,860
this may be our first encounter,

529
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,020
but I've heard quite a bit

530
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,700
about your past.

531
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,380
Madam, I've been looking forward
to meeting you, too.

532
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,900
Let's be direct.

533
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,460
I deeply sympathize

534
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,140
with your experiences

535
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,180
and greatly admire

536
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,300
your talents.

537
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,980
I am one hundred percent in favor

538
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,980
of you doing business with Xia Yuan.

539
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,100
However, I am completely

540
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,460
against you marrying Xia Chu.

541
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,820
But I guess your opposition

542
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,700
didn't do much, did it?

543
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,740
If it had,

544
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,620
you wouldn't be here talking to me.

545
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,660
Quit the tough talk.

546
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,580
Sure, these days

547
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,900
people talk about
choosing who they love and marry.

548
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,980
But I'm still Xia Chu's mother.

549
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
He might not listen to me now,

550
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,140
but one day, he will!

551
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,500
But from what I know of Xia Chu,

552
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,500
once he makes up his mind,

553
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,420
no one can change it.

554
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,140
Actually, Miss Chu, I came today

555
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,180
for your own good.

556
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,420
Think about it.

557
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,820
Why insist

558
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,860
on the impossible?

559
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,660
You might as well let go
as soon as possible.

560
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,420
While you're still
in the prime of your youth,

561
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,260
find a man who's a good match for you.

562
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,780
Wouldn't that be better?

563
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,340
I feel like Xia Chu and I
are a great fit.

564
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,220
Miss Chu,

565
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,540
are you even hearing yourself right now?

566
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,820
Madam, then please tell me.

567
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,180
What exactly makes you think
Xia Chu and I

568
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,500
aren't a good match?

569
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,340
Alright,

570
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,700
then let's start with family background
and social status.

571
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,660
Our family,

572
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,260
from Shouyuan Apothecary

573
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,220
to Jujing Apothecary,

574
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,700
is a well-known name in the TCM world.

575
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,300
Your family, on the other hand,

576
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,780
might have been a big deal
in Qizhou a hundred years ago,

577
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,780
but you're now in decline
and no longer taken seriously.

578
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,780
Isn't that the truth?

579
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:51,900
Yes, it is.

580
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,740
Then let's talk about you two.

581
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,220
Xia Chu

582
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,620
studied business in Japan

583
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,300
before moving to France.

584
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,460
I'm not saying he's the most brilliant,

585
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,820
but he is definitely well-versed
in both Eastern and Western cultures.

586
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,300
And you?

587
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,740
You've never even gone to a single day

588
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,140
of a modern Western school

589
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,420
or a traditional Chinese one, have you?

590
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,900
Indeed, I haven't.

591
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,060
Besides,

592
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,100
you were once married,

593
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,980
you had a child,

594
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,700
and you are a widow.

595
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,260
Mother.

596
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,580
Xia Chu

597
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,860
comes from a distinguished

598
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,100
and unblemished lineage.

599
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,500
Miss Chu,

600
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,300
we didn't mean
to bring up anything painful.

601
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,300
I understand.

602
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,500
You have to be reasonable, you know.

603
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
So, do you think

604
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,580
you're good enough for Xia Chu?

605
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,660
What makes you think you deserve him?

606
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,420
Mother.

607
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,340
Madam.

608
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,100
My family may have fallen on hard times,

609
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,340
but I'm still

610
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,300
the general manager of Wen's Pharmacy.

611
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,660
Even your son, Xia Yuan,

612
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,380
treats me with respect when we meet.

613
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,740
Sure, I didn't go to school.

614
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,100
But understanding how the world works

615
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,220
and how to deal with people
is real wisdom.

616
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,100
With the insight

617
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,780
I've gained,

618
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,620
I am no less than
any well-educated socialite.

619
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,860
Yes, I am a widow

620
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,500
and I had a child.

621
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,140
We're not so different, are we?

622
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,460
You're a widow

623
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,500
and a mother.

624
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,260
Judging me for my situation

625
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,620
says more about your character
than mine.

626
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,580
You...

627
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,860
You just aren't good enough for Xia Chu.

628
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,580
By your logic,

629
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,820
things like family status,

630
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,500
background, or education

631
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,620
make me unworthy of Xia Chu.

632
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,620
But if a marriage

633
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,500
is measured only by those things,

634
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,940
Madam,

635
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
forgive my bluntness,

636
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
you weren't worthy
of your husband either.

637
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,460
What do you think you are saying?

638
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,220
You were born into a poor family.

639
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,740
To survive,

640
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,940
you joined a Bangzi Opera troupe
to learn singing.

641
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,460
After the troupe disbanded,

642
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,380
you became Mr. Xia's concubine

643
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,980
just to make ends meet.

644
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,700
Later,

645
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,700
when his wife passed away,

646
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,740
you became his legal wife.

647
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,140
If we go by your standards,

648
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,900
your marriage to the Xia family

649
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,100
was also a mismatch.

650
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,420
Your background

651
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,220
didn't match their status either.

652
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,220
You!

653
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,860
Mother.

654
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,300
She's talking nonsense.

655
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,220
Please don't let it get to you.

656
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,780
Calm down.

657
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,740
Yes, what I just said

658
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,180
was all nonsense.

659
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,220
What I truly want to say is this.

660
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,380
Madam,

661
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,220
you gave the Xia family
two outstanding sons,

662
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,780
Xia Yuan and Xia Chu.

663
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,300
After your husband passed away

664
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,700
and the family fell on hard times,

665
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,620
you single-handedly

666
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,140
kept the household afloat

667
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,020
and laid the foundation for Xia Yuan

668
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,140
to restore the family's legacy.

669
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,180
The success your family enjoys today

670
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,980
is thanks to you,
who were once considered unworthy

671
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
but made all the difference.

672
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,620
Yes, my mother
is also an extraordinary woman.

673
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,740
Even after everything
you've done for the Xia family,

674
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,020
some of them still

675
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,900
judge you

676
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,260
for your background.

677
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,140
You've lived through the very bias
you're now applying to me.

678
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,860
So why impose the same standard

679
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,940
on Xia Chu and me?

680
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,460
I've spent my whole life being judged.

681
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,700
I just don't want my daughter-in-law

682
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,140
to suffer the same fate.

683
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,980
Most of my life

684
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,580
has been full of hardship.

685
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,180
I endured and persevered

686
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,500
through everything by myself,

687
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,340
and that's how I made it
to where I am today.

688
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,020
If you ask me what scares me,

689
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,380
I'd say nothing.

690
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,460
Even with a knife to my throat,

691
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,780
I wouldn't flinch.

692
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,100
I believe

693
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,180
my fate

694
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,580
is in my hands.

695
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,020
Fine.

696
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,860
So you've made up your mind

697
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,420
to stand against me, huh?

698
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm just set

699
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,980
on loving Xia Chu,
fully, fearlessly, and without regret.

700
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,340
Impossible!

701
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,380
We'll see about that.

702
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,100
Mother.

703
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,140
Shaohua,

704
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,580
you're incredible.

705
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,580
You have my support.

706
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,100
Mother.

707
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,860
The next two years

708
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,700
will bring even more domestic turmoil.

709
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,220
We need to plan ahead.

710
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,620
Xia Yuan!

711
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,380
Mother, what are you doing?

712
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,500
I think this is something

713
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
you need to handle yourself!

714
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,620
Madam.

715
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,140
Madam.

716
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,140
Mother, take a seat.

717
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,300
Please calm down.

718
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,660
What happened?

719
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,140
Mother met with Miss Chu,

720
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,460
and Miss Chu left her speechless.

721
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:58,900
Let me handle it.

722
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,180
Mother, please have some tea.

723
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,620
Xia Yuan,

724
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,660
you and Miss Chu

725
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,220
are doing business together, aren't you?

726
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,780
Yes.

727
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,660
Pressure her in business

728
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,140
until she backs off.

729
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:17,900
Mother.

730
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,780
That's not appropriate, is it?

731
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,900
Business and personal feelings

732
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,180
should remain separate.

733
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,900
What feelings?

734
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,940
Are you just going to stand by
and let her harm Xia Chu?

735
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,700
Mother.

736
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,820
Honestly,

737
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,220
maybe Miss Chu

738
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,260
really is Xia Chu's lucky star.

739
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,300
What are you talking about?

740
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:40,900
Please hear me out.

741
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,820
Back then,

742
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,620
for the sake

743
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,020
of his so-called career,

744
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,420
he walked away from his home,

745
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,500
and nearly his life.

746
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,140
He wouldn't listen to a word we said.

747
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,660
But now that Miss Chu is in the picture,

748
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,820
someone he truly cares about,

749
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,820
he's not going
to throw everything away like before.

750
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,700
Maybe that's not such a bad thing
after all.

751
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
So she's got you under her spell too.

752

I'm just stating the facts.

And indeed,

755
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,780
I've been collaborating a lot

756
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,100
with Miss Chu in my business,

757
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,660
and I still need her help.

758
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,500
To fall out with her now

759
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,620
would just be throwing money away.

760
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,820
Yes, Mother.

761
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,580
Fine!

762
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,420
It seems none of you

763

are listening to me anymore!

764
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,500
Mother, where are you going?

765
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,580
To the hospital!

Okay.

769
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,220
I understand.

770
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,820
I'll give that some thought.

771
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Be more careful.

772
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,220
Don't make any more mistakes.

773
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,340
Miss Chu, you have a visitor.

774
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,580
Let's go over it together
once you're done.

775
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,260
Okay.

776
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,700
Alright.

777
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,660
Why are you here?

778
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,140
I heard my mother came to you

779
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,940
and gave you a hard time.

780
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,900
It's fine.

781
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,260
I'm sorry.

782
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,580
I couldn't make them accept you,

783
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,180
and you had to put up with all that.

784
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,700
Don't worry.

785
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,060
I know how to stand up for myself.

786
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,620
Good.

787
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,620
Actually, your mother

788
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,820
used to approve of me.

789
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,100
She always had your brother tell me

790
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,100
to drop by your place

791
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,340
whenever I had a moment.

792
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,060
But now...

793
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,100
I understand.

794
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,180
Maybe she even hates me

795
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,500
more than anyone else.

796
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,900
That's because

797
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,540
she only sees you

798
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,420
as Yuan's capable business partner.

799
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,500
She doesn't realize

800
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,700
how great you are

801
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,340
as a daughter-in-law.

802
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,900
I'll take care of my mother.

803
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
You don't need to worry about that.

804
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,700
I should do something too, right?

805
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,940
Just focus on one thing.

806
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,740

Okay.

Yes.

822

825

My family is in business.

is how deeply I love her.

There are just so many words.

907
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,220
I can't seem to remember them all.

908
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,900
There's a trick
to memorizing English words.

909
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,540
Just like Chinese characters
have radicals and components,

910
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,980
English words
have their own structure too.

911
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,860
Let's take this word as an example:

912
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,540
Progress.

913
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,540
It's made up of two parts,

914
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,260
"pro" and "gress."

915
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,100
"Pro" means forward,

916
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,180
and "gress" means step.

917
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,700
So together, it means to move forward.

918
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,420
It really is.
