This is my divorce agreement

I had to pay her
an extra 20,000 US dollars

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,820
so she would cooperate with your act.

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,210

189
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,980
guests, clerks,

190
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,340
merchants alike.

191
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,980
That's only for now.

192
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,420
If I can't get the Miracle Pill,

193
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,820
the Japanese will never let me go.

194
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,540
They will destroy all my businesses
in Northeast and North China.

195
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,740
So, you're getting
the formula for the Japanese?

196
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,380
Does it even matter
who it's for at this point?

197
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,460
The important thing is to survive.

198
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,620
You just promised me

199
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,340
you'd never give the formula
to the Japanese.

200
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,500
Then what about me?

201
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,140
The only way they'll help me

202
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,420
is if I give them the Miracle Pill.

203
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,140
You lied to me.

204
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,460
You're really hung up on that?

205
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,900
Is it going to help?

206
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,900
Chu Shaohua lied to you too,

207
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,220
so why can't I?

208
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,620
Xia Yuan,

209
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,820
how could you do this to me?

210
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,500
Because you're an idiot!

211
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,060
I actually believed
you could get the Miracle Pill.

212
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,380
I even considered marrying you!

213
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,340
Turns out I'm just as much a fool
as you are.

214
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,940
We're losing people by the day.

215
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,660
It's getting dire.

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
You are ordered

217
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,020
to evacuate from Shanghai
to Hong Kong, China.​

218
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,380
The sooner you leave, the better.

219
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,020
What about the work I'm responsible for?

220
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,620
Someone else will take over.

221
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,540
I'll proceed as instructed.

222
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,900
However, Shaohua

223
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,860
may not be on the KMT agents'

224
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,780
arrest list,

225
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,460
but she's being targeted by the Japanese

226
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,500
and the bureaucratic capitalists

227
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,780
within the National Government.

228
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,940
Shanghai isn't safe for her either.

229
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,940
This has been taken care of.

230
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,180
Don't be concerned.

231
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,860
Shaohua's safety is no private matter.

232
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,420
It concerns the struggle
against Japanese aggression,

233
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,380
and the future of TCM.

234
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay.

235
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,460
Also,

236
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,620
you have got special approval.

237
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,340
So before you leave,

238
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,220
you can tell Shaohua everything.

239
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,180
What do you mean?

240
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,900
Shaohua may not be one of us yet,

241
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,380
but her actions

242
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,660
have shown

243
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,460
she's a friend we can trust.

244
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,380
So

245
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,460
it's time you tell her

246
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,180
about who you really are

247
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,700
and what happened to Xia Chu.

248
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,980
You failed again!

249
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,020
You good-for-nothing!

250
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,180
Idiot!

251
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,820
There were some accidents.

252
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,260
Accidents?

253
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,460
You Chinese

254
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,660
are always full of empty boasts.

255
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,020
You're pushing me over the edge!

256
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,700
We still have a chance.

257
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,060
Not for you.

258
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,900
After all we've been through,

259
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,380
please help me.

260
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,900
It's not just for me. It's for you,

261
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,540
and for your nation.

262
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,980
I'm offering you one final chance.

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,660
Okay.

264
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,900
This time, you will do as I say.

265
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,380
Okay.

266
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,060
You're back.

267
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,900
Haven't grabbed a bite yet, huh?

268
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,900
I made fish today.

269
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,020
Saved half just for you.

270
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,940
It's extra fresh, I promise.

271
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,580
Shaohua,

272
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,820
look.

273
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,140
Sun really went above and beyond!

274
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,420
Both his own newspaper

275
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,220
and his friends' carried my story!

276
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,780
And all included photos. Look!

277
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,540
Here.

278
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,740
It's okay.

279
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,500
As long as we keep running forward,

280
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,700
even if it bubbles up again,

281
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,740
it won't cling to us, right?

282
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,500
No matter where I go,

283
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,100
you'll always be my dearest friend.

284
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,940
What happened two days ago
made the papers.

285
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,660
What happened?

286
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,220
I'll make a call.

287
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,620
When a pro-Japanese official
was speaking,

288
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,620
someone jumped out from the press,

289
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,500
pulled a revolver,

290
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,380
and cried "Down with the traitors
to our resistance!"

291
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,940
Then he fired three shots.

292
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Three shots in a row?

293
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,180
That reporter's got such nerve

294
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,820
to try to kill
the Premier of the Executive Yuan.

295
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,500
And what about him now?

296
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,140
Dead.

297
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,260
Really?

298
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Sir, let me see.

299
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,780
Right before he died,

300
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,460
[Journalist Shoots Pro-Japan Figure]
he told the person close to him,

301
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,820
"Take a look at the map.

302
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,820
Is all of North and Northeast China

303
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,620
still ours?

304
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,620
We're going to lose our country

305
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,260
and become slaves in our fallen nation."

306
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,020
But whenever you need me,

307
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,380
I'll stand by you.

308
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,340
I wish I had known you earlier.

309
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,460
It's never too late.

310
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,860
Let's be friends forever.

311
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,900
Okay.

312
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,660
Let go!

313
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,700
Hands off me!

314
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,860
Shaohua.

315
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,100
Someone invited you
for wontons at 8 PM tonight.

316
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,660
I accepted for you.

317
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,620
[East Asia Hotel]

318
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,380
Erniu.

319
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,940
We have one last chance.

320
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,700
What did you say?

321
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,940
The two of us?

322
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,420
Yes.

323
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,220
Now, call Chu Shaohua

324
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,380
and ask her over.

325
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
What are you going to do?

326
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,740
I need to have a serious talk with her.

327
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,940
Xia Yuan.

328
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,420
We have broken up.

329
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,020
Don't think I'm just going to do

330
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,940
whatever you say.

331
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,300
Erniu.

332
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,980
Are you still upset with me?

333
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm leaving you.

334
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,220
I gave you

335
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,980
everything you have.

336
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,980
Do you really want to walk away from me?

337
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes.

338
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,780
You gave me money,

339
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,540
status,

340
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,700
and a public image,

341
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,140
but you also made me indifferent,

342
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,620
callous, and devoid of shame.

343
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,660
You made me betray Shaohua.

344
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,580
You've turned me into someone

345
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,100
I don't even recognize.

347
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,140
You need to see things as they are.

348
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,260
I know what you want.

349
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,020
Come on.

350
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,380
Just make this call to Shaohua,

351
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,140
and that marriage arrangement
will still stand.

352
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,740
I can grant you

353
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,940
the marriage, the reputation,

354
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,220
and the money.

355
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,460
Mr. Xia,

356
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,620
people change.

357
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
I'm done with those things.

358
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,460
I've had enough

359
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,060
of status and wealth.

360
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,740
Your tricks don't work on me anymore.

361
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,180
So tell me,

362
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,540
what exactly do you want?

363
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,300
What you said is absolutely right.

364
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,100
I am foolish indeed.

365
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,580
I've fought for so long,

366
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,060
only to realize what I truly want

367
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,420
is not money at all.

I can give you something real.

You can't.

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,060
Please, Erniu.

377
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,780
I beg of you.

378
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
Please

379
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,340
don't leave me.

380
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,100
I've lost too many loved ones already.

381
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,060
I can't bear to lose you too.

382
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,180
You want me by your side, don't you?

383
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,340
You don't want me to leave, right?

384
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,860
Promise me one thing,

385
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,700
and I'll stay.

386
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,740
I promise you.

387
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,340
Anything.

388
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,180
Cut ties with the Japanese.

389
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,220
Are you crazy?

390
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,300
Snap out of it, Erniu.

391
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,340
If I cut ties with them,

392
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,660
what do you think will happen?

393
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Both Shouyuan and Jujing Apothecaries
will be ruined!

394
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,740
What about my many clerks?

395
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,940
What about my family?

396
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,740
They'll all die!

397
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,580
What about me?

398
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,780
I won't make it either!

399
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,660
I'm telling you,

400
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,260
by then, you'll get nothing.

401
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,420
Xia Yuan,

402
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,620
I finally heard the truth from you.

403
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,460
What?

404
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,500
But it's too late.

405
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,060
Nothing you say

406
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,180
matters anymore.

407
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,860
I've lost it all.

408
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,380
I don't want anything.

409
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,860
I won't be a traitor.

410
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,860
Just because you don't want to be,
doesn't mean you aren't.

411
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,500
Listen,

412
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,900
to everyone else,
you're no different from me.

413
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,180
A traitor!

414
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
And I'm telling you,

415
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,660
Chu Shaohua's seen you
as an enemy for a long time.

416
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,940
She's wanted you dead for years.

417
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,340
We have no retreat.

418
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,140
We can only go all out!

419
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,980
If Shaohua comes for revenge one day,

420
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,100
I'll accept it.

421
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,820
And if the Japanese

422
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,660
or the people come
to settle scores with you,

423
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,420
you'll have to accept it too.

424
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,180
No!

425
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,860
Never!

426
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,540
We're going our separate ways, Mr. Xia.

427
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,980
Shaohua, shouldn't you be
off work by now?

428
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,700
I've got a few documents to go through.

429
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,700
You have a date at 8 PM, you know.

430
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,620
Isn't it only 5:30?

431
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,940
Aren't you heading home to change,

432
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,580
do your makeup,

433
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,660
and get all dressed up?

434
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,900
You're awfully nosy.

435
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,700
That's my job, isn't it?

436
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,540
Thank you.

437
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,820
Could you sort these papers for me?

438
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,940
Hello, Chichun Apothecary.

439
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,420
Shaohua.

440
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,820
It's me.

441
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,500
Miss Bai, what's up?

442
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,660
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,580
Xia Yuan and I are completely finished.

444
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:56,900
Speak.

445
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm at East Asia Hotel, room 606.

446
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,660
Could you come and keep me company?

447
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,860
Now?

448
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,180
Continue.

449
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,340
Shaohua, I'm dying.

450
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,140
Erniu, are you okay?

451
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,780
Shaohua, I don't have much time left.

452
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,940
Could you come and keep me company?

453
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
East Asia Hotel?

454
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,820
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

455
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,660
Shaohua!

456
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,460
Shaohua, don't come!

457
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,420
Don't, Shaohua!

458
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,540
Xia Yuan forced me!

459
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,060
Erniu?

460
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,580
He made me do it!

461
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,260
Erniu!

462
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,940
Erniu!

463
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,260
Miss Chu.

464
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,660
What did you do to Erniu?

465
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,180
She's fine for now.

466
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,980
Xia Yuan, what exactly do you want?

467
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
I want to talk about our cooperation.

468
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Forget about it.

469
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,140
It's not going to happen.

470
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,020
Bring the Miracle Pill formula
to the East Asia Hotel room 606

471
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,220
before 6 PM.

472
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,220
Come here,

473
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,820
and I'll let Erniu go.

474
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,220
I said it's impossible.

475
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,740
Then you'll never see her again.

476
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,540
Shaohua.

477
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,300
Xia Yuan caught Erniu.

478
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,260
Hello, Wen's Pharmacy?

479
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,780
I'm looking for Wen.

480
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Don't bother waiting.

481
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,660
She's not coming.

482
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,500
I thought so, too.

483
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
But the second you told her

484
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,500
to stay away,

485
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,660
I knew for sure

486
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,940
that she would.

487
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,900
When is she going to get here?

488
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
We agreed to meet at 6 PM,

489
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,540
so she should be arriving now.

490
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,900
Even if she comes,

491
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,940
she won't cooperate with you.

492
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,340
As long as she comes,

493
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,340
she won't have a choice.

494
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,660
If she listens to reason

495
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,700
and cooperates,

496
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,300
this whole thing will be simple.

497
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,180
I'll talk her into it.

498
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,100
Bring the box in.

499
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,340
Is the sedative ready?

500
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,300
Yes, sir.

501
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,900
Mr. Komura, what is this for?

502
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,220
If she won't come around,

503
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,220
I'll get her to Japan.

504
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
The ship's waiting.

505
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,700
We can set sail anytime.

506
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,060
Mr. Komura,

507
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,940
if she won't come around,

508
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,180
even if you take her to Japan,

509
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,100
she still won't change her mind.

510
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,260
Then I'll kill her.

511
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,220
What's not ours to claim

512
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,340
won't be yours to take.

513
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,260
She's here.

514
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,740
Chu Shaohua is here.

515
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,860
Once she's inside the East Asia Hotel,

516
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,340
there's no way she's getting out.

517
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,060
She's getting off the rickshaw.

518
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,060
Erniu.

519
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,020
Erniu!

520
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,660
Shaohua!

521
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,980
Shaohua!

522
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,580
Get in the car!

523
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,700
They're catching up!

524
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,020
Quick!

525
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,340
What's wrong with the car?

526
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,420
It fell down.

527
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,500
It's being pulled up.

528
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,620
It is coming up.

529
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,420
When did this happen?

530
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,580
Just now.

531
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,860
What about the people in the car?

532
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,180
Didn't see them come up.

533
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,260
They must be dead.

534
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,900
How can dead people come up?

535
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,300
I'm afraid they didn't make it.

536
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,100
I saw the car go down,

537
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,420
and no one came up.

538
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,140
That's right.

539
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,140
Get out of the car.

540
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,220
Get out!

541
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,820
Mr. Xia.

542
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,580
[In Memory of the Late Ms. Chu Shaohua]

543
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,220
When is Cheng Hui leaving?

544
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,260
We're just waiting on him
to move forward with the factory.

545
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,980
After my funeral,

546
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,380
he will depart.

547
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,340
Neither the Japanese nor the KMT agents

548
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,060
will track or threaten you anymore.

549
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,020
You're safe now.

550
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,220
But he's gone.

551
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,100
He had a secret mission

552
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,860
to keep you safe.

553
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,860
And he fulfilled it brilliantly.

554
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,020
It's just

555
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,540
that he was supposed

556
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,980
to tell you

557
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,020
what really happened

558
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,340
on the day Xia Chu gave his life.

559
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,540
Now,

560
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,220
it falls to me to tell you.

561
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,420
Mr. Wen.

562

has carried such deep guilt
all these years.

that if he had insisted
Xia Chu evacuate,

616
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,380

617

sacrifice his life.

but he remained silent.
