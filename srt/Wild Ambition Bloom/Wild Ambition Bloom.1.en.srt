00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,300
I found Maliu Village 50 li away
through Zhu,

378
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,460
a carter from Tongda Carriage Depot.

379
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,580
There's a courtyard.

380
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,100
The tenant's gone,

381
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,540
but the courtyard

382
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,180
still has alfalfa roots, dyes,

383
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
and tools,

384
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,660
clear proof

385
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,140
it was used to make fake Huangqi.

386
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,460
Your brother faked the goods.

387
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,420
Of course you knew where he did it.

388
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,860
No need to ask a carter
to track it down.

389
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,820
I spoke to the landlord myself.

390
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,540
He said the tenant
was from the northwest.

391
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,940
It wasn't Chu Shaozhong.

392
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,580
What if he hired a north-westerner

393
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,260
to rent it for him?

394
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,100
Fine.

395
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,860
Then, how do you explain this?

396
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,540
What do you mean by this?

397
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,980
I found this in the courtyard.

398
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,660
A sack used for holding fake Huangqi.

399
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,660
Everyone says your sacks

400
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,700
have a secret mark.

401
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,660
It also has one.

402
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,620
At first glance,

403
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,420
it's exactly like your secret mark.

404
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,580
But the details give it away.

405
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,940
Mr. Yang, look.

406
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,580
This sloppy mark

407
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,940
seems to come from the same hand

408
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,460
that forged Tang's.

409
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,740
What's so strange about that?

410
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,340
He was swapping the goods.

411
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,220
Naturally, he'd forge the mark.

412
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,180
To fake the mark,

413
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,500
he had to know

414
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,740
the Guandong Guild stamped their sacks.

415
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,380
Then why didn't he replace the sacks

416
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,940
when he sold the real Huangqi?

417
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,140
Well...

418
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,500
Who would have known?

419
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,020
Mr. Yang,

420
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,460
Shaozhong did buy stolen goods,

421
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,020
but it was an unintentional mistake.

422
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,380
However, if you insist

423
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,340
he is the one who swapped them,

424
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,860
then you're letting
the real culprit walk free.

425
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,980
It's all because of the Huang guy.

426
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,220
If I see him again,

427
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
I won't let him off the hook.

428
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,340
I just hate that my money's gone

429
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,740
for nothing.

430
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,300
Let's just consider it a lesson learned.

431
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,140
From now on,

432
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,100
if something seems too good to be true,

433
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,420
we need to be more careful.

434
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,340
Thankfully, we have Chichun Apothecary.

435
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,460
Let's start small

436
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,940
and make up for the losses first.

437
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,980
Things will keep picking up
for our business.

438
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,020
Shaohua.

439
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,460
There's one more thing
I need to tell you.

440
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,220
Shaozhong!

441
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,140
What are you doing?

442
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,420
Shaozhong!

443
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,220
- What are you doing?
- Shaozhong!

444
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,220
- Shaozhong!
- Shaohua!

445
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,340
Shaohua!

446
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,140
- Don't you move.
- Shaozhong!

447
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,860
Let me go!

448
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,060
What do you think you are doing?

449
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,460
Get your hands off me!

450
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,340
Let go of me!

451
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,940
Get inside!

452
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,220
Stop it!

453
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,900
Shaohua!

454
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,660
Shaozhong!

455
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,140
Shaozhong!

456
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,140
Shaozhong!

457
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,460
Didn't you say

458
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,420
they agreed to release him?

459
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,180
He got snatched by loan sharks.

460
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,900
How did it come to that?

461
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,060
Shaozhong spent 400 silver dollars

462
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,580
on the Huangqi.

463
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,340
Three hundred and sixty dollars
of the money

464
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,100
came from a loan.

465
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,300
Repayment was due in half a month,

466
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,340
with a five li rate.

467
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,140
It's

468
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,180
three days overdue.

469
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,340
By their rules,

470
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,860
three days late, they take a hand.

471
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,100
But don't worry.

472
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,540
I talked to them.

473
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,180
They agreed to give us three more days.

474
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,940
After that,

475
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,300
we have to pay everything:

476
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,220
principal, interest, and a penalty.

477
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,620
A total

478
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,060
of 390 silver dollars.

479
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,100
If we don't,

480
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,420
Shaozhong loses

481
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,700
a hand and a foot.

482
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,660
Then how can he make it?

483
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,700
Three hundred and ninety silver dollars.

484
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,140
The most valuable things we've got

485
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,020
are the land and this house.

486
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,860
I've already been to the broker house

487
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,980
and asked around,
relatives, neighbors, everyone.

488
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,780
All in all,

489
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,620
we should be able to pull together
a bit over 100.

490
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,020
If he can't survive this,

491
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,260
I don't want to either.

492
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,100
Mother,

493
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,700
take out
whatever you've managed to save.

494
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,060
I don't have any money

495
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,580
But you still have some jewelry, right?

496
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,540
Those aren't worth much.

497
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,260
Look.

498
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,940
Isn't that...?

499
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,420
Don't push her.

500
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,460
If she had any money,

501
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
she would've spent it on the family.

502
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,740
Then

503
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,420
what about you?
Don't you have any private savings?

504
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
What do you mean?

505
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,980
Let me see what else can be sold.

506
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,420
Then let's sell Chichun Apothecary.

507
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,740
What?

508
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,540
I heard Shaozhong say

509
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,540
that someone was willing to offer 200

510
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,980
to buy Chichun Apothecary.

511
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,500
We can't sell it.

512
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,740
If we don't, he's as good as dead.

513
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,060
That's our family's legacy
for three generations!

514
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,460
No one's selling it!

515
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
But if he's gone,

516
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,860
what's the point of keeping it?

517
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,060
Let's sell it.

518
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,380
As long as Shaozhong comes back safe,

519
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,140
forget Chichun Apothecary,

520
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,860
sell me if you have to.

521
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,260
I'll sell it!

522
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,140
Take it all!

523
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,220
I'll do it tomorrow.

524
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,060
This is our family's treasure,

525
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,180
the recipe for the Miracle Pill.

526
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,580
I want to learn it.

527
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,140
But I need to tell you this.

528
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,860
A man of honor always keeps striving,
like heaven never stops moving.

529
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,820
Grandpa,

530
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,060
I am a woman, not a man.

531
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,300
To serve the greater good
and live with compassion,

532
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,060
when the heart shines bright,

533
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,100
honor belongs to all.

534
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Grandpa, I want
to be someone honorable too,

535
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,500
to do something that truly matters.

536
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,700
[Chichun Apothecary]
Chichun Apothecary.

537
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,460
Chichun Apothecary.

538
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,460
Mr. Wang.

539
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,860
Thank you.

540
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,860
I'll pay it back soon.

541
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
Don't mention it.

542
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,340
I wish

543
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,780
I could do more.

544
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm truly sorry.

545
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,540
Please don't say that.

546
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,980
Your help means a lot.

547
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,140
We're truly grateful.

548
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,380
Mrs. Chu,

549
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,300
are you home?

550
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,020
Mrs. San.

551
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,060
I'm here

552
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,660
to bring you a message.

553
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,980
My grandson went
to the Medicine Market this morning.

554
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,980
Guess what?

555
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
He met Master Chen.

556
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,980
He asked my grandson
to deliver a message

557
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,140
that he'll bring his eldest son

558
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,380
to visit tomorrow.

559
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,580
The Chen family?

560
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:50,980
Is it

561
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,580
the Chen family that Shaohua is arranged
to be married into?

562
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,500
Who else could it be?

563
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,980
Get prepared.

564
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,420
Make sure they don't show up tomorrow

565
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,220
and find you with nothing ready.

566
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm going home. Got cooking to do.

567
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,460
Understood.

568
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,980
Goodbye, Mrs. San.

569
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,140
She said Master Chen is coming.

570
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,660
Well...

571
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,820
Mother.

572
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,460
There's hope for Shaozhong.

573
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
What do you mean?

574
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,220
Think about it.
They're coming to propose.

575
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,180
They'll have to bring
betrothal gifts, right?.

576
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
That means Shaozhong's going to be okay.

577
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,100
If that's the case,

578
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,460
that would be wonderful.

579
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,580
Definitely.

580
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,100
But

581
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,020
we haven't been in touch

582
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,260
with the Chen family for years.

583
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,740
Shaohua mentioned earlier

584
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,020
they might have something else in mind.

585
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,780
That won't do.

586
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,420
No matter what,

587
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,180
this marriage must be finalized.

588
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,860
- Look how perfect it is.
- It's stunning.

589
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,180
Come on. Be good.

590
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,380
Sit here.

591
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,220
Sit down.

592
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,700
Come on.

593
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,500
Master Chen gave this bracelet

594
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,020
when the engagement was made years ago.

595
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,740
I don't want it.

596
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,220
- No.
- Put it on.

597
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,060
Be a good girl, alright?

598
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,740
Just put it on, okay?

599
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,340
So fitting.

600
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,020
Wear it.

601
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,580
Mother.

602
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,300
Go greet Mr. Chen at the door.

603
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,380
Right.

604
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,220
Let's put on some lipstick.

605
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,020
My goodness, what are you doing?

606
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,340
Don't go against me.

607
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,140
Be a good girl.

608
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,260
Come on.

609
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,980
Don't move.

610
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,860
Mrs. Chu.

611
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
We haven't seen each other
in over ten years, have we?

612
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,220
Indeed.

613
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
I didn't expect you to come so soon.

614
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,620
Since it's a special occasion,

615
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,060
we couldn't wait to come early.

616
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,060
Alright.

617
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,180
Dashun, this is Mrs. Chu.

618
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:35,740
Mrs. Chu.

619
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,900
Good to see you.

620
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,180
Please come in.

621
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,620
Alright.

622
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,100
Please.

623
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:39,980
Let's go.

624
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,700
Come in, please.

625
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,780
Shaohua.

626
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,540
Oh my goodness.

627
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,220
How could they have come so soon?

628
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,380
What are you doing?

629
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,140
They're here.

630
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,300
You can't let him see you
looking like that.

631
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,820
Let me tell you, Chu Shaohua,

632
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,700
you must win Chen Dashun's heart.

633
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,700
Think about Shaozhong's hand and foot.

634
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,540
Did you hear me?

635
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,740
Zhou Yan, come here. Hurry.

636
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:03,820
Go.

637
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,940
Coming.

638
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,180
Hurry up.

639
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
I suppose you're Mr. Chen, right?

640
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,460
This is...?

641
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,380
My daughter-in-law.

642
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,780
Sir,

643
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,220
if I were you,

644
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,180
I'd shop around a bit before paying.

645
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,180
Shaozhong's wife. Glad to meet you.

646
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:21,820
Zhou Yan.

647
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,460
This must be Dashun, right?

648
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Oh my.

649
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,260
So dashing.

650
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,300
Shaohua.

651
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
Meet Dashun and Mr. Chen.

652
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,500
Mr. Chen.

653
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,820
Da...

654
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,540
Dashun.

655
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,220
This is...

656
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,300
- Shaohua.
- Miss Chu.

657
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,220
- Yes.
- Shaohua.

658
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,780
In the blink of an eye, she's grown up.

659
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,900
Allow me.

660
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
Here, I'll take them.

661
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,700
Please come inside, Mr. Chen.

662
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,220
Dashun.

663
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,580
Alright.

664
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,900
Please.

665
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,020
Mr. Chen, please.

666
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,060
- Please.
- Alright.

667
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,820
Mother.

668
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,220
Hurry.

669
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,940
Shaohua, come in.

670
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,500
Please take a seat, Mr. Chen,

671
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,580
Dashun.

672
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,700
Please.

673
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,500
Mrs. Chu,

674
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,940
I should've visited you long ago.

675
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,180
But business has kept us so busy.

676
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,300
Dashun and I

677
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,020
just couldn't get away.

678
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,620
Year after year,

679
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,660
it's been delayed until today.

680
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,660
It's alright, Mr. Chen.

681
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,620
Good things don't happen in a hurry.

682
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,780
Mrs. Chu, we're here today

683
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,580
because of Dashun and Miss Chu.

684
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,340
That's right, Mr. Chen.

685
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,660
Look, they're not

686
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,420
getting any younger.

687
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,380
Time to get things underway.

688
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Well,

689
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,700
you see,

690
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,140
back then, it was just a casual remark

691
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,980
between your father-in-law and me.

692
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,020
A joke, really.

693
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,220
That's right, Mr. Chen.

694
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,860
But you know,

695
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,100
you're well respected

696
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,420
around here.

697
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,780
And my grandpa-in-law,

698
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,020
although I never met him,

699
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,460
was also a well-known figure.

700
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,260
So, whatever

701
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,540
you said,

702
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,940
even if it was a joke,

703
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,820
still carries real weight.

704
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,860
Times have changed,

705
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,820
and young people these days

706
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,620
care more about love than tradition.

707
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,900
What matchmakers say

708
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,860
and what parents decide

709
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,820
don't always hold weight anymore.

710
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,740
Mr. Chen, let me tell you,

711
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,900
Dashun must be satisfied with Shaohua.

712
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,940
Isn't that right?

713
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,380
Are you satisfied, Dashun?

714
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,940
Mother, see?

715
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,020
They're

716
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,580
a destined match.

717
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,860
He is satisfied with Shaohua.

718
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,580
That's right.

719
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,340
Mr. Chen, come on.

720
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,500
Have some tea.

721
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,260
To be honest with you, Mr. Chen,

722
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,580
many people

723
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,140
came here

724
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,340
just to gossip.

725
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,460
They say that back then,

726
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
you came to propose willingly

727
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,100
drawn

728
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,540
by our former prestige.

729
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,780
But now, our family

730
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,060
isn't what it used to be,

731
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,380
while you've grown

732
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,180
more prosperous by the day.

733
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,060
So they say you'll go back on your word.

734
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,900
I was really upset with them

735
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,700
and told them not to talk nonsense.

736
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,740
Mr. Chen is not that kind of person.

737
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,900
Right, Mr. Chen?

738
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,820
Enjoy the tea.

739
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,380
Dashun, have some tea.

740
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,700
Mr. Chen,

741
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,980
how about we settle things today?

742
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,180
Mother, I checked the lunar calendar.

743
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,900
The 18th of the fifth month and the 20th
of the sixth month are perfect.

744
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,140
Mother.

745
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,420
This is serious.

746
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,300
Let's give this
some more thought, Mrs. Chu.

747
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,260
Mr. Chen, you've met Shaohua,

748
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,580
and Dashun couldn't be more willing.

749
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,140
What else is left to discuss,

750
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,020
right?

751
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,780
It's getting late.

752
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,180
Dashun and I

753
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,500
still have some business
to take care of.

754
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Let's wrap it up here

755
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,500
for today.

756
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,140
Wait.

757
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,860
Mr. Chen, the key issue's still hanging.

758
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,460
We'll talk about it next time.

759
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,580
Mrs. Chu,

760
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,300
well,

761
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,220
I'll take my leave.

762
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,980
- Dashun.
- Father.

763
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,700
Let's go.

764
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,780
- Wait.
- Come on.

765
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,700
Mr. Chen.

766
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
Mrs. Chu, we're leaving.

767
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,700
Alright.

768
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,620
But...

769
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,180
Wait, Mr. Chen.

770
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,860
Mother.

771
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,500
Mr. Chen.

772
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,140
Mrs. Chu Junior,

773
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,780
in your condition,
there's no need to see us off.

774
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,020
Mr. Chen.

775
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,140
Please hear me out.

776
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,060
Please, don't trouble yourself.

777
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,660
Mr. Chen.

778
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Please hear me out.

779
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,540
I mean...

780
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,380
- Mr. Chen.
- No need.

781
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,700
You get what I mean.

782
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,500
And I get yours.

783
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,700
Let's

784
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,740
talk over the marriage

785
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,140
another time, alright?

786
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,500
We can't afford to delay!

787
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,980
No, Mr. Chen, I mean,

788
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,500
with Dashun here,

789
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,380
let's make their marriage official.

790
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,580
Mrs. Chu Junior,

791
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,700
didn't you say

792
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,940
good things don't happen in a hurry?

793
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
If it's meant to be finalized,

794
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,620
a couple of days
won't make a difference.

795
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,700
And if it's not going to happen,

796
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,060
then there's even less reason to rush.

797
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,660
Goodbye.

798
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,340
No, wait.

799
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,260
Mr. Chen.

800
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,460
Dashun.

801
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,660
Wait.

802
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,660
Mr. Chen.

803
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,700
Shaohua, see them off!

804
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,820
They're leaving!

805
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,140
Shaohua!

806
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,980
Wait, Mr. Chen.

807
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:34,980
Shaohua!

808
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,420
Chu Shaohua, get out here!

809
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,540
Chu Shaohua!

810
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,620
Yan.

811
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,540
What did they say?

812
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,300
They're calling off the wedding!

813
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,660
They don't want your daughter anymore!

814
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
And Shaozhong is a lost cause!

815
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,340
Chu Shaohua!

816
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,820
How are we supposed to save him now?

817
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,460
Get out here!

818
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,980
Chu Shaohua, they came to our door,

819
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,580
and you locked yourself in.

820
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,580
What do you mean by that?

821
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,540
Not even coming out to greet them?

822
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,980
Are you trying

823
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,980
to ruin this marriage arrangement?

824
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
I don't want to marry Chen Dashun.

825
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,420
If you don't, Shaozhong will die.

826
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,860
They don't want to marry me either.

827
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,220
Wait.

828
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,740
I...

829
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,900
Fine.

830
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,300
If you won't think about Shaozhong,

831
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,220
then at least think
about your own future.

832
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,580
Chu Shaohua, I'm telling you.

833
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,940
With your looks,

834
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,180
landing someone from the Chen family

835
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,740
is already more than lucky.

836
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,980
What kind of airs are you putting on?

837
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,220
Don't tell me
you're never getting married

838
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,900
and just sitting here
eating whatever's left, huh?

839
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,900
I can't believe it.

840
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,140
Shaozhong was so good to you
for nothing.

841
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,060
You ungrateful wretch.

842
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,660
Shaozhong always

843
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,780
had you in mind.

844
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,140
He's in serious trouble right now.

845
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,700
How can you just turn away like this?

846
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,300
Take it

847
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,980
and buy whatever you want.

848
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,780
I don't need that, Shaozhong.

849
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,300
Just take it.

850
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,420
Don't tell Yan.

851
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,740
Are you going to watch him die?

852
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,860
If anything happens to Shaozhong,

853
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,420
what about me and this child

854
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
in my belly?

855
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,260
Mother!

856
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,700
Tell her to be reasonable!

857
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,100
How can she act like this?

858
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
She's too selfish!

859
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,300
Shaohua.

860
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,060
I beg you.

861
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,740
You must help Shaozhong.

862
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,460
He's always been there for you.

863
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,900
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

864
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,420
You must help him!

865
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,820
I beg you!

866
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,540
She...

867
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,460
Father!

868
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,220
The woman
who spotted the fake Huangqi

869
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,460
and helped us avoid

870
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,020
a huge loss

871
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,140
was Shaohua.

872
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,420
Are you sure?

873
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,260
I remember her face.

874
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,380
Later,

875
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,260
send some more thank-you gifts.

876
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,580
Father.

877
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,500
What about our marriage?

878
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,780
Just keep stalling.

879
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,900
If we drag it out for a year,

880
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,820
they'll be the ones backing out.

881
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,500
Shaohua's not bad.

882
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,340
I didn't say she was.

883
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,780
But no matter how good she is,

884
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,780
her family's a problem.

885
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,300
You saw it yourself.

886
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,700
Marrying her

887
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,540
will only bring endless problems.

888
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,420
Walk away now

889
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,900
before it's too late.

890
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,700
How did you get ahead of us?

891
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,260
I took a shortcut through the village.

892
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,980
Miss Chu.

893
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,060
Is there anything else?

894
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,340
Mr. Chen, I came to return this to you.

895
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,580
Let's call off

896
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,180
the engagement.

897
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,780
It was all set.

898
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,980
How can it just be called off like that?

899
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,820
Miss Chu.

900
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,340
Have you thought it through?

901
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,540
Marriage is about compatibility,
family, background, and status.

902
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,740
Look at where you stand

903
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
and where we do.

904
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,980
It's plain to see.

905
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,700
This isn't snobbery.

906
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,180
It's just reality.

907
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,420
Besides,

908
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,340
even if you unwillingly let me
marry into your family,

909
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,780
you'd still hold it against me.

910
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,300
So I'd rather end it now.

911
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,420
What about your mother
and sister-in-law?

912
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,980
I make my own choices.

913
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,060
Even if my father were still alive,

914
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,860
I would handle it this way
if I wanted to.

915
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:04,900
Father.

916
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
I told you so.

917
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,740
She's got real backbone.

918
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,460
Alright.

919
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,740
Since you've thought it through,

920
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,900
I will grant your wish.

921
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,860
Father.

922
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,700
From now on,

923
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,900
you and Dashun

924
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
will go your separate ways.

925
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,420
Father.

926
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,340
That's good.

927
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,220
Mr. Chen, Dashun,

928
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,660
I won't see you off.

929
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,300
You go ahead. I'll be off.

930
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:35,900
Shaohua.

931
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,220
Shaohua.

932
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,020
Shaohua.

933
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,900
Father.

934
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,220
Why would you do that?

935
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:40,980
Father.

936
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,380
Oh, Mr. Chen.

937
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,060
Though the engagement was called off,

938
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,540
if my brother and sister-in-law

939
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,260
find out,

940
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
they'll probably make
unreasonable demands.

941
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,820
You don't need to entertain them.

942
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,180
Just say I ended the engagement.

943
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,980
And that you didn't ask for compensation

944
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,380
is already very generous of you.

945
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,940
If they keep bothering you,

946
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,620
please have someone let me know.

947
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,180
I will find a way myself

948
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,740
to make them drop this idea.

949
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,060
Shaohua,

950
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,140
I can provide some money

951
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,620
to help you a little.

952
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,660
Please don't.

953
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,180
My father blew through all our money

954
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,540
because it came too easily.

955
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,620
My brother got into trouble
because he always thought

956
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,980
good fortune just fell from the sky.

957
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,460
That's why I can't accept help

958
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,420
that I didn't earn.

959
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,420
Father, see?

960
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,180
You've got real backbone.

961
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,700
However...

962
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,140
However what?

963
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,180
Mr. Chen, if you still remember

964
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,140
the friendship you had
with my grandfather

965
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,420
and you're willing to lend me a hand...

966
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,220
could you help me find a job?

967
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,940
You're just a young woman,

968
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
what can you do?

969
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,700
I know how to use an abacus.

970
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,980
I'm good at arithmetic.

971
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,300
I can write.

972
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,260
And I've got basic knowledge
of medicine.

973
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,660
Miss Chu.

974
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,740
About the marriage,

975
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,700
we've decided

976
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,300
to go through with it.

977
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,660
Tell your mother,

978
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,020
The 18th of the sixth month it is.

979
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,540
That day is very auspicious.

980
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:52,860
Mr. Chen.

981
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,340
Maybe you should think it over.

982
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,340
No need.

983
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,700
Go back.

984
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,180
Don't make your mother worry.

985
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,260
Dashun, let's go.

986
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,380
Go back.

987
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,100
I'm glad you made it back.

988
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,220
Well, Mother,

989
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,260
Shaozhong's finally back
after everything.

990
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,900
We should celebrate, don't you think?

991
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,140
Let's go to the market tomorrow
and get some meat.

992
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,980
How much would that cost?

993
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,580
Mother, he could really use
a proper meal.

994
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,260
Mother, I need some meat
to get my strength back.

995
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,420
I lost a lot of blood.

996
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,340
Alright.

997
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,540
Alright.

998
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,420
Shaohua.

999
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,100
It's really late.

1000
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,060
Why are you still up?

1001
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,900
Come with me.

1002
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,140
Where exactly are you going?

1003
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,300
Peking.

1004
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,180
Peking?

1005
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,100
You're always talking

1006
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,620
about how great Peking is.

1007
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,420
Now I get to see it for myself.

1008
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,820
Peking is huge.

1009
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,300
Are you going alone?

1010
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,860
Who else?

1011
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,740
Wu.

1012
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,620
Who is Wu?

1013
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,580
He's from Daxinzhuang.

1014
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,660
He used to work at Shouyuan Apothecary.

1015
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,300
So that day at the Medicine Market

1016
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,860
when you suddenly disappeared,

1017
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,620
you actually went to meet him.

1018
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,220
How long have you two been together?

1019
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,580
A month.

1020
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
Just a month?

1021
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,020
And you're already leaving with him?

1022
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,500
He's good to me.

1023
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,940
No, Erniu, you can't go.

1024
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,460
Why not?

1025
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,300
What if he lets you down?

1026
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,620
Shaohua.

1027
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,020
You're

1028
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,020
the one who's been the kindest to me.

1029
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,380
And then there's Wu.

1030
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,900
I know he won't let me down.

1031
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,820
I still think it is too risky.

1032
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Even so,

1033
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,420
I still want to go.

1034
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,940
Shaohua, you told me

1035
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,060
you were afraid
of being trapped here your whole life.

1036
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,060
Actually, I'm scared too.

1037
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,380
If I stay here any longer,

1038
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,260
my father will beat me to death.

1039
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,020
Or worse, he'll sell me off

1040
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,340
to be some old man's concubine.

1041
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,500
Going with Wu

1042
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,500
is my only chance to get out.

1043
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,420
I'm leaving.

1044
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,900
Erniu.

1045
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,300
- The groom is here!
- The groom is here!

1046
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:32,820
- The groom is here!
- The groom is here!

1047
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,180
Miss.

1048
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,940
How much is the fee?

1049
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,780
Are you bandits or rebels?

1050
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
We are not bandits.

1051
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,820
Shaohua,

1052
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,380
with your intelligence and courage,

1053
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,980
you'll achieve great things

1054
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,500
as long as you're willing
to take the first step.

1055
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,140
When I come back,

1056
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,860
I'll take you to see the world outside,

1057
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,340
okay?

1058
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,580
Okay.

1059
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,620
It's a promise.

1060
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,500
You have my word.

1061
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,620
