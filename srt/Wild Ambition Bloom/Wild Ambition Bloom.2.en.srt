I need it right now.

Two joys in one day.

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,940

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,260
How about doubling the reward?

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,500
Of course.

Okay, madam.

49
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,900

footing the bill.

Instead, you're just standing here,
bossing people around.

65

- Alright.
- Let us take a look!

- One look.

91
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,860

- Remove it.
- Hurry up.

- Go out.
- Come on, man, we're brothers!

104
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,300
Sorry.

105
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,660
We only got a glimpse.

106
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,020

You probably won't believe this,

111
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,380
but ever since I saw you
at the Qizhou Medicine Market,

112
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,540
I've been waiting for this day.

113
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,740

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,260

You were the buyer.

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes.

119
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,180
I really regretted it,

120
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,540
forgetting

121
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,780
to ask your name

122
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,260
or where you lived.

123
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
I thought I'd never see you again.

124
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,660
But I never imagined

125
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,420
you'd be the one I was betrothed to.

126
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,660
I didn't expect it either.

127
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,180
Don't be afraid.

128
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,220
Rest assured.

129
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,540
I'll be good to you, always.

Get out, all of you!

135
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,780
Let us have a look!

136
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,500
Cut it out.

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,140
Just one look.

138
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,060
All of you, get out!

139
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,860
Go ogle your own wives at home!

140
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:21,980
What, never seen a woman before?

141
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
So stingy!

142
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,860
Out you go!

143
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
I can't believe it.

144
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,060
Lift it up yourself.

145
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,900
It's not like we haven't met before.

146
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
Ershun.

147
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,020
What does your mother mean?

148
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,420
Such a tiny dowry?

149
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,260
If she doesn't want this marriage,
then just say so.

150

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,300
I mean mine.

153
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,940
You've always put yourself first,
haven't you?

154
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,780
Take a moment and reflect.

155
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,300
Did you sleep well last night?

156
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,580
Why didn't you wake me up?

157
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,580
You looked so peaceful.

158
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
I couldn't bring myself to wake you.

159
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,380
Do you want some tea?

160
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,540
Do you know what time it is?

161
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,460
How could you keep
your father-in-law waiting?

162
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,420
Never mind.

163
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,180
It's her first day

164
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,900
in our family, after all.

165
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Yes, Darling.

166
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,660
Day one and already like this?

167
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,900
What kind of days
are we going to have ahead?

Shaohua.

169
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,060
Back at your parents' home,

170
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,340
you could throw tantrums

171
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,580
and slack off all you wanted.

172
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,820
But here, in our family, that won't fly.

173
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,260
At least Ershun's wife has some sense.

174
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,020
We only arrived

a moment before they did.

176
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,140
Mother.

177
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,700
It's my fault.

178
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,180
Shaohua got up early.

179
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,540
I was the one who held her back.

180
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,340
Last night I drank too much.

181
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,140
When I woke up this morning,
my head hurt a lot.

182
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,140
So I asked her to massage me.

183
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
And as a result,

184
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,540
we were delayed.

185
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,100
Alright, Shaohua,

186
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Ping, let's go.

187
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,900
Help me up.

188
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,660
Follow me to the kitchen.

189
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,980
No need. Shaohua,

190
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,500
Ping, let's go.

191
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,700
From now on,

192
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,300
all the food and drink

193
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,100
for the family

194
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,860
will be managed by the two of you.

195
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,020
One person a day works too.

196
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,220
So,

197
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
who'd like to start today?

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,180
Me.

199
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,340
How about you, Shaohua?

200
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,460
Alright, Mother.

201
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Then hurry

202
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,820
and make breakfast.

203
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,180
Mother,

204
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,780
Ping and I just joined the family.

205
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,100
What are the rules for meals here?

206
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,660
So, what do you and Father like to eat?

207
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,980
We'd love some tips from you.

208
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,740
Didn't you eat breakfast
at your parents' place?

209
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,380
But...

210
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,580
It's all the same.

211
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,540
Don't just stand there.

212
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,180
Start the firewood.

213
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,900
Put on an apron.

214
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,380
Shaohua.

215
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,860
Go outside and get a bundle of firewood.

216
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,460
Mother, you just said
to start this firewood.

217
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,380
Isn't there some already?

218
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,300
Just do as I say.

219
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,420
Take it.

220
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,700
Let's go.

221
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,100
Hurry up.

222
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,820
Darling.

223
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,300
Shaohua made the breakfast

224
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,140
by herself.

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,980
Let's see how she did.

226
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,940
How is it, Darling?

227
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,540
What's wrong?

228
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,780
Did you drop the whole salt jar in?

229
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,980
Don't go upsetting your father-in-law

230
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,220
first thing in the morning.

231
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,140
Once is enough,

232
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
but don't make it a habit.

233
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Mother, Father.

234
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,780
This is my fault.

235
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,860
I forgot to tell Shaohua

236
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,580
that Father

237
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,140
eats a sweet breakfast

238
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,420
every morning.

239
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,580
It slipped my mind.

240
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,580
Father, I didn't get a chance
to tell you

241
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I made something sweet just for you.

242
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,020
There's more?

243
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,580
Yes, I'll go get it for you.

244
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,260
Did you hear that?

245
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,260
There are sweet ones too?

246
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,140
Here, Father.

247
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,060
Look.

248
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,980
Pumpkin cakes.

249
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Fruit porridge.

250
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,300
Sweet rice wine dumplings.

251
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,900
Yam and red bean paste.

252
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,780
They're all for you.

253
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,900
All sweet.

254
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,820
This is delicious.

255
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,100
Shaohua.

256
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,020
The porridge cooked with fruit.

257
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,020
Never had that before.

258
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,380
I drank way too much last night.

259
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,780
I've been feeling off.

260
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,180
But the moment

261
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,980
these sweet rice wine dumplings
went down,

262
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,220
I felt instantly better.

263
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,780
That's impressive.

264
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,580
As long as you're comfortable, Darling.

265
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,940
Dig in.

266
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm really impressed.

267
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,340
Here, take this.

268
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,900
Where did you get the sugar?

269
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,500
That's odd.

270
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,740
I couldn't find any

271
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,980
in the kitchen.

272
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,500
With so many people around yesterday,

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,540
maybe someone took it.

274
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,260
Yeah, that must be it.

275
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,220
Shaohua,

276
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,980
you really are good at cooking.

277
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,340
As long as you like it.

278
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,100
It's delicious, right?

279
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,700
Yes.

280
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,700
Delicious.

281
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,140
She's into food, so she's keen to cook.

282
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,660
I wouldn't be surprised

283
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,540
if your family went broke
just feeding you.

284
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,980
Father, please try this red bean paste.

285
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,020
I added Chenpi.

286
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,580
This enhances the flavor
and helps digestion.

287
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,140
Excellent.

288
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Why did you hit her?
That gave me a fright.

289
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,340
This was made for Father.

290
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,540
I've been hesitating for ages
and still haven't touched it.

291
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,820
You think you deserve that?

292
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,820
You eat all that
and still don't gain a thing.

293
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,860
That's food down the drain.

294
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,460
It's fine, there's more in the kitchen.

295
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,140
I'll go get some more if you want.

296
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,580
Shaohua, don't fuss.

297
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,140
Just enjoy the meal.

298
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,780
So the chef

299
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,820
Wei vouched for

300
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,580
has got sticky fingers.

301
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,700
Seriously? Stealing sugar?

302
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,580
That sugar thief's days

303
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,140
are probably numbered.

304
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,900
Why?

305
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,540
Ever heard

306
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,660
it's safer to steal gold than sugar?

307
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,980
Steal gold, and you go to jail.

308
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,620
Steal sugar, and you don't live
to tell the tale.

309
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,100
Why?

310
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,540
Sugar

311
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,300
soaks up a family's bad vibes.

312
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,860
Steal it,

313
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,700
and you inherit

314
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,140
all their curses.

315
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,780
Honestly, how long
can someone survive that?

316
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
Really?

317
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,980
Mother, remember Shuanzhu?

318
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,140
The guy who died ten years ago,
bleeding from every opening.

319
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
No one ever figured out why.

320
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,740
But word is,

321
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,860
he stole sugar

322
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,220
from Mrs. Liu's place
right before he died.

323
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,420
What's wrong with her?

324
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,740
Go check on her.

325
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,380
Ershun.

326
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,660
What's wrong with her?

327
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Well... You...

328
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,100
Shaohua.

329
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,940
Shaohua.

330
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,100
Is everything

331
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,900
you just said true?

332
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,300
I only heard it from others,

333
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,580
so don't take it too seriously.

334
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,820
Where are your manners?

335
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
Father and Mother are still inside.

336
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,660
What are you holding?

337
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:20,860
Give it to me.

338
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,660
So you're the one who stole the sugar.

339
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,620
I didn't.

340
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,820
So you came here

341
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,980
not just to freeload, but to steal?

342
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
We gave your family 40 silver dollars
as the bride price,

343
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,100
and you still can't afford sugar?

344
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,420
I didn't steal it.

345
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,980
Mother gave it to me.

346
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,900
Song Ping,

347
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,220
don't talk nonsense.

348
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
You're really asking for a slap!

349
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,380
Stop!

350
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,500
You're the one who deserves a slap.

351
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,820
All of you, get back to your rooms!

352
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,660
I...

353
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,620
I didn't steal it.

354
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,660
Father, don't be upset.

355
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,780
Darling.

356
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,500
Darling.

357
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,180
Hey, I'm not that scary, am I?

358
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,820
Stop it.

359
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,420
Why are you crying?

360
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
Ershun

361
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,940
must have been drinking again.

362
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,300
Stop crying!

363
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,980
Why don't you

364
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,220
go calm him down?

365
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,260
Hold it back!

366
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,460
They

367
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,060
have only been married a few days,

368
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,060
and he's already hitting her.

369
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,580
If the neighbors hear it,

370
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,340
what do you think they'll say?

371
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,020
Indeed.

372
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,380
But Ershun's wife deserves a beating.

373
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,580
She just got here,

374
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,020
and she's already wrecked a pot

375
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
and smashed three bowls,

376
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,940
including my gold-rimmed porcelain.

377
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,540
Today she knocked over a bottle of oil,

378
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
at least half a jin,

379
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,780
all over the floor.

380
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,020
Well, you

381
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,500
picked her,

382
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,700
your niece,
from your side of the family!

383
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,420
I did,

384
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,900
but I didn't know

385
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,100
she was this clumsy.

386
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,300
Next time he lays a hand on you,

387
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,900
hit him back.

388
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
I'm not his match.

389
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,180
Then you can at least use a knife.

390
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
I wouldn't dare.

391
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,780
Then run.

392
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
Where would I run?

393
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,820
To my room.

394
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,500
You...

395
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,260
Weren't you determined
to get the upper hand on me?

396
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,740
Who said that?

397
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,260
Mother said so.

398
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,260
Song Ping,

399
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,940
we didn't know each other before,

400
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,860
but we joined the family
on the same day.

401
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,460
We're practically sisters.

402
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,700
The most important things
between sisters

403
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,420
are mutual respect, love

404
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,300
and taking care of each other.

405
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,300
There's no need for anyone
to get the upper hand.

406
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,300
Understand?

407
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,420
Okay.

408
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,260
Go back.

409
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,180
I just talked to him.

410
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Thank you, Dashun.

411
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,140
Thank you, Shaohua.

412
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,780
These pastries were prepared

413
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,500
by your father and me,

414
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,260
one share for each of you,

415
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,540
all equal.

416
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,460
Take them home for your families to try.

417
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,460
It's a small token of our goodwill.

418
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,580
Thank you, Mother.

419
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
Shaohua, here.

420
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,140
This is for you.

421
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,860
Aren't they all the same?

422
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,100
Thank you.

423
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Take it.

424
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,420
Alright.

425
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,180
Try to be back soon, okay?

426
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,740
Father, Mother.

427
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,300
Then we'll be leaving.

428
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,620
Say hello to everyone at home.

429
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,980
Thank you, Father.

430
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,780
Father, we're going to Songjiazhuang.

431
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,500
Father,

432
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,260
Mother, we're leaving.

433
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,780
Father, Mother, we're off.

434
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,820
What's inside?

435
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,580
Open it.

436
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,900
"May luck keep coming your way."

437
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,780
Why did you

438
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,940
give me this one?

439
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
You said

440
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
we should respect and love one another.

441
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,860
You're my sister-in-law. Of course,
I should let you have it first.

442
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,500
Is that so?

443
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,820
Stop with those tricks.

444
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,900
She comes from a poor family.

445
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,140
Giving her nice things is a waste.

446
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,540
And yours?

447
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,060
That dowry was a joke.

448
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,540
I'm ashamed to even mention it.

449
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,100
Mother.

450
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,220
Where's Shaozhong?

451
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,780
He's gone to buy seeds

452
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,900
and will be back soon.

453
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,500
Seeds?

454
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,500
We don't even have land anymore.

455
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,860
So what's he doing buying seeds?

456
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,540
Don't you know?

457
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,580
Dashun helped

458
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,020
redeem the land

459
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,740
your brother pawned.

460
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,660
Dashun, have some water.

461
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,420
- Okay.
- Have a seat.

462
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:54,980
Thank you, Yan.

463
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,500
Shaohua.

464
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,700
Dashun and Shaohua, welcome back.

465
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,100
Shaozhong.

466
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,380
Shaozhong, you're back.

467
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,540
When did you get here?

468
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,540
Just now.

469
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,460
Have a seat.

470
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,140
Okay.

471
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,820
The journey was smooth, right?

472
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,860
Yeah.

473
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,140
That's good.

474
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,660
Dashun.

475
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,860
I heard your family's business

476
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,020
is really taking off.

477
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,460
Just a small business.

478
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh, please.

479
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,340
You call that small?

480
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,900
Just a slice of it

481
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,540
would feed us for a year.

482
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,740
Dashun,

483
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,540
you haven't told Mother

484
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,180
where these pastries came from, right?

485
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,940
Go ahead.

486
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,980
Right, Mother.

487
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,060
These pastries were for you.

488
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,820
Zhengming Pastry House

489
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,740
used to make pastries for the royals.

490
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,300
Dashun.

491
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,460
So I heard your family struck a deal

492
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,220
with the Hankou medicine traders, right?

493
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,340
Mother, try this sachima.

494
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,900
- It looks so good!
- Yes.

495
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,580
Shaozhong, that's right.

496
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,620
So, do you think
we could join in as shareholders?

497
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,940
Indeed.

498
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:00,900
Do you like it?

499
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,460
We can talk about that.

500
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,500
Honestly,

501
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,140
I'd like to go with you

502
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,740
so I can learn

503
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,420
how to do business
with those from Hubei.

504
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,380
That's right.

505
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,780
How much

506
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,460
are you planning to invest?

507
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,660
I was thinking...

508
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,940
Well.

509
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,780
Dashun,

510
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,740
Shaozhong

511
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,260
was framed before,

512
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,060
and it caused huge losses.

513
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,340
Then came Shaohua's wedding,

514
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,460
which completely drained our savings.

515
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,260
So right now,

516
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,140
we can't raise any ready cash.

517
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,740
But we were wondering,

518
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,300
Dashun,

519
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,580
could you front the capital for us?

520
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,380
Once we start making money,
we'll pay you back in full.

521
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,620
I don't think that makes sense.

522
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,780
You're asking him to take you along,

523
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,380
and also asking him
to advance the capital.

524
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,420
What do you take him for?

525
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,820
Well...

526
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,540
Shaohua.

527
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,620
Dashun didn't say anything, did he?

528
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,300
Right.

529
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,500
As the saying goes,

530
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
live within your means.

531
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,420
If you don't have the capital,

532
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,940
it's better not to get into business.

533
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,820
Shaohua, listen to yourself.

534
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Sure, we don't have money,

535
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,060
but you're our family, aren't you?

536
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,420
I am, but you still can't
scheme like that?

537
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,860
No, I...

538
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,340
How is this scheming?

539
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,180
How is that not...?

540
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
It's fine.

541
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,420
It means they see me

542
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,580
as family.

543
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,340
It's okay.

544
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,740
So generous of you,

545
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,220
Dashun.

546
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm telling the truth.

547
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,780
You guys carry on.

548
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,140
I'll make some hot water for everyone.

549
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,220
Shaohua.

550
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,060
Can you lend me a hand?

551
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,060
Mother.

552
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,620
Come on.

553
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,740
Let me be clear

554
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,180
on this.

555
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,380
No way.

556
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,100
How much did you just give Shaozhong?

557
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,460
Six silver dollars.

558
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,220
Why did you

559
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,620
give him so much money?

560
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,660
He is your brother, after all.

561
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,420
Why didn't you tell me

562
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,180
you helped my family

563
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,980
redeem the land?

564
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,140
Isn't that what I should do?

565
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,260
What's there to say?

566
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,500
How much did that cost?

567
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,500
Not much.

568
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,180
Dashun.

569
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,180
Why are you so good to my family?

570
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
I thought

571
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,740
if your family was struggling,

572
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,140
you wouldn't be happy.

573
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,380
If they're doing okay,

574
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,780
you'll be in a better mood too.

575
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,580
Thank you.

576
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,540
No need to be so formal.

577
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,500
We're all family.

578
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,540
Oh, right.

579
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,980
Don't get involved

580
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,660
in his capital nonsense.

581
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,820
Since he has asked,

582
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,220
I should help if I can.

583
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,300
That's not how it works.

584
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,660
Luo, there are bandits.

585
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,500
Hurry.

586
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,060
Okay!

587
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,300
Luo, be quick!

588
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,820
Faster!

589
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,380
Okay!

590
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Faster.

591
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,180
Hurry, Luo!

592
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,620
What are you looking at?

593
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,540
Get out of the carriage. Robbery.

594
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,540
Please don't shoot.

595
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,180
Sir, I'm just a carriage driver.

596
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,140
I've got no money at all.

597
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,620
What a poor wretch.

598
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,860
Dashun.

599
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,420
Buddy.

600
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,500
Take

601
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,060
anything of value.

602
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,500
Just please

603
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,900
don't hurt my wife.

604
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,100
That depends on how much money
you give me.

605
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,260
You can have everything.

606
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,500
That's all?

607
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Yes.

608
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,300
Don't move.

609
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,220
What about yours?

610
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,620
We are robbers, not beggars.

611
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,460
You have no respect for bandits.

612
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,100
Nothing else?

613
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,460
That's all.

614
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,180
Really.

615
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,900
Go ahead and search me, if that helps.

616
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,420
That's all I've got.

617
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,260
Alright.

618
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,940
Scarface.

619
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,300
She's in your hands.

620
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,740
Thanks, buddy.

621
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,620
Didn't we say

622
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
you'd stay away from my wife?

623
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,540
Buddy.

624
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,300
Pretty.

625
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,780
Let me take good care of you.

626
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,420
Don't move!

627
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,500
Darn you!

628
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,140
Dashun.

629
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,420
Don't touch my wife!

630
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,820
Dashun!

631
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,060
Dashun!

632
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,020
Dashun, stop!

633
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,980
Don't touch my wife!

634
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,860
Dashun!

635
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,060
Don't move!

636
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,820
Dashun!

637
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,180
Stop!

638
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,580
Shaohua, run!

639
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,220
Dashun!

640
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,100
Stop! Don't hit him!

641
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,300
Enough! Dashun!

642
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,900
Stop!

643
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,820
Don't move!

644
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,460
Let go of my man!

645
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,580
Don't move!

646
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,220
Tell them to drop their guns.

647
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,180
Put down your guns.

648
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,380
I said, drop them!

649
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,980
Luo.

650
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,100
Help Dashun into the carriage.

651
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,100
Okay.

652
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,660
Come on, Young Master.

653
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,900
Quick. Let's go.

654
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,500
Come on.

655
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:49,980
Don't move.

656
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,900
He's fine.

657
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,740
Shut up!

658
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,460
Young Master, get in.

659
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,260
Tell your men to let all the horses go.

660
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,060
Do it!

661
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,620
Release the horses.

662
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,980
Let them go!

663
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,420
Now!

664
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,580
You, get in the carriage.

665
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,140
Get in!

666
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,540
Scram!

667
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,660
Stop aiming at me.

668
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,100
Luo, go.

669
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,100
Dashun, hold on.

670
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,500
We're almost home!

671
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,900
Luo, hurry!

672
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,580
Okay!

673
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,380
Darling.

674
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,260
Sir, careful.

675
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,700
Dashun, what happened?

676
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,340
Dashun.

677
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
What happened?

678
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,820
How did it come to this?

679
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
- Shaohua.
- Careful.

680
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,660
- Easy.
- Shaohua?

681
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,460
I'm fine.

682
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,140
Shaohua.

683
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,260
What happened?

684
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,020
Help her.

685
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
- Hurry.
- Darling.

686
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,860
Quick.

687
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:09,940
Take it easy.

688
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,420
May the Bodhisattvas bless Dashun.

689
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,060
May the Bodhisattvas bless him.
Amitābha!

690
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,420
Dashun isn't going to die, is he?

691
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,740
Are you itching for a beating, huh?

692
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,260
Stop shouting.

693
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,700
Darling.

694
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,500
How is he?

695
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Don't worry. He's much better.

696
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,700
He woke up and said a few words to me.

697
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,020
Now he's fallen asleep again.

698
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,860
Physician Wang, thanks.

699
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,300
How is he?

700
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,380
Although

701
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,380
his injuries are serious,

702
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,980
his life is not in danger.

703
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,340
With adherence to my prescription

704
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,940
and proper rest,

705
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,020
I'm confident
he will make a full recovery.

706
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,740
Physician Wang, thank you.

707
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
- Thank you.
- Much appreciated.

708
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,740
- Then I'll take my leave.
- Thank you.

709
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,740
See Physician Wang out.

710
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,540
Please.

711
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,340
What exactly happened

712
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,620
to him?

713
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,540
They encountered
the Sanshou Gang on the way back.

714
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,860
The Sanshou Gang?

715
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,540
That's right.

716
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,020
They met them and managed to escape?

717
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,460
Dashun said,

718
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,700
fortunately, Shaohua remained calm

719
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,100
and held the bandit leader hostage.

720
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,420
That's how they got away.

721
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,780
Otherwise,
they wouldn't have made it out.

722
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,380
She even held the bandit leader hostage?

723
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,140
So brave.

724
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,140
She's incredibly fearless and sharp.

725
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
You're still praising her?

726
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,860
If she hadn't insisted on going back,

727
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,860
Dashun wouldn't be suffering like this.

728
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,100
Listen,

729
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,220
if it weren't for her,

730
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,860
your son

731
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,420
would be long gone, you know?

732
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,740
Shaohua scared off the bandits?

733
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
I should smack you

734
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,780
for saying that.

735
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,020
You think we can mess
with the Sanshou Gang?

736
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,380
If they come after us,

737
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,420
we won't know peace again.

738
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,860
Then what do we do?

739
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,420
What else can we do?

740
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,340
Listen.

741
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,060
No one can know about this.

742
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,700
Got it?

743
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
Especially you.

744
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,820
Understood, Father.

745
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,220
Where's the coachman?

746
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,380
Waiting at the door.

747
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,540
Go take care of it.

748
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,500
What are you waiting for?

749
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,300
Okay.

750
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,660
Alright, he's okay.

751
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,380
Let's go.

752
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,700
Shaohua.

753
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,660
Run.

754
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,820
Hurry.

755
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,260
Dashun.

756
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,180
It's alright.

757
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,620
We made it out.

758
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,860
We've escaped.

759
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,740
We're safe.

760
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,540
Any whispers on the street?

761
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,660
No, Father.

762
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,300
I gave Luo three silver dollars

763
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,340
and made it clear how serious this is.

764
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,500
He swore

765
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,620
he wouldn't breathe a word

766
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,980
about Dashun and Shaohua
running into those bandits.

767
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,140
I suppose

768
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,340
we'll leave on the eighth day
of the month.

769
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,700
Tell your mother to start packing.

770
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,540
When I get to Peking,

771
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,660
I'll work hard, make money,

772
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,540
and buy you everything you want.

773
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,900
You'd really give me all I want?

774
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,140
Of course.

775
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,420
Anything

776
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,300
under the sun,

777
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,020
if you want it,

778
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,340
I'll make it happen.

779
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,740
What if I told you
I wanted to leave this place

780
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,180
to see what's out there?

781
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
What's out there?

782
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,220
Don't you want rogue, powders,

783
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,260
silk and jewelry?

784
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,780
I want to do something that matters.

785
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,140
Like what?

786
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,180
The kind of things men get to do.

787
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,980
I want to make something of myself.

788
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,180
Dashun.

789
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,060
How are you feeling?

790
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,180
I'm fine.

791
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,980
Fine? You're nowhere near recovered.

792
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,060
Father.

793
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,420
Once we get to Peking,

794
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,740
things are going to get busy.

795
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,740
I'm worried my injuries

796
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,180
might hold me back
with some of the work.

797
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,340
So, do you think

798
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,660
Shaohua could come with us?

799
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,860
What can she even do?

800
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,020
Plenty.

801
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,300
First off, Father and I

802
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,860
would have someone
we trust to look after us.

803
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,820
And second,

804
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,500
back when we were busy running the shop,

805
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,180
things like laundry, cleaning,

806
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,500
and cooking for the staff

807
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,540
were all handled by the landlady.

808
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,220
If Shaohua comes with us,

809
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,860
we'd save a ton.

810
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,420
No.

811
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,140
She hasn't learned
how things work in our family.

812
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,260
Taking her to Peking

813
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,860
would only cause trouble.

814
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,500
If not,

815
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,700
then we all go together.

816
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,620
Everyone?

817
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,060
That would be such a huge expense.

818
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,420
I've been planning

819
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,380
for us to move to Peking anyway.

820
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,620
Doing it now just makes sense.

821
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,700
It's the perfect chance

822
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,580
to lay low for a while.

823
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,540
Why?

824
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,420
Seriously?

825
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,780
The Sanshou Gang took such a bad fall

826
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,900
because of Dashun and Shaohua.

827
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,220
You think they'll just let it go?

828
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,140
Then what can we do?

829
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,300
Things seem calm for now, sure.

830
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,460
But walls have ears.

831
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,740
If those bandits catch wind of anything

832
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,380
and come knocking,

833
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,660
by then,

834
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,980
it'll be too late

835
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,260
to run.

836
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,300
That's true.

837
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,340
Then let's go.

838
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,780
All of us.

839
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,820
We leave together.

840
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,940
What, now?

841
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,980
Done with your food already?

842
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Rush it, and we'll tip them off.

843
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,620
We've got to stay calm.

844
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,500
Shaohua, are you going out?

845
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,180
Where are you going?

846
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,340

Don't say anything.

901
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,900

902
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,580

Look who finally decided to show up.

906
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,140
Mother, Father.

907
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,300
We wronged Shaohua.

908
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,700
She didn't go back to her family.

909
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,580
She was running an errand for me.

910
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,140
You asked me to check the accounts,

911
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,060
and I found something off

912
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,500
at Baoshu Hall.

913
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,140
But I couldn't go myself.

914
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,300
My legs weren't up to it.

915
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,420
So I asked Shaohua

916
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,380
to go in my place.

917
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,580
You'd better not lie.

918
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,380
No, I'm not.

919
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,060
Earlier, I asked where she went,

920
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,740
and you said you didn't know.

921
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,340
I got flustered this morning

922
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,860
and completely forgot that.

923
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,140
It wasn't until Shaohua came back

924
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,060
with the receipt from Baoshu Hall

925
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,420
that I remembered.

926
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,900
Father, check this out.

927
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,380
So it's true.

928
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,980
Okay, I got it.

929
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,700

930
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,380

931
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,780

932
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,340
that's it?

933
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,700
Go ask Ershun

934
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,500
if the carriage has been arranged.

935
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,860
What are you waiting for? Go, now.

936
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,540
Father,

937
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,420
we'll go pack things up.

938
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,100
Dashun, wait a moment.

939
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,860
Shaohua, go ahead.

943
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,500
You made it?

944
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,700
I followed your recipe.

945
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,460
Not sure if it tastes the way it should.

946
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,420
Sit down.

947
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,300

948
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,300
get along.

00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,500
But remember, everything needs balance.

950
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,220
Overdo it, and it turns sour,

951
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,860
you understand?

952
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,700
Yes.

953
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,900
Shaohua is capable.

954
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,660
That's exactly

955
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,220
why I chose her back then.

956
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,340
But a capable woman

957
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,220
often has a strong personality.

958
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,300
Loving your wife

959
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,460
is your role.

960
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,660
But controlling her

961
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,820
is your skill.
