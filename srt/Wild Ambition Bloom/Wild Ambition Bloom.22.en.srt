00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,780
But she'd rather die
than give in to him.

189
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,820
So he sent a gang of thugs

190
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,220
to assault her.

191
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,420
Humiliated and devastated,

192
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,980
she took her own life on the spot.

193
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Everyone just figured

194
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,780
it was the work of some street thugs,

195
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,220
but the real mastermind

196
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
was actually Wang Guodong.

197
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,060
Is there really no one
who can take him down?

198
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,820
There are people who could,

199
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,020
but right now, they just don't have
the guts or the will.

200
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,220
Shaohua,

201
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,540
don't worry.

202
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,860
Even if he has blocked all routes,

203
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,340
Mu still has a way.

204
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,900
The boat and car are ready

205
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,580
and will depart in thirty minutes.

206
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,300
As long as you leave Shanghai,

207
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,260
you'll be safe.

208
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,260
Yes.

209
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,220
Get to the Northwest

210
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,540
after leaving Shanghai,

211
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,060
and you'll be out of danger.

212
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,020
Don't hesitate. Let's go.

213
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,340
No.

214
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,460
I won't run away.

215
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,460
If you stay any longer,
you won't get another chance.

216
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,700
I've worked so hard
to build something here in Shanghai.

217
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,700
If I walk away now,

218
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,860
I'll be left with nothing.

219
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,820
Shaohua, where there is life,

220
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,020
there is hope.

221
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,860
If I run,

222
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,780
not only will he
go after Wen's Pharmacy

223
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,660
and Mr. Wen,

224
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,140
but he'll drag you, Mu,

225
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,060
and even Mr. Xia

226
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,340
into it.

227
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,380
Don't worry about us.

228
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,100
We can take care of ourselves.

229
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,300
We have plenty of options.

230
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,300
Just get out of here.

231
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,860
At least lay low for a while, okay?

232
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,460
Running away from problems
is not my style.

233
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,740
If innocent people
get dragged into this,

234
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,060
it goes against everything I stand for.

235
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,780
That's why I won't run. No matter what.

236
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,820
He made it clear

237
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,220
that only you're invited.

238
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
It's a trap.

239
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,340
Since they've set the stage,

240
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,500
we'll play along.

241
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,860
Play along? With what plan?

242
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll go in your place.

243
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,580
What for?

244
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,660
To marry him.

245
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,900
- Zhiqiu.
- You're insane.

246
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,940
Don't let anger do the talking.

247
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,740
Worst case, we'll die together.

248
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,300
Why?

249
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,900
He's a scumbag.

250
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,620
He's not worth risking our lives for.

251
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
Shaohua, do you

252
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,460
have another idea?

253
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
I think

254
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,380
we can add fuel to the fire,

255
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,580
and then pull the rug out
from under him.

256
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,060
You're heading straight into danger.

257
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

258
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,980
If we can

259
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,660
get what we want,

260
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,500
then it's worth the risk.

261
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,140
Exactly.

262
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,860
So it's decided.

263
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm not running,

264
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,580
and I won't let him humiliate me.

265
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,340
And we can't just abandon our goods

266
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,540
or put up with
these baseless accusations.

267
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,500
And we should let that scumbag

268
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,460
face the end on his own.

269
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,100
You're really going, aren't you?

270
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes.

271
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,940
Make her ugly.

272
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,940
I'll try my best to make you look
as bad as possible,

273
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,060
so Wang Guodong will despise you.

274
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,260
Hopefully, he'll give up on you.

275
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,780
No.

276
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,660
Use everything you've got

277
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,380
and make me look my absolute best.

278
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,820
Almost there.

279
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,620
Shaohua,

280
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,060
it's still not too late
if you change your mind now.

281
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,620
Don't worry.

282
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,340
It's a trap, sure.

283
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,500
But I know how to flip the board.

284
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,820
I'll walk out with the last laugh.

285
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,700
Even so,

286
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,420
I'm still worried about you.

287
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,020
I promise

288
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,940
I'll come back safe and sound.

289
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,780
Just be extra careful.

290
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,180
I'm leaving.

291
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,420
The big shot and I
have come to an understanding,

292
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,500
but he's still weighing his options.

293
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm hoping

294
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
tonight won't be for nothing.

295
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,260
I believe in you.

296
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,860
Everything's ready?

297
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,940
All set.

298
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,340
What are you doing?

299
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,100
You know how to shoot?

300
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,020
Let him go!

301
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,780
Yes.

302
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,780
Have you ever killed someone?

303
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,740
I don't think...

304
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,220
I'll need this.

305
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,180
Keep it ready, just in case.

306
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,700
If things get risky,

307
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,340
I'll smash a window.

308
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,820
We've got people stationed all around.

309
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,260
Break a window,

310
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,460
and the power will cut
within five seconds.

311
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,340
The back door will go up in flames.

312
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,420
Then will come the gunshots.

313
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,420
Then the phone will ring.

314
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,700
It will say Jufeng Trading Corporation
is being robbed

315
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,620
and needs backup.

316
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,500
By then, Wang's mansion
will be in chaos.

317
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,940
That's when I'll slip out

318
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,900
while everyone's distracted.

319
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,340
Or I can rush in
through the front door to save you.

320
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,460
Alone,

321
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,780
armed, and charging in?

322
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
That's suicide.

323
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,460
Aren't we partners?

324
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,180
Even if I can't save you,
at least we'll go down together.

325
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,300
How romantic.

326
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Wen Zhiqiu,

327
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,580
you know what's scarier than death?

328
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,100
No.

329
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,580
Dying with you.

330
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,580
Alright, that's enough.

331
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,180
Let's go.

332
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm off.

333
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,100
Do you have an invitation?

334
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,060
Go in.

335
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,460
Miss Chu.

336
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,780
Standard procedure.

337
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,620
I'm a guest, not a prisoner.

338
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,860
Miss Chu, we're just doing our job.

339
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,420
Is this how Wang's Mansion
always treats its guests?

340
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,660
Always.

341
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,300
In that case,

342
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,940
I'd rather go home.

343
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,020
Please wait.

344
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,740
Miss Chu,

345
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,940
still got that temper, huh?

346
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,300
If you're going to invite me to dinner,

347
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,860
at least make it feel like a date,

348
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,780
not a lockdown.

349
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,020
Where's the fun in that?

350
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,980
Honestly, a quiet night with noodles
sounds way better than this.

351
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,500
My apologies.

352
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,300
I've pissed off
quite a few people lately,

353
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,820
so I've got to be a bit careful.

354
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,700
Mr. Wang, if you're that scared,

355
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,620
maybe you should
stop showing up for meals.

356
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,580
You'd be better off at home,

357
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,100
sipping tea and playing cards
with your ladies.

358
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,580
Much safer, wouldn't you say?

359
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,740
Miss Chu, please.

360
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,780
Oh, so now we're skipping the checks?

361
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,740
For you,

362
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,180
I'm willing to make an exception.

363
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,580
You...

364
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Mr. Wang,

365
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,500
you made an exception,

366
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,980
so let me put your mind at ease.

367
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,620
Clearly, you're not

368
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,420
carrying any weapons.

369
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,540
You think I should keep going?

370
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,020
No need.

371
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Honestly.

372
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,660
Please, come in.

373
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,660
It's been an hour, hasn't it?

374
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,300
Shouldn't dinner be over by now?

375
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,580
Not necessarily.

376
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,300
I should have gone with her.

377
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,660
Zhiqiu,

378
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,420
you seem unusually tense.

379
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm not nervous,

380
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,380
but worried.

381
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,500
Miss Chu,

382
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,580
how's the food today?

383
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,100
Fresh ingredients, sure.

384
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,740
Just a shame
the cooking's stuck in the past.

385
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,740
And the wine?

386
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,940
It's pricey, sure.

387
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,460
But it feels more suited
to a state banquet than a date.

388
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,020
Doesn't really match the mood tonight.

389
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,540
It seems you're very particular
about dining.

390
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,620
I'm even more so with who I date.

391
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,740
Miss Chu,

392
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,500
try these three dishes.

393
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,980
Miss Chu,

394
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,900
how do you

395
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,860
like them?

396
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,660
Mr. Wang, that pile of valuables
you're flashing?

397
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,220
I could earn that much in a single year.

398
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,540
So really,

399
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,660
it's nothing to you, is it?

400
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,020
What I mean is,

401
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,180
if you're thinking of marrying me,

402
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,340
that's fine.

403
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,700
You don't need to offer anything.

404
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,900
I might even

405
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,780
throw in my entire net worth.

406
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,820
You're truly remarkable.

407
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,540
I do have a few conditions, though.

408
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,700
Please go ahead.

409
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,060
Look,

410
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,140
with the kind of money I've got,

411
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,460
I just can't marry someone
who's not on the same level,

412
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,100
right?

413
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
So,

414
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,260
I want to know exactly
how much money you've got.

415
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,340
I need to be sure
it's worth trusting you with my life.

416
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,300
Don't worry. I won't let you down.

417
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,380
In business, we don't rely on words.
We deal in facts.

418
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,780
What do you want?

419
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Let me take a look at your assets.

420
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,020
No problem.

421
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,140
Mr. Xia,

422
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,500
you're still going through the accounts?

423
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,220
She's got you. That's enough.

424
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,060
Miss Chu,

425
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,420
please.

426
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,540
What do you think?

427
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,500
Hope that's good enough for you.

428
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,060
No need to check this out.

429
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,100
Why?

430
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,100
These are ledgers.

431
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,740
Well then, I'm even more interested.

432
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,660
Why?

433
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,380
You may not know,

434
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,900
but I love poring over ledgers.

435
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,380
Debt,

436
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,300
profit,

437
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,860
gains, losses,

438
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
trends,

439
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,980
real financial standing,

440
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,420
all laid out, plain as day.

441
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,420
Don't those count?

442
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,500
Mr. Wang, no matter how much of this
you've got,

443
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,700
it's all dead assets.

444
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,380
Only the money in the ledger is liquid.

445
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,660
And only liquid capital

446
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,900
can make more money.

447
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,860
That's your real wealth.

448
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
Makes sense.

449
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,660
However, my ledgers

450
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,460
are a bit different from others.

451
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,260
How so?

452
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,700
What do you have in there

453
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,940
that's unspeakable?

454
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,940
Once

455
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,940
you've seen it,

456
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,340
you're bound to me for life.

457
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,380
Isn't that exactly what you want?

458
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,860
So?

459
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,380
Are you satisfied?

460
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,260
Mr. Wang,

461
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,820
I only wish you'd met me sooner.

462
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,700
If I'd been managing your accounts,

463
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,460
I could've doubled

464
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,620
your income last year.

465
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,780
Oh? You're that good?

466
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,540
Wen's Pharmacy rose to the top

467
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,220
in Shanghai in just several years.

468
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,140
How else do you think that happened?

469
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,900
That's because I joined half a year ago.

470
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,620
You mean I'm the one in power,

471
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,460
and you're the one making money?

472
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,780
That's actually a good idea.

473
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,100
Put it away.

474
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,900
Miss Chu,

475
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,300
I've fulfilled your conditions.

476
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,060
Now

477
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,380
it's your turn

478
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,940
to meet mine.

479
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,980
No need to rush.

480
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,620
I have one more condition.

481
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,940
Another one? What is it?

482
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,420
Tell me.

483
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,260
Listen.

484
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,820
I want to be your one
and only legal wife.

485
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,540
What?

486
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
The only one.

487
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,580
I don't care

488
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,100
how many wives or concubines
you had before.

489
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,340
You'll have to dismiss
every single one of them.

490
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,580
And after our marriage,
you're not allowed to take any more.

491
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,620
What kind of condition is that?

492
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,540
Absolutely out of the question.

493
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,860
You won't agree?

494
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,540
Then

495
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,260
there's nothing more to talk about.

496
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,540
Mr. Wang, I'll take my leave.

497
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,540
Miss Chu,

498
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,020
you're pushing it.

499
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,900
I gave you respect.
Don't make me regret it.

500
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,460
You think you can just come and go

501
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,740
as you please?

502
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,820
Did you notice

503
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,140
that one pearl is missing
from my earring?

504
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,420
Five seconds left.

505
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,340
What?

506
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,180
The poison's about to kick in.

507
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,620
Muscle tremors,

508
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,700
dizziness, fatigue,

509
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,500
and cramps in your lower abdomen.

510
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,780
You poisoned me?

511
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,580
Before I came here today,

512
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,740
I blended several poisons together

513
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,060
and made a pearl-shaped earring.

514
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,420
I wore it right here.

515
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,060
Look,

516
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,140
with the kind of money I've got,

517
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,580
I just can't marry someone
who's not on the same level,

518
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,220
right?

519
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,260
So,

520
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,140
I want to know exactly
how much money you've got.

521
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,060
You!

522
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,060
You wretched woman!

523
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,060
You actually poisoned me!

524
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:10,740
You...

525
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,860
Regardless of the poison,

526
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,620
if you don't get the antidote

527
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,140
in half an hour,

528
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,540
Mr. Wang,

529
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,260
you won't live

530
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,780
to see tomorrow.

531
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,780
Miss Chu, give me the antidote.

532
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,060
Take it out, now!

533
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,820
Alright.

534
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,980
Let me go,

535
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,540
and I promise

536
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,500
you'll have the antidote in 30 minutes.

537
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,700
Someone!

538
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,060
Guards!

539
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,220
Search this wretched woman

540
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,260
and find the antidote!

541
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,940
Hurry up!

542
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,260
Yes, sir!

543
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,260
A bunch of fools!

544
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,420
If it were you,

545
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,660
would you carry the antidote around?

546
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,180
Go find Wen Zhiqiu

547
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,260
and bring me the antidote!

548
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,860
Don't bother.

549
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,220
I've already hidden it somewhere safe.

550
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,820
Apart from me,

551
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,660
no one knows where it is.

552
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,060
Think I won't pull the trigger?

553
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,820
I do.

554
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,180
In 29 minutes,

555
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,940
we'll meet in the underworld.

556
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,740
I...

557
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,620
You...

558
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,780
Twenty-eight minutes left.

559
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,140
Why is it still quiet?

560
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,620
What are you doing?

561
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,420
To save her.

562
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,980
Just like this?

563
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,820
What else can I do?

564
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,180
Aren't you just making things worse?

565
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,260
I can't wait anymore.

566
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,540
Mr. Xia.

567
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,620
I'm telling you,

568
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,140
I won't stop you.

569
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,380
Think carefully.

570
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,620
If you rush in like this,

571
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,300
are you saving her
or putting her in more danger?

572
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,420
Hey, what are you doing?

573
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,060
If you hadn't come out,
I would've stormed in.

574
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,580
Are you okay?

575
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
Hold on, Mr. Wen.

576
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,380
Keep it together, alright?

577
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,820
Let's go.

578
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,100
Hey, I'm your fiancé.
It's kind of my job.

579
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,100
Dr. Tang, please save me.

580
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,540
Hurry up.

581
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,340
Mr. Wang,

582
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,740
I need to know
what kind of poison you took

583
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,780
before I can help you.

584
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,340
But...

585
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,460
I don't care what it is,

586
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,660
just give me something!

587
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,420
If I give you the wrong medication now,

588
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,700
it could make things worse.

589
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,740
That's...

590
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,180
You...

591
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,820
What time is it?

592
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,060
How much time do I have left?

593
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,540
Three minutes.

594
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,780
Three minutes?

595
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,300
Yes.

596
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:58,940
That's it.

597
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm going to die!

598
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,500
Why isn't the medicine here yet?

599
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,380
It's here!

600
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,260
We've got it!

601
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,740
Hawthorn?

602
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,500
That is the antidote?

603
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,300
Mr. Wang, there's a note.

604
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,060
Thanks for the hospitality, Mr. Wang.

605
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,500
It's been a lovely evening.

606
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,460
Chu Shaohua.

607
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,020
She's...

608
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,500
Didn't expect that.

609
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,020
Really impressive.

610
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,700
Mr. Lu.

611
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,940
This is Miss Chu.

612
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,300
It's you.

613
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,500
Mr. Lu.

614
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,460
Please, have a seat.

615
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,140
So, you're asking me
to deal with Wang Guodong, is that it?

616
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,900
I'm just trying to protect myself.

617
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,180
But if I get involved,

618
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,780
between Jiangsu and Zhejiang,

619
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,460
I'm afraid things could spiral into war.

620
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,740
Even if I don't pull you in,

621
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,460
this conflict is bound to happen.

622
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,380
But it might hold it off for a while.

623
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,700
For how long?

624
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,500
Until they get stronger?

625
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,300
Why would you say that, Miss Chu?

626
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,860
Since Jufeng Trading Corporation
was founded last year,

627
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,340
up until October this year,

628
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,140
it has generated a total profit
of around 23 million silver dollars.

629
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,380
Around the 10th of each month,

630
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,500
between 700,000

631
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,620
and 1 million silver dollars

632
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,100
is transferred directly
from the company to an account

633
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,620
under the codename Wendao.

634
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,860
Additionally, on March 13th,

635
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,420
350,000 pounds sterling

636
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,300
was remitted to Carlowitz & Co.

637
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,100
On June 22nd,

638
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,820
830,000 US dollars

639
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,900
was transferred
under Mr. Sassoon's name.

640
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,700
What do you think?

641
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,740
Where did you get all this information?

642
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,260
Last night,

643
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,380
I saw
Jufeng Trading Corporation's ledger.

644
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,060
That's private.

645
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,420
How could an outsider like you
have access to it?

646
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,700
Even if you did see it,

647
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,500
how could you possibly recall

648
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,540
that many numbers out of thin air?

649
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,700
You don't have to doubt her.

650
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,500
I know what she's capable of.

651
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,660
If everything Miss Chu said is true,

652
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,740
then Wang Guodong profited
from smuggling opium,

653
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,900
23 million silver dollars
a year.

654
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,340
That's enough to outfit
three full divisions.

655
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,900
Wendao

656
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,900
should be Qi Fuwan, right?

657
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,860
There was word earlier

658
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,460
that Wang Guodong bought 7,000 rifles

659
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,580
from Carlowitz & Co.,

660
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,260
and picked up five cannons from Sassoon.

661
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,140
The dates and amounts all match up.

662
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,060
I wonder if this information

663
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,060
is enough for you
to make an immediate decision?

664
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,380
Alright.

665
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,780
I'll make it happen.

666
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,060
But what do I get in return?

667
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,380
What do you need?

668
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,420
I need you

669
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,300
to stay close to Wang Guodong.

670
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,700
Why would I even bother sitting here?

671
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,260
Laying the groundwork takes time.

672
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,180
Making the move

673
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,260
takes the right moment.

674
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,340
Understood.

675
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,540
Miss Chu,

676
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,620
deal.

677
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,660
We're even.

678
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:14,700
By the way,

679
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,780
Miss Chu,

680
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
a year ago, why were you so certain

681
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,660
you could help me
win back those three chips?

682
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,420
It's a game of probability.

683
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,820
As long as you lose, you just double

684
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,340
the betting amount and bet again.

685
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,060
As long as you win once,

686
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,180
you can cover all previous losses,

687
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,980
and even make a profit.

688
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,620
But why did you say

689
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,540
the real winner is the house?

690
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,940
I used to

691
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,580
sell pens at a department store.

692
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,700
To boost sales, I came up with an idea

693
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,420
called Guanpu.

694
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,740
It meant some people

695
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,140
could get a ten-dollar pen

696
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,980
for just five jiao.

697
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,180
But others, with the same five jiao,

698
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,100
only ended up with an eraser
worth a few fen.

699
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,620
Still, most people

700
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,220
believed they'd be the lucky one,

701
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,220
so they kept buying, again and again.

702
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,220
And in the end, the real winner

703
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,780
was the department store
selling Guanpu products.

704
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,260
Miss Chu,

705
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,860
with a mind like yours,

706
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
working as a pharmacy manager

707
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,500
feels like a waste of talent.

708
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,900
I feel the same way.

709
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,580
This is just the start.

710
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,460
We've got time ahead of us.

711
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,980
We'll see each other again.

712
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,700
So, what's next?

713
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,060
Mr. Lu agreed to help.

714
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,460
But on one condition,

715
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,660
Miss Chu has to keep dealing
with Wang Guodong.

716
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,380
She still has to?

717
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,180
Didn't she just get out safely?

718
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,780
We don't have a choice.

719
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,780
Alright.

720
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,460
You can't stay

721
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,820
where you live right now.

722
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,420
I'll find you somewhere safe first.

723
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,460
Welcome to my home.

724
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,460
This is the safe place you mentioned?

725
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,980
This is the French Concession.

726
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,300
Even if Wang Guodong is full of himself,

727
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,740
he wouldn't dare come here for you.

728
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,420
Then you're
seriously underestimating him.

729
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,060
That's exactly why

730
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,180
I'll be staying close to you

731
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,660
from now on.

732
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,300
Here. It'll make things easier for you.

733
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,780
Thank you.

734
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,940
You can sleep in this room.

735
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,220
I've put in brand-new sheets, comforter,
and pillows.

736
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Where will you sleep then?

737
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,500
Next to you.

738
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,540
On the sofa.

739
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,300
Can't you just say
the whole thing at once?

740
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,940
I didn't want to freak you out
by blurting it all out.

741
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,500
What could possibly scare me now?

742
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,740
Don't you feel like

743
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
I've been treating you differently?

744
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,940
I've been thinking

745
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,300
maybe I'm falling for you.

746
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,780
You got me.

747
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,060
There's more. Want to hear it?

748
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,180
No, I don't.

749
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,740
I'm feeling a bit worn out.

750
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,940
I need to rest for a bit.

751
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,340
I'll go with you.

752
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,020
I usually sleep next to the bed anyway.

753
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,700
Dinner's ready.

754
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,300
Quite a feast.

755
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,500
It's your first time here.

756
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,060
Of course I'm going to treat you right.

757
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,100
Wen Zhiqiu,

758
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,620
you really need
to get yourself a girlfriend

759
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,180
and save the sweet talk for her.

760
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,700
Getting a girlfriend is so expensive.

761
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,940
Why are you giving me chopsticks
for Western food?

762
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,340
Using chopsticks for French food

763
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,540
is totally a thing now.

764
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,660
You're good at everything.

765
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,940
Cooking,

766
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,140
being thoughtful,

767
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,380
even business,

768
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,820
but you're just too caught up in money,

769
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,660
and can't pull yourself out.

770
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,500
Sounds like a good thing to me.

771
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,140
Haven't you ever considered

772
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,180
being in a real relationship?

773
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,020
A real relationship?

774
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,940
I haven't before,

775
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,380
and I don't know about the future.

776
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,260
After hearing you say that,

777
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,540
I don't think you ever will.

778
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,100
What if I really meet someone

779
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,420
I fall for completely and hopelessly,

780
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,980
someone who sees money as nothing

781
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,340
and makes me
want to swear loyalty for life?

782
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,380
"Sees money as nothing"?

783
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,460
If that's your standard,
good luck finding them.

784
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,620
What if I really do find
someone like that?

785
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,820
If you do,

786
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
I'll congratulate you,

787
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,060
give you a generous gift

788
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,220
and treat you both to dinner.

789
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,980
And if that day ever comes for you,

790
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,820
I'll offer a generous gift

791
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,740
and treat you to dinner.

792
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,540
Sounds great.

793
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,140
Too bad I probably won't ever get that.

794
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:02,900
Try this.

795
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,140
This? You made it?

796
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,620
The landlady did.

797
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,220
It tastes alright.

798
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,220
Just not quite

799
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,380
how I'd make it.

800
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,980
You can cook?

801
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,660
Of course.

802
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,220
I used to cook for my whole family.

803
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,980
Really?

804
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,820
You should cook tomorrow.

805
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,580
I'm way too lazy for that.

806
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,140
Escaping?

807
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,500
Are you running
from what you've been through,

808
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,980
who you used to know,

809
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,420
or maybe from the person you used to be?

810
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,380
Is there even a difference?

811
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,620
It was your husband, wasn't it?

812
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,620
I'm still feeling a bit tired.

813
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,900
I'll crash for a bit.

814
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Dinner was great, thank you.

815
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,260
Hope you enjoy the rest.

816
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,860
Let's talk a bit more.

817
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,940
I saw you standing behind the door.

818
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,820
Who is it?

819
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,060
I'll go.

820
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,700
Wait.

821
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,500
Mr. Wang.

822
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,220
Mr. Wen.

823
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
Miss Chu.

824
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,740
Good morning.

825
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,220
Good morning, Mr. Wang.

826
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,500
Mr. Wang, this is the French Concession.

827
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,020
Trespassing

828
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,460
could land you in jail, don't you know?

829
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,580
You can report me if you want.

830
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,780
Mr. Wang, is there something
you need me for?

831
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,140
I invited you to dinner
the day before yesterday.

832
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,140
What you did really scared me.

833
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,140
I'm here today

834
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,380
because I need answers.

835
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,540
Understood.

836
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,580
Zhiqiu,

837
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,820
I need a quick chat with Mr. Wang.

838
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,820
Mind giving us a little space?

839
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,300
Get this straight. This is my home.

840
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,700
You're my fiancée.

841
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,180
And you want me to leave?

842
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,740
It'll just be for a moment.

843
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,820
Alright, you can talk here.

844
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,980
Just leave.

845
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,740
I'm trying to protect you.

846
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
That's enough.

847
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,700
Don't get too carried away.

848
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,020
I got away then,

849
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,580
and I can do it again now.

850
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,740
Trust me.

851
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,220
Alright, I'll wait outside the door.

852
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,700
If anything happens, just yell.

853
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,820
I'll come in, gun blazing.

854
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,780
It won't come to that.

855
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,380
Alright.

856
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,820
Keep it.

857
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,620
No need.

858
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,860
Mr. Wang.

859
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
Make yourself at home.

860
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,180
You guys, take care of Mr. Wen.

861
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,740
Mr. Wang,

862
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,820
would you like black tea or green tea?

863
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,020
Anything will do.

864
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,460
Idiot.

865
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,260
Do you have a cigarette?

866
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,500
Where are you off to?

867
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,660
Just grabbing a pack downstairs.

868
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,220
Want to come along?

869
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,740
Follow him.

870
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,460
[Blue Stone Apartment]

871
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,020
Let's tag along.

872
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,740
Mr. Wang, please have some tea.

873
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,580
What?

874
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,580
Afraid I'll poison you again?

875
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,580
I've learned to be extra careful

876
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,300
