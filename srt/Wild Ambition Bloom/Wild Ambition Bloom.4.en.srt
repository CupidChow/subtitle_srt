under her persuasion.

189
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,660
What about those two new assistants

190
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,940
we hired?

191
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,540
We promise to stay open all night,

192
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,140
receive prescriptions, deliver medicine,
decoct medicine for customers,

193
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,660
and process tonic pastes at their homes.

194
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
We ran short on staff,

195
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
so I brought in two new hires.

196
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,740
Don't you know,

197
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,460
if we hire people,

198
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,900
we'll have to pay more wages?

199
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,020
But now the business

200
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,660
is more than ten percent
better than before.

201
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,940
This was all Shaohua's idea, wasn't it?

202
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,820
Yes.

203
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,540
She does have a knack for it.

204
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,660
Father,

205
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,660
why don't we let Shaohua come

206
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,780
to help officially?

207
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,860
No way.

208
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,900
We may be struggling,

209
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,180
but we still have our dignity.

210
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,340
Having her help out
in the apothecary like that?

211
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,260
What would that make us?

212
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,300
But Shaohua is really good

213
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,940
at managing the apothecary, Father.

214
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,700
Dashun,

215
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,460
can't she assist you at home

216
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,820
just the same?

217
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,860
Father, I think...

218
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,020
Enough.

219
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,580
It's decided.

220
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,180
I don't want to hear another word.

221
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,460
I don't want to stay at home.

222
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,660
I actually think

223
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,580
staying home
is the right call right now.

224
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,620
Why?

225
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,940
Think about it.

226
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,020
Don't forget you're carrying

227
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,780
a child.

228
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,300
Helping at the apothecary

229
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,940
means early mornings

230
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,300
and late nights.

231
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,100
You'll be rushing
back and forth every day.

232
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,980
What if something goes wrong?

233
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,940
If the baby gets hurt, that's one thing,

234
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,860
but if you get hurt,

235
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
I would be devastated.

236
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,980
Dashun,

237
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,900
I'm not afraid of being tired

238
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,140
or going through hardship.

239
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
You know that, right?

240
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,700
I do.

241
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,060
I'm afraid that courtyard
will be my whole world

242
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,860
for my whole life.

243
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,720
I know.

244
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,340
That's never going to happen.

245
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,140
Believe me.

246
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,300
I promise,

247
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,740
once you've given birth
and finished your recovery month,

248
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,220
I'll find a way to convince Father

249
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,980
to let you work here.

250
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,500
How much longer will that be?

251
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,340
Just bear with it for a few more months.

252
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,580
Let me take it.

253
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,180
Be good, okay?

254
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,700
Mother,

255
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,620
the hot water is ready.

256
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,900
Since your father-in-law has spoken,

257
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,780
from now on,

258
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,620
don't step out
of this courtyard anymore.

259
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,060
Stay put at home.

260
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,140
Did you hear me?

261
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,940
No sense of occasion either.

262
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,780
Come.

263
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,660
Help me put this hairpin on.

264
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,540
Here.

265
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,460
Give it to me.

266
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Oh my goodness, you poked me.

267
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,500
Never mind.

268
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,700
Why a cold towel?

269
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,380
What am I supposed to do with this?

270
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,580
What?

271
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,620
I barely said anything,

272
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,940
and you're already throwing a fit?

273
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,700
How rebellious!

274
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,140
So what if I am?

275
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,020
Shaohua!

276
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,740
What's wrong?

277
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,420
She was trying to hit me!

278
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,900
How dare she!

279
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,500
Where's my pearl earring?

280
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,660
They cost me three silver dollars!

281
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,500
Can you afford to pay for it?

282
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,340
Don't just stand there.

283
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,500
Help me up!

284
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,100
Applying pearl powder to the face

285
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,340
gives a radiant complexion.

286
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,060
Shaohua,

287
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,140
I can't believe it.

288
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,540
Shaohua.

289
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,540
Shaohua.

290
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,860
Shaohua.

291
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,220
Shaohua.

292
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,260
We can't just go out.

293
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,020
Dashun.

294
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,380
Shaohua?

295
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,100
Dashun.

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:53,540
What happened?

297
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,060
Father.

298
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,900
Pearl powder.

299
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,340
What about it?

300
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,380
- What pearl powder?
- Pearl powder.

301
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,340
Take a seat.

302
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,100
Help her sit there.

303
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,620
Sit down.

304
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,420
Take your time.

305
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,340
Father,

306
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,700
we can grind the pearl into powder,

307
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,300
then mix it

308
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,580
with Danggui, Taoren, Chuanxiong,

309
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,020
Baizhi, Baifuzi,

310
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,260
and Baiji's powder

311
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,540
to make a whitening beauty powder
that we can sell.

312
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,540
Beauty powder?

313
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,860
Yes. Unless they're sick,

314
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,500
most people won't step
into an apothecary.

315
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,220
And even then,
they'll just go to the nearest one.

316
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,980
So the apothecary's reach

317
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,340
only covers households within three li.

318
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,820
But if we sell this beauty powder,

319
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,220
we can break both those limits

320
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,900
and

321
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,700
increase our income by 20%.

322
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,340
Impossible.

323
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,180
Why?

324
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,420
Medicinal pearls and these

325
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,860
are two entirely different things.

326
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,980
Medicinal pearls?

327
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,100
Then we can procure medicinal pearls.

328
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,340
This is an apothecary.

329
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,860
Selling things like that

330
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,780
feels like abandoning our proper work.

331
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,940
Father,

332
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,580
as the saying goes,
a healer's heart is compassionate,

333
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,900
and medicine exists to cure.

334
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,580
For women,

335
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
when beauty fades,

336
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,100
the heart suffers too.

337
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,380
So beauty powder is fair business
for an apothecary.

338
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,380
Father, I think she is right.

339
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,860
Moreover, women

340
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,260
all love beauty.

341
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,860
They'll pay anything

342
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,100
to look good.

343
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,940
At today's pearl prices,

344
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,740
making one box of beauty powder

345
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,180
costs less than a hundred wen.

346
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
But we can sell it

347
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,740
for one or two silver dollars.

348
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,540
That means the profit

349
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,140
is way higher than regular medicines.

350
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:42,980
Father,

351
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I think Shaohua's method is feasible.

352
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,900
For an apothecary to thrive,

353
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,340
it must have its own
secret formulas and remedies.

354
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,740
This is exactly

355
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,180
where we've been

356
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,820
falling short.

357
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,580
But now,

358
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,260
we can make this beauty powder

359
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,900
our own secret remedy.

360
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,660
Then our success

361
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,060
will be just around the corner,
won't it?

362
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,660
Dashun,

363
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,980
you've gotten good

364
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,580
at talking, haven't you?

365
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,780
Father, I learned it all from Shaohua.

366
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,860
Well, I heard it from my grandpa.

367
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,100
Looks like

368
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,660
you truly picked up

369
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,620
your grandfather's wisdom.

370
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,740
It's nothing that impressive.

371
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,940
It's just that when I was little,

372
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,580
I loved hearing him tell stories.

373
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,180
So over time,

374
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,380
I picked up a few things.

375
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,900
Good.

376
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,260
Excellent, honestly.

377
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,500
Father,

378
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,100
why don't we let Shaohua

379
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,620
come help out here?

380
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,500
With her talent,

381
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,340
doing laundry and cooking
every day at home

382
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,100
feels like such a waste.

383
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,980
Darling!

384
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,660
Mother.

385
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,580
Darling!

386
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,260
What's wrong?

387
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,540
If you won't back me up

388
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,860
and deal with her,

389
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,500
I really don't know
how to keep running this household!

390
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,860
The disrespectful brat!

391
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,820
I barely said a word,

392
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,820
and she nearly hit me!

393
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,380
Mother, she isn't like that.

394
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,500
She's walked all over me now!

395
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,220
And you're still taking her side!

396
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,740
How could you be so cold?

397
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,500
Funny how getting married
made you forget who raised you.

398
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,940
You good-for-nothing!

399
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,860
Do you even care at all?

400
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,460
Mother,

401
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,420
you misunderstood me.

402
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,380
I didn't!

403
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,020
She really was going to hit me.

404
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,900
This is outrageous!

405
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,700
What exactly happened?

406
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,580
I don't know.

407
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,860
You don't understand the situation,

408
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,300
and you brought her over here?

409
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,260
Darling, she's talking nonsense,

410
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,460
and she won't admit it.

411
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
Mother, just now,

412
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,140
I thought of a secret formula for us,

413
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,740
and in my excitement,

414
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,020
I knocked over the basin of water.

415
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,140
Mother,

416
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,980
I apologize to you.

417
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,420
It was my fault.

418
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,220
I made too much noise

419
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,340
and startled you.

420
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,900
Mother, see?

421
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,740
It was

422
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,660
a misunderstanding.

423
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,740
Oh, I can't accept that.

424
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,780
Darling.

425
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,540
Alright,

426
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,860
knock it out!

427
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,700
I know what happened.

428
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,700
Darling.

429
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,700
Shaohua.

430
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,420
Father.

431
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,060
You're part of this family now.

432
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,540
You must follow our rules,

433
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,860
respect your parents,
and watch your words.

434
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,940
Even if

435
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,540
her actions don't please you,

436
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,500
you must

437
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,860
comply and be tolerant.

438
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,220
That's the right way, isn't it?

439
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,140
You are absolutely right.

440
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,260
I was wrong.

441
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,940
Smart

442
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,660
as you are,

443
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,860
you still need to learn some manners.

444
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,980
You're not fit to handle the chores,

445
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,180
let alone enjoy

446
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,460
the comforts of this home.

447
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,100
You'll be working here as punishment.

448
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,380
Really?

449
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
You should be grateful it's not worse.

450
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,780
Darling, is that it?

451
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,260
A harmonious home leads to success.

452
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
She's been punished, alright?

453
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,500
Help your mother back

454
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,100
and make sure she gets some good rest.

455
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,660
Let it go.

456
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,860
Go.

457
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,740
Song Ping, take your time.

458
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,220
It's done.

459
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,740
That's it.

460
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,380
Finally.

461
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,700
Song Ping?

462
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,900
It really is her.

463
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,740
She looks so different.

464
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,820
She's glowing, isn't she?

465
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,260
This Yurong Powder is amazing!

466
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,700
Alright then.

467
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,460
Let's

468
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,380
make a few boxes
and see if we can sell them.

469
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,900
Father,

470
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,860
how about giving the first batch away

471
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,500
for free?

472
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,700
Give it all away?

473
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,700
How can that be?

474
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,860
Try to relax, will you?

475
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,060
Shaohua,

476
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,980
tell us your reasons.

477
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,460
The results of Yurong Powder

478
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,700
speak for themselves.

479
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,260
Once used, it's something
you can't put down.

480
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,940
But it's

481
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,060
a new product,

482
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,540
and it's pricey.

483
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,660
Customers are going to hesitate

484
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,140
at first.

485
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,460
So I think,

486
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,900
how about starting by giving it away,

487
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,460
just to get people on board?

488
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,100
I believe

489
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,420
once people try it,

490
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,220
they'll keep

491
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,260
coming back.

492
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,260
So how many boxes
do you plan to give away?

493
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,020
At least 50.

494
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,780
Alright.

495
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,580
Since we're giving it away,

496
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,940
let's

497
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,580
drop the price

498
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,020
from three qian per box to one.

499
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,860
That's right.

500
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,260
Alright, we'll go with your plan.

501
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,220
Then I suggest

502
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,460
we give these 50 boxes

503
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,140
to our top clients' families.

504
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,220
First, it's a nice year-end gesture.

505
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,620
Second, they're

506
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,820
wealthy and influential.

507
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,020
If their families like it,

508
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,820
they'll help spread the word.

509
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Isn't that great?

510
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,180
Sounds good.

511
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,820
Makes sense.

512
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,460
No.

513
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
I think

514
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,300
we should give them all

515
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,780
to the girls in Bada Hutong.
[*Once the red-light district in Peking]

516
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,060
Shaohua,

517
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,700
how do you know
about such a sordid place?

518
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,820
Where is

519
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:05,860
Bada Hutong?

520
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,820
Don't ask.

521
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,060
Shaohua,

522
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,460
you've been there?

523
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,220
How is that even possible?

524
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,540
I just happened to pass by.

525
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,460
Shaohua,

526
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,220
you don't know
what kind of place that is,

527
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,660
right?

528
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,180
Yes.

529
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,100
They say...

530
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,020
I... I heard

531
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,980
Bada Hutong kicked off

532
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,460
all the fashion trends in Peking.

533
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,100
So I thought

534
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,540
if the girls in Bada Hutong

535
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,100
all start using Yurong Powder,

536
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
then before long,

537
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,140
all the women in Peking

538
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,540
will also follow suit.

539
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,100
Then we won't have to worry about sales.

540
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,220
Shaohua,

541
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,980
what do the girls there do?

542
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,300
Didn't I tell you not to ask?

543
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,980
Go cook.

544
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,180
Okay, Mother.

545
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,580
Mother,

546
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,900
why don't you try it too?

547
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,220
I wouldn't use it.

548
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,140
Such lowly places.

549
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,180
You expect me
to lower myself to that level?

550
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,140
I wouldn't take it even if you paid me!

551
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,740
Mother,

552
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,660
the ruffled edges on your clothes

553
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,340
came from Bada Hutong.

554
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,700
Father,

555
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,620
I think Shaohua makes a lot of sense.

556
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,860
The women there

557
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,340
receive guests

558
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,580
from all over the country.

559
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,020
One word from them,

560
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,940
and our product
will sweep across the land.

561
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,060
You're excited again, huh?

562
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,540
Why do you get so excited
when talking about these things?

563
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,020
Father, I only heard about it.

564
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:38,500
Father,

565
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,540
why not let me

566
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,060
handle Yurong Powder?

567
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,180
I'll recoup

568
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,820
all costs in a month,

569
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,460
and in three,

570
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,220
Yurong Powder

571
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,700
will be our biggest earner.

572
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,540
Alright?

573
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,220
Shaohua,

574
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,740
you should take it easy for now.

575
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,220
That's right.

576
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
You are pregnant.

577
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,060
Father,

578
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
I know what I'm doing.

579
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,220
Very well.

580
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,460
Well...

581
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,860
About Yurong Powder,

582
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,420
why did you...?

583
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,980
Why the sudden concern?

584
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,860
Ershun said

585
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
he wants to give it a try.

586
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:39,980
Him?

587
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,460
He was too young back then.

588
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
He didn't know any better

589
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,660
and hung out
with all sorts of bad influences.

590
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,020
It was no surprise
he ended up doing foolish things.

591
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,420
But ever since you sent him
back home to reflect,

592
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,220
he's been behaving properly.

593
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,980
Even after coming back to Peking,

594
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,540
he's been staying away
from those sketchy friends.

595
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,420
It would be best

596
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,740
to leave this to Shaohua.

597
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,220
What can a woman possibly do?

598
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,500
Instead of giving it to her,
you should let Ershun handle it.

599
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,660
Shaohua's just an outsider, after all.

600
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,540
Ershun is our son.

601
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,580
And he's not getting any younger.

602
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
If you don't give him something to do,

603
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,340
and he keeps lazing around
like this every day,

604
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
he's really going to waste his life.

605
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,900
Let me think about it, alright?

606
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,360
[Chen's Apothecary]

607
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,900
I'll only count goods and keep accounts?

608
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,900
Father is doing it for your good.

609
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,700
You're due in just a few months.

610
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,540
You shouldn't be overexerting yourself.

611
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,580
Selling Yurong Powder was my idea.

612
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,420
How to sell it was also my decision.

613
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,980
Why give it to Ershun and not me?

614
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
We're all family.

615
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,620
What difference does it make?

616
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,700
Yeah, it's different.

617
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,420
Alright.

618
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,260
Your top priority now is the baby.

619
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,780
Everything else can wait
until after the birth.

620
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,740
There's still plenty of time.

621
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,580
Okay?

622
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,340
Just be patient.

623
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,260
It's been two days
since we gave out the 50 boxes.

624
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,500
No one's placed an order.

625
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,620
Not even a single inquiry.

626
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
That shouldn't be the case.

627
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,940
Ershun.

628
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,780
Father.

629
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,500
Where did you deliver those boxes?

630
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,780
Baishun Hutong, Yanzhi Hutong,

631
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,460
Hanjia Hutong, Shitou Hutong.

632
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,540
I went everywhere Shaohua asked me

633
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,220
to deliver.

634
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,460
You got it to every house, right?

635
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,500
Shaohua,

636
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,740
there are only 50 in total.

637
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,380
You really think
I could hit every house?

638
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
Then send another 50.

639
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:15,860
More?

640
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,020
Yes.

641
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,820
Take a break and have some water.

642
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,340
How is it?

643
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,500
Still no sales today.

644
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,300
How many are left at home?

645
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,140
There are still 100 left.

646
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,500
Give them all away.

647
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,820
All of them?

648
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,380
Yes.

649
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,540
Do you know how much those cost?

650
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,420
I know.

651
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,900
Have you thought it over?

652
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,260
Don't send them all.

653
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,940
Fifty will be enough.

654
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,580
That works too.

655
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,300
Just leave it to me.

656
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,340
Care for a few?

657
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,820
How much is this?

658
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,620
What would you like to buy?

659
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,340
Excuse me, how do I
get to Dongmian Hutong?

660
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,340
Turn left outside and keep walking.

661
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,460
Alright, thanks.

662
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,260
Ershun.

663
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,140
Shaohua.

664
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,700
Let's give away

665
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,620
the last 50 boxes as well.

666
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,740
Got it.

667
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,820
I was hoping you'd say that.

668
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,060
Don't give any more.

669
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,100
Father.

670
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,780
Father.

671
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,420
Shaohua,

672
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,260
we've given away 150 boxes already,

673
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,940
and no one's buying.

674
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,060
So maybe

675
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,860
your method doesn't work.

676
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,020
Yes, it does.

677
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,540
Maybe we haven't given out enough yet.

678
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,220
We've covered all of Bada Hutong.
Still not enough?

679
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,140
Maybe they've only used it
for a few days

680
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,420
and probably haven't seen
any results yet.

681
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,980
That's it then.

682
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,500
No more Yurong Powder.

683
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,260
We'll keep

684
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,660
the last 50

685
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,460
and take our time selling.

686
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,180
Let's just sell as many as we can.

687
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,500
Father, we can't give up now.

688
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,180
It's like a pot of water

689
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,540
that's almost boiling.

690
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,460
Just one more piece of firewood,

691
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,700
and it'll be bubbling in no time.

692
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,780
Shaohua,

693
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,420
if you keep this up,

694
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,820
it's never going to end.

695
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,060
Father, please.

696
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Just another 50.

697
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,460
No. That's it. No more.

698
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,540
Those 50 boxes don't cost much.

699
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,180
But even a little is still money.

700
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,020
All of it

701
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,660
came from my sweat and effort.

702
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,460
It didn't come easy.

703
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,020
You've got to risk a little

704
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,420
to gain a lot.

705
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,780
Now I get

706
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,220
how your whole family

707
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,620
fell apart.

708
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,260
It was because we couldn't
see far ahead.

709
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,900
Shaohua.

710
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,220
What did you say?

711
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Is this Chen's Apothecary?

712
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,900
Yes.

713
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,780
You've got

714
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,980
Yurong Powder, right?

715
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,380
Yes. It's our product.

716
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,700
Got any left?

717
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,100
I'll take 100 boxes.

718
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,300
- Yes.
- A hundred boxes.

719
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,340
Father.

720
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,820
Oh, and my friend in Jinan Prefecture

721
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,060
is asking about Yurong Powder too.

722
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,860
She wants me to get 200 boxes for her.

723
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,340
We have it all.

724
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,780
Do you offer dropshipping?

725
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,620
Yes.

726
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,340
We do dropshipping too.

727
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,340
This is the place.

728
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,060
Is this it?

729
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,060
What do you need?

730
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,900
This is it, right?

731
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,500
That's it.

732
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,140
What do you need, please?

733
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,060
Sir, I'd like three boxes
of the Yurong Powder.

734
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,860
Okay.

735
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,420
I want five.

736
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,020
Alright.

737
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,620
I also want three boxes.

738
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,100
Shitou.

739
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,620
Sir,

740
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,060
our madam asked me to buy Yurong Powder.

741
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Got any left?

742
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,820
Sorry, we're all sold out.

743
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,140
Any idea when you'll restock?

744
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,700
The day after tomorrow at the latest.

745
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,260
- Father.
- Alright then.

746
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,260
I'll order ten boxes.

747
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,700
Sorry, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

748
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,580
Please don't hold it against me.

749
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,420
Go help the customers.

750
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,180
Okay.

751
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,260
Guys, hurry.

752
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,660
Come.

753
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,940
Quick, help out!

754
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,180
Shitou.

755
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,060
Record the sales.

756
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,820
Dashun.

757
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,980
What's wrong?

758
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,620
My stomach...

759
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,420
- I...
- What's wrong?

760
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,140
What's going on?

761
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,260
Is Shaohua okay?

762
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,500
Is it a boy or a girl?

763
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,060
Congratulations, sir.

764
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,380
Congratulations, madam.

765
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,700
The mother and daughter are doing fine.

766
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,300
Tch, a girl.

767
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,020
Girls are wonderful.
Maybe she'll turn out like Shaohua.

768
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,940
Song Ping, are the eggs cooked yet?

769
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,660
- Almost.
- Okay.

770
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,860
I'll go check.

771
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,580
Mother, the eggs are ready.

772
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,540
Wait a moment.

773
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
Alright, take them to Shaohua.

774
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,780
Don't just stand there, go!

775
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,180
So clumsy.

776
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,620
You...

777
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,620
Has she given birth?

778
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,020
It's a girl.

779
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,620
It's fine.

780
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,060
With this first one,

781
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,700
the second one will follow soon.

782
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,820
Hoping the second one is a boy, right?

783
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,700
Eat them while they're hot.

784
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,980
She takes after your eyes and brows.

785
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,020
Her mouth is also like yours.

786
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,340
She's got your face shape too.

787
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,820
And how is she like you then?

788
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,260
Her ears are like mine.

789
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,700
They bring good fortune.

790
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,260
So you wanted to praise yourself, huh?

791
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,340
What kind of luck do you have?

792
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,260
Me?

793
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,380
If I hadn't been lucky,

794
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,780
how could I have ended up with you?

795
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,020
Xuan, this is Grandfather.

796
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,900
She smiled.

797
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,780
A baby's smile brings good fortune.

798
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,580
You know what,

799
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,140
ever since we had this little girl,

800
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,220
our business

801
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,060
has just shot up,

802
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,460
right?

803
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,180
So

804
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,620
this little one

805
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
even brings good fortune.

806
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,460
How about bringing us
a grandson, huh?

807
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,780
Xuan.

808
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,660
Grandpa's gift for meeting you.

809
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,340
Grandma will keep it for you.

810
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,500
She's smiling at me.

811
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,100
Shaohua.

812
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,980
Here, this is your reward.

813
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,180
Father, I don't need it.

814
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Exactly, rewarding for having a girl?

815
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,060
What are you saying?

816
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,540
This year,

817
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,060
our business jumped by 50 percent.

818
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,940
Shaohua,

819
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,020
it's all thanks to you.

820
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,500
Take it.

821
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,220
Go ahead.

822
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,860
Thank you, Father.

823
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,900
Dashun.

824
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
You manage all our family's money.

825
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,580
You take it.

826
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,620
Okay, I'll hold it for you.

827
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,980
Shaohua is quite sensible.

828
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,780
Father gave you 20 silver dollars
in the red packet.

829
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,260
This is

830
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,620
the first time
he's given his daughter-in-law

831
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,540
a red packet.

832
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,740
He truly values you.

833
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,860
However much he values me,

834
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,940
all I got was 20 silver dollars.

835
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,620
What, you expected more?

836
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,540
Yes.

837
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,860
Ershun and Song Ping
didn't get anything.

838
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Father also said

839
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,860
because of me,

840
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,100
our family's business

841
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,700
increased by 50 percent.

842
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,020
So the boost in business I brought in

843
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,860
is only worth 20 silver dollars?

844
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,220
Or is that all I'm worth to this family?

845
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,780
We're family. Why fuss over money?

846
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,700
So what if I do?

847
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,500
How much are you asking for?

848
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,100
I was the one who delivered
Yurong Powder to every house.

849
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,140
Why did Father reward her but not me?

850
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,220
Because she's capable.

851
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,860
How dare you say that?

852
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,580
When will you

853
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,780
earn 20 silver dollars back for me?

854
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,900
Harder!

855
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
You eat like a horse every day.
Where's all that energy?

856
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,940
Looks like Ershun
kept his temper in check today.

857
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,300
She's hopeless sometimes.

858
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,580
I've gone over this
with her again and again.

859
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,020
He shouts at you?

860
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,660
You shout right back.

861
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,500
He tries to hit you?

862
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,780
You hit him back.

863
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,300
How many times have I told her?
She just won't learn.

864
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,180
Not everyone is like you.

865
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,700
Oh, right.

866
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,500
I need to tell you something.

867
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,180
Ershun's accounts
for the past two months

868
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,060
don't quite add up.

869
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,380
How much is missing?

870
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
At least 200, I'd say.

871
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,260
Are you sure he tampered with it?

872
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,500
Or is it just a temporary shift?

873
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,860
I wouldn't know that.

874
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,940
How about this?

875
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,380
You ask him when no one else is around.

876
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,940
Let's get this matter clear.

877
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,380
If he did tamper with it,

878
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,460
I'll talk to Father.

879
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,340
Okay.

880
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,340
If Ershun has really reverted
to his old ways,

881
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,860
Father won't give him another chance.

882
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,480
[Chen's Apothecary]

883
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,260
Shaohua.

884
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,220
Ershun.

885
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,340
I picked up last month's payment

886
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,620
from Linfang Pavilion and Qingya Parlor.

887
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,300
Okay.

888
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,140
Are you here alone?

889
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,060
Yes, Father and Dashun
went out on business.

890
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,380
All the assistants went out
to deliver medicines.

891
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,220
Oh, right, Ershun.

892
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,860
Are you free now?

893
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,140
Yes, I am.

894
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,940
I need to talk to you about something.

895
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,100
Sure.

896
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,900
Take a seat.

897
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,860
Shaohua,

898
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
you've become

899
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,620
even more stunning since giving birth.

900
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,860
Have some tea.

901
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,900
Shaohua, sorry,

902
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,620
my hand slipped.

903
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,740
Shaohua,

904
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,140
I've noticed how hard

905
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,100
you've been working.

906
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,340
So I got you some snacks.

907
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,140
It's still warm.

908
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,460
Have a taste.

909
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,900
I mean, with your looks,

910
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,300
it's such a waste

911
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,420
not to doll yourself up.

912
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,020
Why didn't my brother

913
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,980
ever get you any decent jewelry?

914
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,060
I'll fix that.

915
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,260
Gemstone earrings, coming your way.

916
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,660
Ershun.

917
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,460
Excuse me.

918
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
My hand slipped too.

919
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,620
I'm bleeding!

920
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,460
I just went to Mother's room
to pick up Xuan,

921
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,380
and she asked when we're going

922
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,500
to give her a grandson.

923
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,620
If she asks again,

924
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,140
just tell her

925
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,300
we've got our hands full,

926
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,180
and we'll think about it
once the apothecary's business takes off.

927
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,420
I don't want you to be too tired.

928
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,620
You're busy with the apothecary
during the day,

929
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,380
and taking care of Xuan at night.

930
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:38,980
How about this?

931
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,460
Let Xuan stay with Mother at night.

932
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,820
No, that won't do.

933
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,260
Don't worry.

934
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,780
Father's made it clear

935
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,460
that Mother will be helping with Xuan.

936
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,900
She'll take good care of her, no doubt.

937
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,100
It's not that I don't trust her,

938
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,020
I just hate being away from Xuan.

939
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,340
Check this out.

940
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,740
How is it?

941
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,660
It's delicate.

942
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,060
With you and me on it,
we can both protect Xuan.

943
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,340
Come on, Xuan.

944
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,220
Ershun.

945
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,300
Ershun.

946
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,580
What do you want?

947
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,500
Why the attitude?

948
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,340
I made you new insoles.

949
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,900
Come out.

950
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,660
Hurry.

951
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,700
It's so late.

952
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,780
Take them.

953
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,620
What happened to your head?

954
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,300
Nothing.

955
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,100
Hey,

956
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
what happened?

957
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,940
Just bumped into a tree. No big deal.

958
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,460
How did that happen?

959
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,140
How could you be so careless?

960
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,980
Does it hurt?

961
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,020
Alright, stop asking.

962
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,020
Ershun.

963
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,860
That cut looks bad.

964
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,420
Better get some medicine on it!

965
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,860
Listen up.

966
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,740
No money today,

967
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,380
and we're not leaving.

968
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,660
Exactly.

969
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,940
Tell Chen Ershun to come out!

970
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,100
I'm staying right here!

971
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,580
Could you please move aside?

972
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:07,700
You're blocking our business.

973
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,780
Exactly, could you please
not block the entrance?

974
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,900
It's no use for you to wait here.

975
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,260
He went to Shanxi to get goods

976
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,340
and won't be back until tonight.

977
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,260
Shitou.

978
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,620
Ma'am.

979
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,820
What's going on?

980
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,580
They came early this morning

981
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
to collect a debt
from Second Young Master.

982
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,500
What debt?

983
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,340
What else could it be?

984
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,060
Ma'am.

985
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
We need to get someone to send word

986
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,140
to tell Second Young Master
to hurry back.

987
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,420
This makes us look bad to the customers.

988
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,940
When will my father be back?

989
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,100
Noon.

990
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,580
Okay, got it.

991
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,020
Get back to what you were doing.

992
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,620
I'll talk to them.

993
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,220
Okay.

994
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,220
Gentlemen.

995
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,460
You're here for Chen Ershun, right?

996
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,340
Who are you?

997
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,860
I'm his sister-in-law.
