31
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,330
If he's not studying,
why don't we use this money

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,210
to get Bao some assets?

33
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,620
After all, it's meant for him.

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,620
Isn't that good?

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,850
You're going too far.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,490
You're right. That's not appropriate.

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,930
How about this?

Why not take Bao in as your son?

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,570

for a mother to spend on her child.

this is fair to your brother and me?

Tell me straight.

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,290
In what way have I wronged you?

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,380

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,780
I really don't.

62
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,540
You killed Chen Ershun's entire family

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,220
just to run away with some man.

64
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,010
What nonsense are you talking about?

65
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,820
I'm not talking nonsense.

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,410
Your brother and I
have kept this secret for you

67
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,410
all these years.

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,820

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,220
Now it's time you paid us back.

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,780
Shut up.

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,610
The authorities have closed the case.

The Chen family was killed by bandits.

73
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,610
But do they know you're still alive?

74

was in and out of your pharmacy

76
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,500

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,380
Just shut up!

Fine, I'll keep quiet,

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,290
but only if you transfer all your money
to Chu Xiaobao,

80
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,820
or I'll go straight to the police.

81
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,980
Go on.

82
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,610
Or better yet, let's go together.

83
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,730
Let's see whether the police
take your murder case first,

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,730
or my defamation complaint against you.

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,500

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,940

93
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,170

What she said

98
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,930
was nothing but a wild guess.

99
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,980
Shaohua,

100
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,660
I truly understand

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,660
everything you've done,

102
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,100
for me, and for our family.

103
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,730
But...

104
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,100
Zhou Yan

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,370
is just the type of person

106
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,490
who will be like this forever.

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,700
I have no idea what to do with her.

108
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,700
You can do something about it.

109
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,410
All this time,

110
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,580
I've always told myself

111
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,810
that no matter what,

112
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,490
she's my wife

113
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,290
and Bao's mother.

114
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,340
She's been through so much with me,

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,980
and she gave our family a son.

116
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,610
How could I abandon her?

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,700
Shaozhong.

118
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,050
There's something else

119
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,250
I wanted to talk to you about.

120
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,410
Recently,

121
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,980
our inventory usage
has gone up all of a sudden,

122
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,250
and the numbers in the accounts
don't always add up.

123
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,780
We've got a discrepancy

124
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,250
of more than a hundred silver dollars
from the past quarter.

125
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,930
So I had Xue look into it,

126
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,900
and we found
that all the accounts with problems

127
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,460
were handled by Zhou Yan.

128
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,180
What a foolish woman.

129
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,620
Shaozhong,

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,300
I'll take care of this deficit,

131
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,260
but Zhou Yan

132
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,140
cannot work at Wen's Pharmacy.

133
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,140
Indeed.

134
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,660
I've decided.

135
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,380
She and I will resign together.

136
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,740
No.

137
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,220
This has nothing to do with you.

138
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,540
Everyone at Wen's Pharmacy

139
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,260
knows she and I are husband and wife.

140
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,700
Now that she's done something like this,

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
there's no way I can stay.

142
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,780
Only I, Xue,

143
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,300
and Mr. Wen know about this.

144
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,660
Forget it.

145
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,980
I can't even look you
in the eye anymore.

146
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,700
I'll take her and Bao

147
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,700
back to Qizhou.

148
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,900
Back to Qizhou?

149
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,420
You know there's nothing left.

150
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,060
How are you going to get by
if you return?

151
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,820
We'll see.

152
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,460
Shaozhong.

153
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,380
Don't bother.

154
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,740
Honestly, we should've left ages ago.

155
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,220
Shaohua,

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,580
just live your life, okay?

157
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,500
I'll handle Zhou Yan.

158
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,900
She's not going to be a problem.

159
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,300
Have you sorted things out with her?

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
I'm talking to you.

161
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,340
Why are you digging through
everything like that?

162
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,860
Packing up. We're going back to Qizhou.

163
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,820
Why go back now,
when everything's going well?

164
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,300
So you do know things are going well.

165
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,300
Why are you never satisfied

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,100
and always trying to pocket

167
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,380
other people's money?

168
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,460
Whose money did I take?

169
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,980
Didn't you ask Shaohua for money?

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,700
Wasn't that something
she should've offered anyway?

171
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,660
Why would she give it to you?

172
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,860
Because Bao's her nephew.

173
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,500
Cheng Hui isn't even family,

174
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,660
and he spends a ton of her money.

175
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,100
So what's the problem
if Bao uses a little?

176
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,340
Cheng Hui is her sworn brother.

177
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,700
Bao's her nephew.

178
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,340
Answer me.

179
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,060
Did you mess
with the storeroom accounts?

180
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,380
Is it true?

181
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,140
Who said that?

182
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,780
Who's slandering me?

183
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,260
Tell me. Or you find him.

184
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,860
We can go confront him, Shaozhong.

185
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,980
Enough, Zhou Yan.

186
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,020
Drop the act.

187
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,620
You're just being pigheaded.

188
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,140
You know better than anyone

189
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,340
whether you were wronged or not.

190
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,540
Chu Shaozhong,

191
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,940
are you siding with them against me?

192
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,860
You're really something.

193
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,940
Alright.

194
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,340
We're talking facts here.

195
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
Why are you crying?

196
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,220
Shaozhong,

197
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,420
after all these years with you,

198
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,660
don't you know me at all?

199
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,820
How could I possibly do
something like that?

200
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,620
Alright.

201
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,780
Bao's still asleep.

202
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,340
I know.

203
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,820
Shaozhong,

204
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,860
someone wants to force me out of here.

205
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,820
This is a setup.

206
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,740
Perhaps.

207
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,420
You have to back me up, understand?

208
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,420
Alright.

209
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,540
Stop crying.

210
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,100
No, you need to talk to Shaohua tomorrow

211
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,260
and clear this up.

212
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,980
I'm not going to be labeled

213
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,660
a thief for no reason.

214
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,100
I'll talk to Shaohua about it,

215
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,060
but we both have to

216
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,660
leave Wen's Pharmacy.

217
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,660
Why?

218
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,220
You've really crossed the line
with Shaohua.

219
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,260
How are we supposed to stay after that?

220
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,580
That's why you have to go to her.

221
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,060
The last time she wanted us to leave,

222
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,620
you went to her

223
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,100
and she changed her mind.

224
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,580
It's bound to work again.

225
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,780
I've told Shaohua

226
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,340
we're going back to Qizhou

227
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,180
and she won't hear from us again.

228
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,580
What nonsense are you talking about?

229
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,260
Also,

230
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,540
Shaohua has nothing to do
with the Chen family massacre.

231
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,740
Don't bring up that nonsense again.

232
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,620
Do you hear me?

233
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,020
That's not what you said back then.

234
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,260
What did I say?

235
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,060
You said Chu Shaohua

236
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,500
killed someone.

237
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,620
I wasn't thinking straight.

238
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
It was all nonsense.

239
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,380
Really?

240
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,220
Of course.

241
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,900
Start packing.

242
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,900
If you want to leave, go ahead.

243
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,060
I'm not going.

244
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,300
Back then, Chu Shaohua had nothing,

245
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,780
but she still managed
to make a name for herself.

246
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,860
So can I.

247
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,860
Mr. Wen,

248
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,820
what's up?

249
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,580
I've got some good news for you.

250
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,580
A cargo ship ran aground

251
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,020
on the shipping route
from Shanghai to Dalian.

252
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,260
No one was hurt,

253
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,660
but 18 dan of medicinal herbs

254
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,980
ended up at the bottom of the sea.

255
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
From Shanghai to Dalian?

256
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,420
Eighteen dan of medicine?

257
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,460
Was it the opium?

258
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,820
That's great news. Did our people do it?

259
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,740
It was Mr. Xia.

260
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,500
Him?

261
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,500
Didn't he flat-out refuse
to destroy them?

262
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,060
That's why we had to
find someone else to do it.

263
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,860
Maybe after talking with us,

264
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,180
he realized we were right.

265
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,380
It's good that he came around.

266
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,940
Then I guess we can keep
working with him.

267
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,260
Oh, right. I bought something from him.

268
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,620
What is it?

269
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,420
[Chichun Apothecary]

270
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,300
The sign of Chichun Apothecary.

271
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,820
Now it belongs to me.

272
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,580
How much

273
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
did he sell it to you for?

274
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,500
I'll give you double.

275
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,540
Double?

276
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,940
Your great-grandfather

277
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,220
founded this brand himself.

278
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,540
Double?

279
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,460
It should be at least ten times, right?

280
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,380
Ten times is fine too.

281
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,740
How much would that be?

282
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,260
It would be

283
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,460
ten silver dollars.

284
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,140
He sold it to you for one silver dollar?

285
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,860
Do you want it?

286
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,900
Yes.

287
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,140
If you're planning to hang up that sign

288
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,100
and open up in Shanghai,

289
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,180
I'd be happy to fund it.

290
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,340
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

291
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
But I'd still like to use
the money I earned myself

292
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,340
to hang up that sign and start again.

293
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,460
Oh, Mr. Wen.

294
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,740
Shouldn't I get a raise?

295
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,660
Didn't you just get one last year?

296
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,500
The pharmacy's income
goes up every year.

297
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,540
And so do the dividends.

298
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,700
They're not even in the same category.

299
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Don't lump them together.

300
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,540
Just raise both.

301
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,260
You're so greedy.

302
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,220
It's not like you just met me.

303
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,500
I'll give you the money tomorrow.

304
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,620
Thank you.

305
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,540
Welcome back.

306
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,780
What?

307
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,820
Good night.

308
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,220
Good night, Mr. Wen.

309
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,580
Don't forget about that raise.

310
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,140
What did you say?

311
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,380
A raise for both salary and dividends.

312
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,380
[Premium]

313
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,100
Mr. Xia.

314
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,220
The insurance company's compensation

315
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,340
has all been received.

316
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,580
Under the terms

317
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,900
of the total loss insurance agreement,

318
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,540
they compensated us
with 1.32 million silver dollars.

319
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,180
I still think it's a bit of a shame.

320
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,460
That batch of opium

321
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,620
could've brought in
1.5 million silver dollars.

322
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,900
But now,

323
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,620
after paying the insurance fees,

324
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,020
we've lost at least 200,000.

325
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,820
Keeping

326
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,020
Wen Zhiqiu and Chu Shaohua

327
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,540
on our side

328
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,180
is worth the cost.

329
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,060
That's true.

330
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,300
If that shipment
had really gone to Northeast China,

331
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,780
we'd be sharing the pot.

332
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,100
But now that million-plus

333
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,780
lands straight in our pockets.

334
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,220
Isn't that great?

335
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,300
No one handles the numbers like you do.

336
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
I'm just going with the flow.

337
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,860
After all, harmony brings wealth.

338
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,820
[Tian's Apothecary]

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,900

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,860

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,020
right,

and Chichun Apothecary.

347
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,500

Wen's Pharmacy?

355
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,100
Yes.

356
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,260
She said she used to work there
as a storekeeper,

357
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,500
and her husband was a pharmacist.

00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,780
that woman is a spy

364
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,860
from Wen's Pharmacy?

365
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,020
Are you stupid?

366
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,220
If she were a spy,

367
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,140
would she really just admit

she's from Wen's Pharmacy?

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,900
Yes, why not?

376
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,980
He sent someone to sniff around,

377
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,260
so why shouldn't I

378
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,980
get something out of her?

379
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,900
Use your head.

380
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,980
Mr. Tian.

381
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,980
Come in.

382
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,540
Mr. Tian.

383
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,220
You used to work at Wen's Pharmacy?

384
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,540
Yes.

385
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,860
Wen's Pharmacy offers the best pay

386
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,220
in the field.

387
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,580
Why did you leave?

388
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,540
Maybe the best pay isn't for everyone.

389
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,460
Those who brown-nose Chu Shaohua

390
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,060
get paid well for doing nothing.

391
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,220
Not everyone's got that knack.​

392
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,900
You strike me as someone

393
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,820
who is capable and talented,

394
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,140
but also a bit arrogant

395
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,300
and a bit hot-headed.

396
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,060
You're absolutely right, Mr. Tian.

397
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,620
You're truly remarkable.

398
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,180
That line was spot-on.

399
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,180
I don't want to

400
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,100
kiss up to Chu Shaohua,

401
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,300
and I've had enough of her attitude.

402
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,100
So I quit.

403
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,460
What's Chu Shaohua been doing?

404
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,020
Making money, as always.

405
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,580
I heard Wen's Pharmacy
is releasing a bunch of new drugs.

406
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,500
What kind of drugs?

407
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,460
I have no idea.

408
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,940
Just the usual ones.

409
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,820
Nothing special.

410
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,780
You're quite tight-lipped.

411
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,300
Alright.

412
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,580
No, Mr. Tian,

413
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,780
honestly, I have no idea.

414
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,140
I heard that Chu Shaohua

415
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,180
is very talented in business, isn't she?

416
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,420
Talented, my foot.

417
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,420
She only got into
the medicinal herbs business

418
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,060
because my husband brought her in.

419
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,020
Who is your husband?

420
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,460
Chu Shaohua's elder brother.

421
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,100
Mr. Tian, listen.

422
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,700
Chu Shaohua

423
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,060
is clueless

424
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,140
and ungrateful.

425
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,180
She's only still in business

426
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,580
by sheer luck.

427
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,660
I'm not like her.

428
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,060
I have what it takes.

429
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,020
I'm capable.

430
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,140
Just give me a chance,

431
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,340
and I'll work my tail off

432
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,100
for you here.

433
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,660
And I...

434
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,300
Get lost!

435
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,220
What's wrong?

436
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,620
You're obviously a spy
sent by Chu Shaohua.

437
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,780
And you've got the guts
to say you want to work for me?

438
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,940
Cut the nonsense out!

439
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,740
No.

440
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,340
Mr. Tian, you've misunderstood.

441
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,980
I have no connection to Chu Shaohua.

442
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,260
No connection? You've got some nerve.

443
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,940
You just said it yourself.

444
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,340
Your husband is her elder brother.

445
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,940
That makes you her sister-in-law.

446
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,660
You think she'd kick out her own family?

447
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,900
You think firing family is a big deal?

448
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,380
She murdered her own brother-in-law!

449
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,300
Seriously.

450
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,020
Get her out.

451
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,940
No, Mr. Tian,

452
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,220
I really have nothing to do with her.

453
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,780
Get out.

454
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,820
Cut the act. No one's buying it.

455
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,580
Go!

456
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,380
Mr. Tian.

457
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:21,940
Wait.

458
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,100
What did you just say?

459
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,220
I have no connection to Chu Shaohua.

460
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,260
Not that. I meant the next sentence.

461
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,820
Nothing.

462
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,740
Who did she murder?

463
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,140
I was just talking nonsense.

464
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,380
No.

465
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,820
Alright.

466
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,460
Who did she kill?

467
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,140
Who did she murder?

468
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,420
Mr. Wen, morning.

469
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,340
You really need

470
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,700
to check out the location

471
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,060
for the branch shops.

472
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,620
The contract with the Fujian merchants

473
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,100
has a few minor changes from last year.

474
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,060
But don't worry.

475
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,260
I've already marked everything.

476
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,100
It needs to go out today.

477
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Also, we need to finalize

478
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,580
next year's new product today.

479
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,980
The same goes for the budget.

480
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,260
We need a decision on that too.

481
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,540
By the way, where's the report

482
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,620
I gave you yesterday?

483
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,940
It's been 24 hours.

484
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,180
You can hand it over now.

485
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,220
Can I take a break?

486
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,940
No.

487
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,740
I'm counting on
this year's income to double.

488
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,980
That means better pay,

489
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,060
bigger dividends,

490
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,020
and Chichun Apothecary opening sooner.

491
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,580
Alright.

492
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,860
You're milking me to open your shop.

493
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,580
Mr. Wen, having an employee
willing to exploit you

494
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,500
is a blessing.

495
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,700
You should appreciate it.

496
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,580
Who is Chu Shaohua?

497
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,580
What are you doing?

498
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,460
You can't just barge in.

499
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,820
Who are you looking for?

500
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,380
Who is Chu Shaohua?

501
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,140
I am Chu Shaohua. What's wrong?

502
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,980
You are Chu Shaohua?

503
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,140
Is everything okay, officer?

504
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm the boss here.

505
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,740
Arrest that woman!

506
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,740
Why?

507
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,740
- Move aside!
- Get in the way,

508
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,660
and you'll be arrested too.

509
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,540
Mr. Jiang, why are you arresting her?

510
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,220
Zhiqiu.

511
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,100
Move aside.

512
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,100
Get out of the way.

513
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,020
Don't you move.

514
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,060
Go.

515
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,820
No need to drag me.

516
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,380
I'll go with you.

517
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,180
Did you report Shaohua?

518
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,660
Seriously.

519
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,180
I just had this qipao made.

520
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,300
Did the police take Shaohua away

521
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,620
because of you?

522
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,540
Of course not.

523
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,140
So it wasn't you?

524
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,820
Alright, come on.

525
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Sit down.

526
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,820
Why are you so worked up?

527
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,580
Listen, this is serious.

528
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,380
Shaohua's arrest has nothing
to do with you, does it?

529
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,900
Stop worrying about her for a second.

530
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,580
Do you even care about me?

531
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
What's the matter?

532
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,340
Shaozhong, I've got a job

533
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,500
with a salary that's five times
what Wen's Pharmacy offers.

534
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,660
The boss even gave me
a settling-in allowance.

535
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,260
We're staying in Shanghai.

536
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,660
We can finally get a big house,

537
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,580
and Bao can go to school here.

538
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,420
What kind of job did you get?

539
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,420
They're

540
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,340
one of the top medicinal herb companies
in Shanghai.

541
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
And the boss said

542
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,220
he's making me a manager.

543
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,060
Oh, right.

544
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,140
He said if you're willing to go,

545
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,820
he'll set you up with a good position.

546
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,980
How is that possible?

547
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,060
Why not?

548
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm more than capable,

549
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,940
right?

550
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,380
Zhou Yan,

551
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,820
be honest with me.

552
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
Did you really sell out Shaohua's past

553
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,180
for money?

554
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,620
Does it matter

555
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,740
if I did or didn't?

556
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,100
Just answer me.

557
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,260
Did you do it?

558
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,740
You told me

559
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,060
Shaohua was behind the murder
of Chen Ershun's family.

560
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
I didn't lie.

561
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,220
You're ruining Shaohua!

562
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,780
Your sister hit me,

563
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,500
and now you're hitting me too?

564
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,460
Chu Shaozhong, all I've had is misery

565
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,300
since I married you.

566
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,340
We never had comfort,

567
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,620
not even the basics,

568
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,300
and I never once looked down on you.

569
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,380
And after all that,
you have the nerve to hit me?

570
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,980
You deserved that!

571
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,140
I deserved that?

572
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,620
You're the one who needs a good smack!

573
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,900
You couldn't even get rich
or make a name for yourself.

574
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,100
Now that I'm the one bringing in money,

575
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,500
you have the nerve to hit me?

576
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,620
What kind of money are you making?

577
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,700
You're profiting
from lies and betrayal!

578
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,780
And you call it making money?

579
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,220
You think I'm heartless now?

580
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,060
I gave you a son.

581
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,140
Was that the act of a cruel woman?

582
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,100
I cared for your mother
until her final breath.

583
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,900
Did I look like someone
without a conscience?

584
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,380
I cooked, cleaned,
and served you day and night.

585
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,460
Was that selfishness?

586
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,300
You got rich

587
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,620
with your sister's help,
and now I'm the villain?

588
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Zhou Yan, no matter what you did,

589
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,660
no matter how wrong it was,

590
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
I always let it go.

591
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,820
But hurting Shaohua,

592
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,660
my sister,

593
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,740
is where I draw the line.

594
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,220
If I stay silent,

595
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,500
I'd be turning my back
on my family and my values.

596
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,620
Get out of here!

597
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,580
Chu Shaozhong.

598
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,940
You'd better not regret this.​

599
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,660
Get out!

600
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,900
The police are still investigating.

601
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,980
All those tabloids care about

602
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,220
is selling headlines.

603
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,980
They smeared Shaohua
without a shred of evidence.

604
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,420
We can absolutely sue them
for defamation.

605
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,820
That's the last step.

606
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,460
First, let's figure out the whole story.

607
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,300
Mr. Lin.

608
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,700
The Beiyang government's archives show

609
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,380
at the scene
of the Huashun Apothecary fire,

610
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,900
three bodies were found,

611
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,700
Chen Ershun, his mother,

612
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,540
and Chen Xuan.

613
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,780
But

614
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,220
they had died

615
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,260
before the fire even started.

616
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,380
Chen Ershun and his mother
died from knife injuries.

617
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,780
Chen Xuan died of suffocation.

618
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,460
Is Shaohua mentioned in the archives?

619
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,340
Yes.

620
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,260
The archives state

621
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,900
Miss Chu was abducted by bandits

622
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,140
and died midway
by throwing herself off a cliff.

623
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,780
Therefore, no remains were found.

624
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,860
But over two years ago,

625
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,180
the leader of the Sanshou Gang, Ertu,

626
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:16,980
was arrested.

627
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,300
He confessed

628
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,740
they tried to kidnap her,

629
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,820
but things didn't go as planned.

630
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,900
Shaohua was taken off
by a panicked horse.

631
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,740
No one's seen her since.

632
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,580
What about the other three?

633
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,260
Ertu admitted

634
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,180
that they robbed

635
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,460
and set fire to the Huashun Apothecary

636
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,100
to avenge the humiliation
from many years ago,

637
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,140
when they failed
to rob Shaohua and her husband

638
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,580
and ended up being taken hostage by her.

639
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,700
But he denied killing those three.

640
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,700
However, the Patrol Police Station

641
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,340
was eager
to wrap up the case and take credit.

642
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,460
So they pinned the murders

643
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,820
of all three victims on Ertu.

644
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,340
Why was this case reopened?

645
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,020
It is said that someone reported

646
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,780
that Chu Shaohua was the real culprit

647
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,820
behind the Chen family massacre,

648
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,540
and they're ready to testify.

649
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,940
Who?

650
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,860
I haven't found out yet.

651
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,260
Do you have any news?

652
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,180
I asked a contact at the police station,

653
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,420
but they all said "no comment."

654
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,500
No comment?

655
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,820
I think it's a fabricated charge.

656
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,700
Shaohua did kill someone.

657
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,620
How are you holding up?

658
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,980
Erniu should have told you

659
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,700
what happened to me
ten years ago, right?

660
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,340
Miss Chu,

661
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,620
I don't care what happened back then,

662
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,220
but once you are in court,

663
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,460
you must not plead guilty.

664
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,460
If the judge presses you,

665
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,980
just say

666
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,980
it's been a long time

667
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,500
and you don't remember anymore.

668
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,940
In short,

669
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,700
leave the rest to me.

670
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,820
I'm confident I can clear your name.

671
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,180
Mr. Lin.

672
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,020
I don't want to defend myself with lies,

673
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,260
nor do I want to hide anything anymore.

674
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,780
It's been ten years.

675
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,380
This has to end.

676
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,500
How do you want to resolve it?

677
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,980
I want the truth heard

678
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,340
in court,

679
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,020
in front of everyone.

680
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,340
I'll accept

681
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,900
whatever judgment comes.

682
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,620
Things aren't as straightforward
as they seem.

683
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,020
Yes, Chen Ershun deserved to die.

684
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,860
Now the self-righteous

685
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,020
are all pointing fingers at you.

686
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,500
Plus, we've offended

687
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,940
plenty of people over the years,

688
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,700
and now, some of them might see this
as a chance to strike.

689
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,860
If you want to reveal
the truth of this case,

690
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,140
can you bear the consequences
of public opinion?

691
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,100
Miss Chu,

692
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,940
not every reporter

693
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,180
is after the truth.

694
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,100
Most

695
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,500
are drawn to scandal and bloodshed.

696
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,580
Nor does every member of the public

697
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,980
have a sense of justice in their hearts.

698
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,220
Some people only want lies and gossip.

699
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,380
From a trial strategy standpoint,

700
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,540
claiming that bandits
wiped out the family

701
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,540
is the most effective way to end this,

702
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,940
considering the current climate

703
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,700
and your personal reputation.

704
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,580
The case is being reopened

705
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,180
because the police found a new witness,

706
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,140
likely one of the bandits
from back then.

707
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,940
And a bandit's testimony

708
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,900
is simple to overturn in court.

709
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,380
As long as we hold firm

710
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,820
that the bandits killed the Chen family,

711
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,260
Mr. Lin is confident

712
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,900
he can get you

713
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
a full acquittal.

714
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,180
The new witness

715
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,940
is not a bandit.

716
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,660
It's Zhou Yan.

717
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:32,940
Zhou...

718
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,300
Who is Zhou Yan?

719
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,300
She's my sister-in-law.

720
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,260
Perhaps

721
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,500
she heard something from my brother.

722
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,780
This is a bit tricky.

723
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,300
It's fine.

724
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,580
I've made my decision.

725
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,180
Don't worry about it.

726
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,780
Go back.

727
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,540
Shaohua.

728
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,980
Whatever storms or challenges

729
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,300
I have to face...

730
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
I will endure them all.

731
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,180
Go back.

732
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,980
[Jujing Apothecary]

733
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,660
You mean

734
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,100
we should get rid of Zhou Yan?

735
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,500
Yes, once we get rid of her,

736
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,100
all the police charges can be dropped.

737
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,580
No.

738
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,740
If we use such methods
to get rid of Zhou Yan

739
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,020
and fail,

740
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,980
things will get out of hand.

741
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,460
Besides, Shaohua is revealing the truth

742
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,180
because she no longer wants to
live with the secret.

743
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,100
If we go through with this,

744
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,420
we'll only be putting more
on her shoulders.

745
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,260
What you said makes a lot of sense.

746
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,860
Then what should we do?

747
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,580
We can't just let Zhou Yan

748
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,900
slander Shaohua like this, can we?

749
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,900
Remember, we still have Chu Shaozhong.

750
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,060
Is this enough?

751
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:17,980
Yes.

752
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,980
You're just picking at the meat.

753
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,180
How about some greens?

754
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,900
Meat's all I want.

755
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,020
Mr. Wen.

756
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,740
Father, why are you back so late?

757
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,540
Mr. Wen showed up

758
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,940
right when I was starving.

759
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,660
I picked up some flatbread for you.

760
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,340
Bao, I need a moment with Mr. Wen.

761
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,460
Go play for a bit, alright?

762
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,420
Shaohua was arrested.

763
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,700
It's all my fault.

764
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,620
Where is Zhou Yan?

765
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,660
Can I talk to her?

766
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,180
I don't know.

767
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,620
She hasn't been back for days.

768
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,700
Mr. Wen,

769
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,700
Shaohua will be okay, right?

770
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,860
The authorities won't make her pay
with her life, right?

771
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
We don't know yet.

772
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,980
But the police have evidence
against her.

773
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,900
If you testify in court

774
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,580
and prove Zhou Yan is lying,

775
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,820
you might be able

776
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,180
to help your sister.

777
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,860
Actually, I came today

778
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
for something else.

779
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,500
Since you said you wanted to go back,

780
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,740
Shaohua arranged a severance payout.

781
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,700
This money should be enough

782
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,140
to start a small business
or buy some land back home.

783
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,300
She also set aside a sum for Bao,

784
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,260
with a special instruction

785
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,460
that no one is allowed to use it.

786
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,860
It's for his education
or to learn a trade.

787
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,100
Shaohua wanted to give it
to you herself.

788
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,460
Shaohua

789
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,980
has been the kindest to me

790
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,420
and the one I failed the worst.

791
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,620
Shaozhong, may I ask one more question?

792
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
Since Shaohua treated
your family so well.

793
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,140
Why would Zhou Yan do this to her?

794
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,580
All she cares about is money.

795
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,940
I bet the police gave her

796
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,980
a fat reward.

797
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,820
The police wouldn't offer a reward

798
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,060
for a closed case.

799
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,980
But she suddenly became rich.

800
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
And she also said

801
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,260
that she's now a manager

802
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,420
at one of Shanghai's
top medicinal herb companies.

803
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,140
She knows nothing about the business.

804
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,740
How could she possibly be a manager?

805
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,460
Her money must have come
from betraying Shaohua.

806
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,420
Shaozhong,

807
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,780
if you see Zhou Yan,

808
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,020
please try to persuade her.

809
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,660
Mr. Wen,

810
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
to be honest with you,

811
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,260
Zhou Yan is beyond saving.

812
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,100
But don't worry,

813
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,900
I will tell everything I saw

814
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,020
in court, truthfully.

815
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,380
And I will also tell the judge

816
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,940
that Zhou Yan
wasn't even there at the time.

817
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,980
Everything she said is fabricated.

818
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,260
[Tian's Apothecary]

819
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,300
So the top medicinal herb company

820
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,860
is Tian's Apothecary.

821
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Mr. Tian gave the money to Zhou Yan.

822
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,860
I was wondering why the police

823
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,260
were so efficient in handling the case

824
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,700
and made such a big deal out of it.

825
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,460
Turns out it was Mr. Tian,

826
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,820
which doesn't surprise me one bit.

827
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,980
Mr. Tian can buy off Zhou Yan,

828
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
and so can we.

829
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,060
It just depends on
who offers a higher price.

830
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,500
Since Shaozhong has agreed to testify,

831
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,420
Zhou Yan is no longer a concern.

832
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,380
Our highest priority right now

833
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,660
is to find a way
to counter Mr. Tian's interference.

834
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,740
Leave it to me.

835
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,140
I have some connections
at the Prosecution Office.

836
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,580
I'm not asking them to play favorites,

837
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,700
just to do their job fairly.

838
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,860
What are you up to?

839
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,940
How much money did Mr. Tian give you?

840
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
I don't understand what you're saying.

841
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,500
Your hair was done in a back alley,

842
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,340
your qipao is last year's style,

843
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,860
and your bag and shoes

844
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,220
are both second-hand.

845
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,660
That bracelet is made of glass

846
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,380
and your perfume isn't even imported.

847
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,700
Mr. Tian didn't give you much money,
did he?

848
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,740
None of your business.

849
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,540
Judging by your outfit,

850
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,700
I'd say Mr. Tian gave you
no more than 2000 silver dollars.

851
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,740
I'll give you 4000,

852
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,220
enough for a Max Factor lipstick,

853
00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940
a Louis Vuitton bag,

854
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,140
Parisian perfume, and Prada heels.

855
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,220
What do you think?

856
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,300
The condition is simple.

857
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,500
Don't talk nonsense

858
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,900
in court.

859
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,620
I've already offended Shaohua.

860
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,380
Now you want me to take on Tian too?

861
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,260
How am I supposed to survive
in Shanghai after that?

862
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,340
As long as Shaohua can be acquitted,

863
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,020
I'll give you another 2000,

864
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,580
enough for you to live
wherever you want,

865
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,380
even overseas.

866
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,740
Kang Erniu,

867
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,380
if Chu Shaohua were as generous as you,

868
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,740
none of this would have happened,

869
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:49,820
right?

870
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,540
Think before you speak

871
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,980
in court.

872
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,700
[Shanghai Public Court]
Your Honor,

873
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,380
these are the testimonies
of Wang Shuangxi and Song Dawei,

874
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,060
who used to work at Huashun Apothecary.

875
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,940
They confirm

876
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,820
that Chu Shaohua

877
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
was seeing a man

878
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,500
and had plans to elope with him
before the incident.

879
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,700
This is the testimony of Mrs. Song,

880
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,020
the sister of the deceased, Mrs. Chen.

881
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,100
She confirmed that before the incident,

882
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,260
Chu Shaohua's mother-in-law, Mrs. Chen,

883
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,140
strongly opposed her remarriage.

884
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,540
But she insisted on
going through with it,

885
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,180
and their relationship
had become extremely hostile.

886
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,100
Based on the evidence presented,

887
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,140
we have every reason to believe

888
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,620
that Chu Shaohua, in order to remarry,

889
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,860
murdered Mrs. Chen,
who opposed the marriage,

890

as well as Chen Ershun and Chen Xuan.

891
