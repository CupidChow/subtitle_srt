00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,370
enough to prove that Xia Yuan's contract

192
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,300
is a forgery.

193
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,850
That's great.

194
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,940
Mr. Xia.

195
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,540
[Shanghai Public Court]

196
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,220
Miss Chu,

197
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,260
you can still change your mind.

198
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,420
Mr. Xia.

199
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,260
Truth doesn't change,

200
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,860
and lies won't hold up.

201
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,500
Once we're in court,

202
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,180
the Miracle Pill's as good as mine.

203
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,100
Your Honor,

204
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,300
based on the witnesses, testimonies,
and evidence presented,

205
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
[Plaintiff]
we request a ruling

206
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,140
that Shaohua Pharmaceuticals

207
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,890
[Defendant]
return the Miracle Pill formula

208
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,980
to Shouyuan Apothecary.

209
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,860
All prior profits

210
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,940
from its sale

211
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,220
should also be returned.

212
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,940
Defense Lawyer,

213
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,100
do you have any arguments to present

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,060
regarding the plaintiff's
evidence and claims?

215
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,020
Your Honor,

216
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,740
the sales contract submitted
by the plaintiff

217
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,820
is forged.

218
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
You need evidence to support that.

219
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,340
Defense Lawyer,

220
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,460
do you have any evidence
to support your statement?

221
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Your Honor,

222
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,980
the submitted contract states:

223
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,100
"Empty words prove nothing.

224
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,620
This sales contract is the evidence,

225
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,820
issued in triplicate.

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,260
One copy each is held by the signatory,

227
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,060
the contract holder, and Anke Hall."

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,540
While the signatory's copy
is no longer available,

229
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,020
we have located

230
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,500
the original contract

231
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,900
in the Qizhou Anke Hall archives.

232
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,340
Please note

233
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,940
that while the two contracts
are very similar,

234
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,940
the copy archived by Anke Hall

235
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,740
does not contain the phrase

236
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,420
"Miracle Pill formula."

237
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,500
Since the relevant parties
are either missing

238
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,580
or have passed away,

239
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,980
comparatively,

240
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,940
the copy archived by Anke Hall

241
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,580
is more credible.

242
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
Your Honor,

243
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,940
we request a thorough review

244
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,420
of the defendant's evidence.

245
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,540
Your Honor,

246
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,980
it's the defendant's contract

247
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,740
that's forged.

248
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,620
You need evidence to support that.

249
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,140
The signatures and fingerprints
of Xia Yuan and Gao Qianyi

250
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,300
are not theirs at all.

251
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,060
If you keep talking nonsense,

252
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,940
I swear I'll knock you out.

253
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,900
Of the six people who left fingerprints,

254
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,620
three have passed away,

255
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,740
and one is missing.

256
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,900
But Xia Yuan and Gao Qianyi
are still alive,

257
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,420
and present in this courtroom.

258
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,180
We request

259
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,900
immediate fingerprint verification.

260
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,140
Sure, do it.

261
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,220
We'll see who's bluffing.

262
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,380
No one came for over a decade.

263
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,700
Then there were two visits this month.

264
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
How strange.

265
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Miss Chu, do you agree
to the on-site identification?

266
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,780
No need.

267
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,780
Why?

268
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,380
We've been tricked.

269
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,900
What do you mean?

270
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,740
The contract we brought back

271
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,180
from Anke Hall

272
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,180
is a forgery.

273
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,940
How is that possible?

274
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,180
Looks like Xia Yuan

275
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,860
placed a fake contract

276
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,220
in the archives,

277
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,740
hoping we'd fall for it.

278
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,540
Your Honor,

279
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,540
we do not agree
to the on-site identification.

280
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,260
Feeling guilty, are you?

281
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,700
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

282
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,740
we request a brief recess.

283
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,860
That won't do,

284
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,060
unless you acknowledge
the evidence was forged.

285
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,180
Order.

286
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,980
Witness Gao Qianyi,
please take the stand.

287
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,820
Witness,

288
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,820
please state your identity.

289
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,340
My name is Gao Qianyi,

290
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,780
and I am the second shopkeeper
of Shouyuan Apothecary.

291
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,460
Present the evidence.

292
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,620
Take his fingerprints.

293
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,620
Your Honor,

294
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,820
even without collecting fingerprints,

295
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
we can still determine

296
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,020
the contract submitted by Miss Chu

297
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,340
is evidently forged.

298
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,060
There's a whorl fingerprint
on the contract,

299
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,060
but all my fingers have loop patterns.

300
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,100
Mr. Xia's contract

301
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,940
does contain my fingerprint.

302
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,500
But

303
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,580
his copy

304
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,420
is also fake.

305
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,100
I stamped it myself

306
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,060
twenty days ago.

307
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,300
And I remember

308
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,980
that the contract back then

309
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,860
didn't mention the Miracle Pill at all.

310
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,780
Gao Qianyi, you ungrateful wretch!

311
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,740
Save it for later.

312
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,620
Mr. Gao, thank you.

313
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,620
I truly didn't expect

314
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,900
that you would come to my defense

315
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,860
at the most crucial moment.

316
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,220
Actually,

317
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,740
Xia Yuan's tactics
in acquiring Chichun Apothecary

318
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,660
were nothing short of despicable.

319
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,700
If he were to seize the Miracle Pill
in the same ruthless way,

320
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,020
that would be downright unjust.

321
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,980
I couldn't just stand by,

322
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,340
so I chose to speak out.

323
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,340
When my family sold
Chichun Apothecary to Xia Yuan,

324
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,540
it was out of desperation,

325
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,980
but the decision was still our own.

326
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,140
Miss Chu, as you know,

327
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,620
back then, Shouyuan Apothecary

328
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,780
dealt exclusively
in wholesale raw medicinal materials.

329
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,500
Back in 1916,

330
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,620
Xia Yuan sought to enter
the prepared medicine market,

331
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,300
so he set his sights on acquiring

332
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,740
the century-old Chichun Apothecary.

333
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,460
But your brother flat-out refused.

334
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,460
At the same time,

335
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,260
the Guandong and Qizhou Trade Guilds

336
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,740
were locked in a years-long struggle

337
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,580
to control pricing power
in the Qizhou Medicine Market

338
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,100
with neither side
gaining the upper hand.

339
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,940
So Xia Yuan devised a plan

340
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,980
that served both his ambitions.

341
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,500
He first had Yi Dajin use fake Huangqi

342
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,820
to replace the genuine stock
held by the Guandong Trade Guild,

343
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,740
damaging their reputation and business
in the process.

344
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,140
Then he arranged for someone

345
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,260
to resell that original batch of Huangqi

346
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,740
to your brother.

347
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,540
That was quicker than expected.

348
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,820
Later, under the guise
of assisting the investigation,

349
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,460
he caught your brother in the act

350
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,500
and handed him over to Mr. Yang
to deal with.

351
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,260
That gave him leverage over Mr. Yang.

352
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
Meanwhile, your brother,

353
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
in order to purchase
all the genuine Huangqi,

354
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,980
took on loan shark debt,

355
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,140
which ultimately forced your family

356
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,380
to hand over Chichun Apothecary to him.

357
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,900
So...

358
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,420
it was Xia Yuan all along.

359
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,220
Precisely.

360
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,020
However, there was
an interesting side story to this.

361
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,620
Yi Dajin

362
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,460
had originally planned for Wu

363
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,220
to expose the Guandong Trade Guild
for selling fake Huangqi.

364
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,860
But when it was time for him to testify,

365
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,860
he vanished.

366
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,660
In the end, it was you
who uncovered the fake Huangqi

367
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
and brought the truth to light.

368
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,380
Thanks to that,

369
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,180
Shaozhong was later released

370
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,060
by Mr. Yang.

371
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,940
Wu, however, was penalized

372
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,700
with a six-month salary deduction.

373
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,940
Resentful,

374
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,140
he fled with a sum of money.

375
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,140
And just like that, Erniu's fate

376
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,420
was rewritten.

377
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,340
I should board the ship now.

378
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,620
What are your plans moving forward?

379
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,580
None, really.

380
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,020
After years of being entangled
in business power plays,

381
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,740
I'm truly exhausted.

382
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,660
Coming home feels like
the right moment to breathe.

383
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,700
Miracle Pill was saved,

384
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,580
but it cost you your job.

385
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm truly sorry.

386
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,380
You don't need to feel guilty.

387
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,500
Honestly, I'd long planned
to leave Xia Yuan.

388
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,340
It's just

389
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,940
I couldn't bring myself
to break the loyalty I felt,

390
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,580
or the respect I owed him as a mentor.

391
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,860
And of course,

392
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,820
I wasn't quite ready
to give up the paycheck.

393
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,140
It wasn't until that moment in court

394
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,220
that I finally made up my mind.

395
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
Why was that?

396
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,620
Miss Chu, as you know,

397
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,980
the Japanese are now

398
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,460
shareholders in Shouyuan Apothecary.

399
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,660
If the Miracle Pill formula

400
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,940
ends up in Shouyuan's hands,

401
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,740
it would inevitably

402
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,940
fall into theirs as well.

403
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,540
I may be an ordinary man,

404
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,220
but when it comes
to national interest and justice,

405
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,140
I stand firm.

406
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,580
Mr. Gao,

407
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,860
you have my deepest respect.

408
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,980
Please don't.

409
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,460
Whenever you're ready to return,

410
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,540
you'll always have a place

411
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,100
at Chichun Apothecary.

412
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,300
Miss...

413
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Ms. Chu.

414
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,700
We shall meet again.

415
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,060
Farewell.

416
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,580
Here's your wonton.

417
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,420
Thank you.

418
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,940
She always goes on Wednesday evenings

419
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,500
to the stall by Kongjia Longtang

420
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,380
to eat a bowl of wontons.

421
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,780
By herself?

422
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,820
Yes.

423
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,140
I checked it out.

424
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,580
That intersection is quiet at night,

425
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,860
making it easy to make a move.

426
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,260
Mr. Xia, things have been sensitive.

427
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,780
Is that so?

428
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,780
Two days ago, Chiang Kai-shek

429
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,100
published an article

430
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,340
in the Japanese magazine
Economic Exchange.

431
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,660
In it, he wrote:

432
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,780
"China's concessions
and compromises to Japan

433
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,700
do have certain limits."

434
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,100
Furthermore,

435
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,460
he instructed the Ambassador
to Japan, Chiang Tso-pin,

436
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,340
to inform our government

437
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,900
that should the Chinese government

438
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,620
be pushed beyond endurance,

439
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,940
it will resist the aggressors

440
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,980
at all costs.

441
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,460
Didn't he use to take

442
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,100
a strictly non-confrontational approach?

443
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,980
But recently,

444
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,660
in politics, military affairs,

445
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,380
national defense, diplomacy, and beyond,

446
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,980
he's been quietly maneuvering.

447
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,100
It seems his stance has shifted.

448
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,140
Is he really preparing for war?

449
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,060
I doubt it.

450
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,980
But given how things are now,

451
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,940
he might not have a choice.

452
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,860
I believe

453
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,740
the war between China and Japan

454
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,700
is inevitable.

455
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,780
You must hurry

456
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,500
and secure what we want

457
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,660
before war breaks out.

458
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,580
Alright.

459
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,420
I'll make the arrangements.

460
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,660
That's the situation with Marketing.

461
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,220
What about your side?

462
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,380
It's about the new factory site.

463
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,220
We had a good plot of land all set,

464
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,420
and we were just about to sign

465
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,980
when the owner suddenly pulled out.

466
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,540
I asked around,

467
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,820
and it turns out they got threatened
by some officials.

468
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,660
Ma Juncai's guys?

469
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,900
Probably.

470
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,900
Why not look elsewhere?

471
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,580
I think

472
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Southwest China seems promising.

473
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,780
We don't have to stay tied
to Shanghai or Nanjing.

474
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,140
I'll get on it right away.

475
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,380
Okay.

476
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,420
Great work today, everyone.

477
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,700
Let's call it a day.

478
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,020
Go home and get some rest.

479
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,540
Shaohua,

480
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,220
heading straight home later?

481
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm craving a bowl of wontons
before I go.

482
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,740
I'll come with you.

483
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,900
Don't you usually skip supper

484
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
to keep your figure?

485
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,340
I just felt like having some today.

486
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,420
You usually go alone,

487
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,340
but tonight, I'm joining you.

488
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,540
Alright.

489
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,140
Cheng Hui, you coming?

490
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,780
I need to head to the factory later.

491
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,540
I'll pass.

492
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,220
You two go ahead.

493
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,660
Alright, we're off.

494
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,300
Oh, and Shaohua,

495
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,540
watch yourself, alright?

496
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,100
Okay.

497
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,220
Don't worry, I'm here.

498
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,420
It's right there.

499
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,460
Pretty packed today.

500
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,460
Go take a seat.

501
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,940
Excuse me,

502
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,620
two bowls of wontons.

503
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,340
Alright.

504
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,180
Is something wrong?

505
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,260
Feels like someone's been
keeping an eye on me.

506
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
Could it be Ma Juncai's guys?

507
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,380
Hard to say.

508
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,660
Thank you.

509
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,100
Did they send

510
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,900
those three bullets?

511
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,620
Those guys

512
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,940
love using scare tactics.

513
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,540
I heard Yang Xingfo and Shi Liangcai

514
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,980
were both killed by them.

515
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,980
Shaohua,

516
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,940
I'm afraid they'll lay a hand on you.

517
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,700
Thank you.

518
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,980
Let's finish up quickly

519
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,340
and get going.

520
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,620
Be extra careful these days

521
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,020
and try not to go out alone.

522
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,700
I'll go add some cilantro.

523
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,220
Okay.

524
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,820
Sir, I'd like more cilantro.

525
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,460
Alright, help yourself.

526
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,020
Okay.

527
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,500
Shaohua, watch out!

528
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,900
Erniu!

529
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,220
Erniu!

530
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,100
Erniu!

531
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,180
Erniu!

532
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,740
Erniu!

533
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,820
Erniu!

534
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,580
Hurry! Get a ride!

535
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:45,980
Okay.

536
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,180
Erniu, hang in there.

537
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,260
Shaohua,

538
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,020
I've actually been shot.

539
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,740
It hurts so much.

540
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,780
I'm taking you to the hospital.

541
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,660
Ouch.

542
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,660
Hang in there.

543
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,380
[Operating Room]

544
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,460
Doctor.

545
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,780
Good thing it missed anything vital.

546
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,660
Don't worry.

547
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,420
You're awake.

548
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,220
Where am I?

549
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:57,980
The hospital.

550
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,500
The doctor just operated on you.

551
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,260
The bullet has been removed.

552
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,500
I can't believe they actually fired.

553
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,100
Thankfully, you're alright.

554
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,340
The doctor said you lost a lot of blood

555
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,620
and need proper rest.

556
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,500
Are you alright?

557
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,740
I'm fine.

558
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,060
But you almost...

559
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
You knew

560
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,580
they were going to kill me.

561
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,900
Why did you run toward them?

562
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,820
Why didn't you dodge?

563
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,060
If it were you,

564
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,940
you'd have done the same,

565
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,460
wouldn't you?

566
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,620
I don't know.

567
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,020
I'm not as brave as you.

568
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,980
I'm not brave.

569
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,300
I just

570
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,860
don't want to lose you.

571
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,580
Erniu.

572
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,460
Thank you.

573
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,500
We don't do formalities,

574
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,380
do we?

575
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,100
You can go get the medicine now.

576
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,140
Get some more rest.

577
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,460
I'll get it for you.

578
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,900
Shaohua.

579
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,260
I just meant to scare her!

580
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,540
Why'd you actually shoot?

581
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,820
I didn't think the other woman

582
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,500
would be so fierce.

583
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,020
She even tried to grab my gun,

584
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,620
and it went off by accident.

585
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,580
You told me

586
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,940
Chu Shaohua was usually there
by herself!

587
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,580
But last night, there was another woman.

588
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,660
I told you to handle it fast and clean,

589
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,540
without a fuss,

590
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,140
but you still managed
to mess everything up!

591
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,500
Mr. Ma, how about we try again?

592
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,300
No need.

593
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,180
This should be enough to send a message.

594
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,940
As for what happens next...

595
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,180
I'll take care of

596
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,940
the Patrol Office myself.

597
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,900
You guys,

598
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,020
lay low for a few days.

599
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

600
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,540
Get lost.

601
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,900
Hello, Chi...

602
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Miss Chu, this is Ma Juncai.

603
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,660
Mr. Ma,

604
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,420
is there something you need?

605
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,900
I heard
your Deputy General Manager, Miss Bai,

606
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,380
was caught in a robbery

607
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,300
and was shot.

608
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,620
I'm calling to send my regards.

609
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,300
You are indeed well-informed.

610
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,940
The robbers didn't

611
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,900
happen to tell you that, did they?

612
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,540
I heard it from the Patrol Office.

613
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,900
You know,

614
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,580
I have a good relationship
with the Patrol Office.

615
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,980
They'll back me up,
no matter how serious it gets.

616
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,620
Are you saying

617
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,220
you can do whatever you want
and get away with it?

618
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,460
No.

619
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
What I mean is,

620
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,820
things aren't safe out there.

621
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,140
You need to be extra careful

622
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,660
when you go out,

623
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,260
especially when you're walking alone
at night,

624
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,020
and try not to carry anything valuable.

625
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,020
People get targeted
not for who they are,

626
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,940
but for what they have.

627
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,380
If you were to run into robbers again,

628
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,900
you could

629
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
lose your life.

630
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,780
Ma Juncai,

631
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,820
tell whoever you answer to

632
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,860
that even if I lose my life,

633
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,220
I will never yield.

634
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,420
Should you reconsider

635
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,380
our collaboration, Miss Chu,

636
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,860
please do not hesitate to contact me.

637
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,900
I tolerated seeing
you and Bai Bingxin together

638
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,020
all the time.

639
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,900
You made me throw all shame aside,

640
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,580
create a scene,

641
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,540
and drive her away.

642
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,500
I did that too.

643
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,980
I can't believe

644
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
you would kick me out

645
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,060
and even abandon

646
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
your own kids.

647
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,380
Why?

648
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,980
I have my plans.

649
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,620
They're

650
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,900
all about money, aren't they?

651
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,220
Shufen,

652
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,340
in this world,

653
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,660
you don't have to trust anyone,

654
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,180
not even me.

655
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,260
But you must trust money.

656
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,460
The money I gave you

657
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,340
is more than enough for you
and our children

658
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,540
to live out your days in comfort.

659
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,500
Yes.

660
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,780
That's the only thing you left behind.

661
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,980
Thank you for understanding.

662
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,300
Understanding?

663
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,340
I've just seen through it all.

664
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,820
All these years,

665
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,940
you've never loved me.

666
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
You married me back then

667
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,020
only because

668
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,700
I had a generous dowry.

669
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
I've worked hard for decades,

670
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,500
but in your eyes,

671
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,780
I was nothing more than

672
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,420
a maid for your parents,

673
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,820
a housekeeper for your affairs,

674
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,100
and a vessel to bear your children.

675
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,700
Not entirely.

676
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,940
We are family.

677
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,260
Well, it's all over now.

678
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,820
After years of serving this family,

679
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,700
now

680
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,180
I can finally live for myself.

681
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,660
Thank you.

682
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,420
Shufen.

683
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,420
Take good care of our children

684
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,540
and yourself.

685
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,380
Make sure you hold on to that money.

686
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,700
You're on your own now. Good luck.

687
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,980
[Public Shanghai Hospital]

688
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,820
You don't need to help me walk.

689
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,620
I'm feeling much better today.

690
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,460
Shaohua.

691
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,860
I came to check on you.

692
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,180
You look much better than yesterday.

693
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,780
Yes,

694
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
the doctor said
I can be discharged tomorrow.

695
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,740
You can get to work.
I'll keep her company.

696
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,220
Okay.

697
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,740
I can't wait

698
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,020
to go back to work.

699
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,900
I've been going stir-crazy.

700
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,540
Erniu,

701
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,180
you can't go back yet.

702
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,780
Why not?

703
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,660
I need to lay low too.

704
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,900
What's wrong?

705
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,020
The Patrol Office has closed the case

706
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,940
on your shooting incident.

707
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,100
They claimed it was a random robber.

708
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,180
How could they close it like that?

709
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,540
It was obviously Ma Juncai's men.

710
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,060
He didn't even bother to cover it up.

711
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,060
He threatened me outright.

712
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,700
If I don't cooperate,

713
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,460
they won't stop
until they get what they want.

714
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,380
It seems they are determined

715
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,580
to get the Miracle Pill formula.

716
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:45,900
Erniu,

717
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,900
you took a bullet for me this time.

718
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,940
Otherwise,

719
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,820
I might not have made it.

720
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,580
But

721
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,620
next time, I might not be

722
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,700
so lucky.

723
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,500
Let's take them to court.

724
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
With a world this wide,

725
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,340
there has to be somewhere

726
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,620
we can still find justice.

727
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,780
Erniu,

728
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,780
I'm afraid I won't live to see the day

729
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,300
justice is served.

730
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,380
Don't talk nonsense.

731
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,420
I'm not afraid to die.

732
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,620
What scares me is that once I'm gone,

733
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,220
the Miracle Pill might be lost forever.

734
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,260
Shaohua,

735
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,580
you'll be fine.

736
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,620
Erniu,

737
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,900
you're the one I trust most

738
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,100
in this world.

739
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,660
So please,

740
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,220
I have a favor to ask.

741
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,900
Go ahead.

742
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,900
I made a backup
of the Miracle Pill formula.

743
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,380
I want to leave it in your care.

744
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,020
Leave it with me?

745
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,340
Can I really trust you?

746
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,500
Of course you can.

747
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,540
Then you have to promise me two things.

748
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,500
First,

749
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,700
don't open this envelope

750
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,860
until after I'm gone.

751
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,500
Second,

752
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,860
once you have the formula,

753
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,580
help me keep the Miracle Pill

754
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,140
alive and thriving.

755
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,020
Maybe you shouldn't

756
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,780
give me the Miracle Pill formula.

757
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:28,980
What's wrong?

758
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,540
I don't feel like I deserve it.

759
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,740
Erniu.

760
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
Deep down,

761
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,540
I believe you're the right person.

762
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,300
We grew up side by side,

763
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,940
and we've been through so much together.

764
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,260
What we share

765
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,900
is more than trust.

766
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,420
It's a bond forged
through life and death.

767
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,540
That's why I feel much more at ease

768
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,180
leaving the Miracle Pill in your hands.

769
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,740
Are you sure?

770
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,100
Absolutely.

771
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,460
Alright.

772
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,940
I just hope

773
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,740
I never have to open this envelope.

774
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,620
That would be for the best.

775
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
Whatever happens to me down the road,

776
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,740
I can face it with peace of mind now.

777
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,300
Shaohua,

778
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,020
you've got luck on your side.

779
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,140
You'll be fine.

780
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,980
Right, I need to take care of something
at Chichun Apothecary.

781
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,860
I should get going.

782
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,980
Okay, go ahead.

783
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,900
See you tomorrow.

784
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,100
See you tomorrow.

785
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,580
It's me.

786
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,020
I got it.
