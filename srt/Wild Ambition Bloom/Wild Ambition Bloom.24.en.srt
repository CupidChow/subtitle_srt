throw yourself into the river

151
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,020

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,380

without a second thought.

188
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,780
So tell me. Who's truly immoral here?

189
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,900
Me

190
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,060
or people like you?

191
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,620
Bai Bingxin, you...

192
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Shut up! Sit down!

193
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,780
Exactly!

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Someone like you

195
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,860
doesn't deserve to be a reporter at all.

196
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,940
What kind of person is that?

197
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,060
- Exactly!
- A disgrace to reporters.

198
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
Such a shame.

199
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,020
Sun.

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,780
I'm Sun Longyin from Xintian News.

201
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,660
Let me say a few words.

202
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,060
I believe Miss Bai's past

203
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
is not a stain on her character.

204
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,300
She walked through the shadows,

205
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,540
refused to fall,

206
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,900
fought her way back,

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,060
and stood tall on her own.

208
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,780
She's given us

209
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,100
so many unforgettable moments on screen.

210
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,260
In my opinion,

211
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,020
Miss Bai

212
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,220
is a strong,

213
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,180
graceful, compassionate,
and truly remarkable woman.

214
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,140
- Good!
- Splendid!

215
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,020
Well said!

216
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,060
Dear members of the press,

217
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,220
we have an important update

218
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,340
regarding Miss Bai Bingxin

219
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,820
that we'd like to share with you.

220
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,700
Please welcome the representative
from Jujing Apothecary.

221
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,980
[Bai Bingxin's Press Conference]

222
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
On behalf of Jujing Apothecary,
I'm pleased to announce

223
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,820
that we are officially
inviting Miss Bai Bingxin

224
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,980
to serve as the spokesperson
for our new product Bingyu Balm.

225
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
- Great!
- Good!

226
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,340
May I ask, what led to your decision

227
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,140
to invite Miss Bai Bingxin

228
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,380
as your spokesperson?

229
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,940
That's an excellent question.

230
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,780
Firstly,

231
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,460
Miss Bai Bingxin's name

232
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,340
pairs beautifully with Bingyu Balm.

233
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,380
Secondly,

234
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,020
her exceptional beauty

235
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,020
and graceful presence

236
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,220
perfectly reflect
the premium image of our brand.

237
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,460
Most importantly,

238
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,140
her strength shines through adversity,

239
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,900
and her character is truly admirable.

240
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,820
Our staff truly hold her in respect.

241
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,780
This is our way

242
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,100
of showing support for Miss Bai Bingxin.

243
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,140
Thank you.

244
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,820
- Good!
- Great!

245
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,220
On behalf of Xintian News,

246
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,900
I urge all fellow journalists

247
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
to stand with Bai Bingxin

248
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,460
and push back
against toxic forces like Wu

249
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,620
all the way to the end.

250
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,180
- Good!
- Well said!

251
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,500
I'm from Damai News.

252
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,380
On behalf of Damai News,

253
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,660
we will speak out for justice!

254
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,060
- Good!
- Great!

255
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Miss Bai, don't be afraid of them.

256
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,300
You have our support!

257
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,620
- Yes, we support you!
- We're with you!

258
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,780
- So do we!
- Yes!

259
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,260
Thank you.

260
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,020
I want to thank everyone.

261
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,620
Before today,

262
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
every single day

263
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,740
felt like walking on a tightrope.

264
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
I was terrified Wu would find me,

265
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,180
or that I'd be recognized

266
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,940
by the madam, or even the customers.

267
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,540
But what I feared still happened.

268
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,260
Honestly,

269
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,380
just a few days ago,

270
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
I wanted to die.

271
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,180
Because apart from death,

272
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,100
I truly saw no other way out.

273
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,780
But today,

274
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,940
everything is different.

275
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,300
Thank you all.

276
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,020
- Good!
- Great!

277
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,420
Because of

278
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,380
your support,

279
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm no longer the Kang Erniu

280
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,460
who was bullied and controlled.

281
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm no longer Lu Ningxiang,

282
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,820
the woman who was humiliated
and too afraid to fight back.

283
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,900
Today, I stand here.

284
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,220
I won't hide. I won't flinch.

285
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,540
Throw all the dirt you want.

286
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,060
I'm not afraid anymore,

287
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,060
and I will never fall.

288
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,420
- Good!
- Great!

289
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,820
- Good!
- Well said!

290
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,140
We did it.

291
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,420
Good job.

292
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
What's going on?

293
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,540
Why are all the newspapers
speaking up for Bai Bingxin?

294
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,060
I heard that yesterday, Bai Bingxin

295
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,340
held a press conference,

296
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,980
and it instantly shifted public opinion
in her favor.

297
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,580
Really?

298
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,380
[Tian's Apothecary]

299
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,140
Morning, Mr. Tian.

300
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,020
Make every corner spotless.

301
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,260
Morning, Mr. Tian.

302
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,220
Have you heard?

303
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,500
Bai Bingxin is even more popular
than Liang Shanshan!

304
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,060
You haven't read today's newspaper,
have you?

305
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,860
It says

306
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
the film company is going to custom-make

307
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
three movies just for her!

308
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,420
- Three?
- Three?

309
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,180
That's right.

310
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,260
Three.

311
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,420
It's a pity

312
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,740
that Second Mr. Tian broke up with her,

313
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,500
or

314
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,660
we might've shared
a bit of her spotlight.

315
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,580
Exactly.

316
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,100
Yeah.

317
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,220
What are you all chatting about?

318
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,900
Is it really that interesting?

319
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,140
You should be working, not gossiping!

320
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,900
When the customers arrive,

321
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,260
if this place's still a mess,

322
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,260
you'll see

323
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,660
how I deal with each one of you!

324
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,460
Stupid and lazy.

325
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,620
Mind your tongue.

326
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Come here.

327
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,380
Throw all these papers out.

328
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,820
These are today's newspapers.

329
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,780
Do as I say.

330
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,260
But we need to lay out fresh papers

331
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,020
for the guests every day.

332
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,700
Just throw them away.

333
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
- Cut the nonsense off.
- Alright.

334
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,900
I'll do it now.

335
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,620
Did you hear that? Get rid of them.

336
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,460
Where's Wu?

337
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,460
Still at Tongjiang Inn.

338
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,540
Yi is with him.

339
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,860
Send him away.

340
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,380
Mr. Tian,

341
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,580
you said you'd give him another payment.

342
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,380
Are you still gonna pay?

343
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,740
Yes.

344
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,940
Feel free to cover it yourself.

345
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,540
Fool.

346
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,020
No.

347
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
I'll cover the charges up to today.

348
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,460
If you plan to stay longer,

349
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,060
you'll have to pay for it yourself.

350
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,260
What do you mean?

351
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,180
So, you're kicking me out?

352
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,260
Believe what you want.

353
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,860
Anyway, I'm done here.

354
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,300
Fine.

355
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,380
I'll go,

356
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:01,860
but you need to give me the money.

357
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,980
Mr. Tian promised me

358
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,380
another payment.

359
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,500
As long as I get it,

360
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,180
I'll leave right away.

361
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,900
Things ended up like this,

362
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,900
and you still have the nerve
to ask for money?

363
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,700
What does that have to do with me?

364
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,780
I did everything you told me to.

365
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,860
You can

366
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,260
forget about getting any money.

367
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,980
So you're breaking your word, huh?

368
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,780
Fine.

369
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,380
Then I'm not leaving.

370
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,900
Wu, if I were you,

371
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,660
I'd pack up and leave

372
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,100
before Mr. Tian gets angry.

373
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,780
If he changes his mind

To Tianjin?

384
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,540
Then why are you taking the train?

385
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,260
The water route's way faster.

386

There's a river route?

there's a direct line by water
from Shanghai to Tianjin.

390
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,780
It only takes three or four days
to get there.

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,380
Thank you, Wen Zhiqiu.

749
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,860
Thank you for being so thoughtful

750
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,140
towards Shaohua.

751
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,020
After all this time,

752
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,300
there's finally someone

753
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,780
who values Shaohua

754
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,340
and genuinely cares for her.

755
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,300
You must do well later.

756
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,460
Although Shaohua is very independent,

757
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,380
with you around her,

758
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,380
I feel reassured.

759
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,500
Okay, got it.

760
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,980
Thank you.

761
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,900
Give it a try.

762
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
Shaohua.

763
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,460
It's really you.

764
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,020
Yes, it's me.

765
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,700
[Wen's Pharmacy]

766
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,380
You're still alive.

767
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,100
Yes, I am.

768
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:00,940
That's great.

769
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,380
Have you been...

770
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,220
doing okay?

771
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,980
Quite well.

772
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,100
And you?

773
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,020
Me?

774
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm fine too.

775
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,020
That's good.

776
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,820
You...

777
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,860
Who is this lady?

778
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,420
Chu Shaohua.

779
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,780
Hello, I'm Jackie, Zhou Jieru.

780
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,260
I'm Xia Chu's girlfriend.

781
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,380
I was wondering why you were late.

782
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,620
Turns out you ran into a friend.

783
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,180
And these two are?

784
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,780
This is Mr. Xia Chu.

785
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,340
Miss Zhou.

786
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,900
You are Xia Chu?

787
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,340
You know me?

788
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,820
I've seen your photo

789
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,020
at your elder brother's house.

790
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,540
You're his friend?

791
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,620
This is Wen Zhiqiu,

792
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,020
my fiancé.

793
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,620
Right?

794
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,620
Nice to meet you.

795
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,540
Nice to meet you.

796
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,300
I didn't know you knew each other.

797
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,540
Mr. Xia is a friend
from a long time ago.

798
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,820
Yes.

799
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,940
We are old friends.

800
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,420
Feels like it's been a lifetime

801
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,460
since I last saw you.

802
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,100
Well, Zhiqiu and I
need to take care of something.

803
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,460
So how about we chat another time?

804
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,780
Since you haven't seen each other
in so long,

805
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,860
how about we grab a coffee?

806
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,260
Weren't we supposed
to talk about something?

807
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,460
Let's not drag it out.

808
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,340
Goodbye.

809
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,140
We should be going, too.

810
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,100
Let's go.

811
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,020
Are you okay?

812
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,780
I'm fine.

813
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,460
Or should we drop it today?

814
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,540
I'm fine.

815
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,340
I'm okay.

816
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,580
What are

817
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,820
these future plans you spoke of?

818
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,660
Let's begin.

819
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,260
This is

820
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,980
our future Wen's Pharmacy.

821
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,700
This is the main shop in Shanghai

822
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,500
and branches in Guangzhou, Xi'an,
Peking, and Kunming.

823
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,540
That's great.

824
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Very big and beautiful.

825
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,020
What about these two?

826
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,220
Why don't these have signs?

827
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,380
Those two were made wrong.

828
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,620
Seemed like a waste to toss them out,

829
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,500
so I figured
I'd just leave them here for now.

830
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,100
Is that it?

831
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,180
That's all.

832
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,540
No more.

833
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,300
That's it?

834
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,500
You could have

835
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,340
told me all this in the office.

836
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,020
Why did you insist on me coming here?

837
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,460
Do you think these few houses can fit

838
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,780
in our office?

839
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,100
So you had to rent

840
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,620
this most expensive exhibition hall

841
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,460
in the best hotel in Shanghai

842
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,740
- Yes.
- to display so many models

843
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,780
to tell me all this?

844
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,380
Yes.

845
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,980
We made a profit.

846
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,100
I deserve a little splurge, don't I?

847
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:21,860
Sure.

848
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,500
Also,

849
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,220
why am I your fiancé again?

850
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,020
You were

851
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,460
the only one around

852
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,260
and

853
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,620
the least fitting choice.

854
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,140
That's it?

855
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,020
If I bump into him again,

856
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,580
you'll keep playing along, okay?
