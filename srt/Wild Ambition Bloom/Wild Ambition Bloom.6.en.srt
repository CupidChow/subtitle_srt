192
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,700
this time,

193
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,490
I will return with glory.

194
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,420
Erniu,

195
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,100
I only hope you stay safe and sound.

196
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,130
Don't worry.

197
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,650
I have to go.

198
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,980
Go.

199
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,180
Watch your step.

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,220
Shaohua,

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,180
look after yourself, okay?

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,650
Don't worry about me.

203
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,940
Go back.

204
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,530
You must take good care of yourself.

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,060
Stay safe and sound.

206
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,300
Hundreds of silver dollars?

207
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,220
Which assistant told you that?

208
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,980
It was the thin, dark one.

209
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,940
Shitou.

210
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,820
He has always been prudent

211
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,490
and rarely speaks carelessly.

212
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,490
I'm sure

213
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,730
Shaohua's been

214
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,850
secretly sending money

215
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,250
back to her family.

216
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,530
I told you

217
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,490
not to let our son marry someone
from a poor family.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,770
You wouldn't listen.

219
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,460
Hundreds of silver dollars!

220
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,060
If she keeps this up,

221
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,460
we'll be wiped out

222
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,300
before the year's over.

223
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,610
Shut up!

224
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,010
For heaven's sake!

225
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,060
Shaohua.

226
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,250
Song Ping.

227
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,730
You're finally back.

228
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,370
Something happened.

229
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,460
What's wrong?

230
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,580
Thanks.

231
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,610
What's wrong?

232
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,100
Father is beating Dashun.

233
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,460
He stole 200 from the shop's accounts

234
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,340
and was discovered.

235
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Dashun, you must tell the truth.

236
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,980
Did your wife take that money?

237
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,740
No.

238
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
It has nothing to do with Shaohua.

239
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,260
I embezzled it.

240
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
What did you do with that money?

241
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,300
I...

242
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,740
I spent it... on drinking and gambling.

243
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,660
I...

244
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Get the rod!

245
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,820
Father.

246
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,260
Shaohua,

247
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,780
this has nothing to do with you.
Go back to our room.

248
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
- Did you hear me?
- Don't be angry.

249
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,340
Please calm down.

250
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,940
Shaohua!

251
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,180
Shaohua, be honest,

252
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,780
what have you done?

253
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,020
Father,

254
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,300
the money was embezzled by Dashun,

255
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,580
but he did it because of me.

256
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
Shaohua, what are you doing?

257
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,420
See?

258
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
I told you!

259
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Alright.

260
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,700
Speak.

261
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,380
What did you do with that money?

262
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,900
A childhood friend of mine

263
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,300
was deceived by some bad people

264
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,340
and ended up in Linfang Pavilion.

265
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,740
I wanted to redeem her freedom,

266
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,180
but I didn't have enough money.

267
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,620
Dashun found out and wanted to help me,

268
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,180
that's why he borrowed 200

269
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,940
from our shop's accounts.

270
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,940
What kind of place is Linfang Pavilion?

271
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,820
You spent money
to bail out someone like that?

272
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Even Ershun wouldn't do such a thing.

273
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,300
Absurd!

274
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,460
Father, Mother,

275
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,300
don't blame Dashun.

276
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,220
This all started because of me.

277
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,580
I'll face the consequences.

278
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,780
Father, I was the one
who took the money.

279
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,980
Shaohua had nothing to do with it.

280
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,260
Let me take the punishment.

281
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,660
Can you get the money back?

282
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Mother, don't worry.

283
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll pay it back

284
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,740
before the year's over.

285
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,660
What you eat, what you use,

286
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,860
and the house you live in

287
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,300
are all provided by us.

288
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,500
How will you pay it back?

289
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,180
Although I eat and live at home,

290
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,780
I've been earning money for the family.

291
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,460
With the measly amount you earn?

292
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,100
Father,

293
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,180
Shaohua and I
will not take dividends this year.

294
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,340
Dividends?

295
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,700
Do you think the dividends

296
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,780
can cover a hole this big?

297
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,020
Fine, then we won't take any
next year either.

298
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,860
We'll take them when the hole is filled.

299
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,180
So you're saying

300
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,380
if it takes decades to fix this mess,

301
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,020
then we won't see the money back

302
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,060
for decades, huh?

303
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,220
It won't take long.

304
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,860
I said I'd pay it back
before the end of the year.

305
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
What about the interest

306
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,420
and the fine?

307
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,820
Speak up.

308
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,420
Before the end of the year,

309
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,140
is it enough if I pay back 2,000?

310
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
Shaohua, what are you saying?

311
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,940
You said it yourself.

312
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,500
Shaohua, what if you can't do it?

313
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,380
If I fail to repay it...

314
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,300
I'll... keep working,

315
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,740
no pay,

316
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,780
no dividends.

317
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,540
Okay.

318
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,140
You said that yourself.

319
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,140
Get up.

320
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,500
Darling!

321
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,900
Darling, this is it?

322
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,420
Get up.

323
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,420
Get up.

324
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,300
Why didn't you tell me

325
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,860
you got the money
from our shop's account?

326
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,460
If I had told you,

327
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,340
it would've put you in a tough spot.

328
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,020
That's why I couldn't say anything.

329
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,620
Weren't you afraid

330
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,740
Father would break your leg?

331
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,340
If you couldn't save Erniu,

332
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,980
you would be sad, right?

333
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,900
Compared to a broken leg,

334
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,380
I'm more afraid of making you sad.

335
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:35,980
Dashun.

336
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,740
Dashun.

337
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,380
You've made a bold promise

338
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,740
to earn 2,000 by the year's end.

339
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
Do you have any ideas how to earn it?

340
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,060
Hello.

341
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,020
This is Chen's Apothecary's
discount voucher.

342
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,860
Hello, Chen's Apothecary's
discount voucher.

343
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,540
Now I'll wipe off this Yurong Balm.

344
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,060
[Juxiu House]
Isn't it whiter and more tender

345
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,220
than the side without Yurong Balm?

346
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,740
The Summer Solstice

347
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,620
marks the peak of yang energy.

348
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,820
It's a crucial time for nourishing
and protecting it to preserve health.

349
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,740
So, we use

350
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,660
this yang-nourishing sachet made with
Wuweizi, Longyan, and American Ginseng.

During the Great Heat season,

361
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,100
as the saying goes,
"Treat winter illnesses in summer."

362
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,660
It's the ideal time

363
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,900
to nourish and regulate yang deficiency.

364
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
If you need anything,

378
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,780
feel free to visit our apothecary,

379
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,540
or we can deliver it straight
to your door.

380
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,580
Check out Chen's Apothecary's
discount voucher.

381
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,660
Remember to avoid spicy food.

382
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,660
Alright.

383
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,260
Take care.

384
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,540
You're back.

385
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,940
Come on, you must be tired.

386
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,540
How did things go for you today?

387
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,340
Today,

388
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,100
I visited 15 brothels.

389
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,940
Got eight new customers.

390
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,500
Here.

391
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,220
Sold 15 boxes of Yurong Powder

392
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,300
and 8 boxes of Yurong Cream.

393
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,620
Not bad.

394
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,580
Help me check

395
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,940
how much money I've earned up to today.

396
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,340
Including today's earnings,

397
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,860
a total of 152 silver dollars.

398
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,940
Really?

399
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,620
What's wrong?

400
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,140
You don't trust my accounting?

401
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,060
See for yourself.

402
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,620
No.

403
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,420
I'm screwed.

404
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,140
I'm telling you,

405
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,260
there's no way

406
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,300
I can make 2,000 by the year's end.

407
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,260
But that's still months away.

408
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,220
But I've used up all the tricks I know.

409
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,500
It's okay, no rush.

410
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,060
Have some more.

411
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,740
Why didn't you

412
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,620
stop me back then?

413
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,180
I was being impulsive

414
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,340
and made a big promise to Father.

415
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,540
Worst case, you'll just

416
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,780
spend the rest of your life

417
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
working as our unpaid clerk, right?

418
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
No, that won't do.

419
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,740
Then I'll be at a loss.

420
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
We're all family.

421
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,500
What loss?

422
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,300
Is the shopkeeper in?

423
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,900
Yes.

424
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
Hello, sir.

425
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,500
How can I help you?

426
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,740
I am Gao Qianyi
from Peking's Shouyuan Apothecary.

427
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,580
Mr. Gao.

428
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,780
Sir.

429
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,660
Please, anything would help.

430
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,620
What are you doing?

431
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,940
What's wrong with you?

432
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,660
Let go.

433
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,900
Sir.

434
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,300
Take it.

435
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,380
Take it.

436
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,940
Go get yourself something nice to eat.

437
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Thank you, sir.

438
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,860
I've heard much about you.

439
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,900
You're too kind.

440
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,700
I've also heard much

441
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,940
about your Yurong Powder.

442
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,860
Today,

443
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,980
I came to learn from you.

444
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,340
Mr. Gao, you flatter me.

445
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,820
This way, please.

446
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,660
- Please.
- Please.

447
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,380
All of these were made

448
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
by my eldest daughter-in-law.

449
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,380
It's her work?

450
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,340
These are all women's products,

451
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,060
so honestly,

452
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,580
I don't really know much

453
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,780
about the questions you just asked.

454
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,380
Shaohua.

455
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,740
Shaohua.

456
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,940
Father asked you to come over.

457
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,540
Father.

458
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,420
Father.

459
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,460
Perfect.

460
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,620
Then,

461
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,700
let Shaohua

462
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,100
answer you in detail.

463
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,380
Come on.

464
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,820
Greetings, Mr. Gao.

465
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,300
It's an honor, ma'am.

466
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,620
What would you like to know?

467
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,100
As far as I know,

468
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,980
Yurong Powder

469
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,260
sells extremely well on the market.

470
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,380
During my visit today, I noticed

471
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,100
that in addition to Yurong Powder,

472
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,860
you've also launched
Yurong Cream, Yurong Serum,

473
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,100
Yurong Balm, and Yurong Mingmou Balm.

474
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,900
What are their respective uses?

475
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,060
Yurong Serum

476
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,740
is used during face washing.

477
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,460
After cleansing,

478
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,620
apply Yurong Cream as a base,

479
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,660
then finish with Yurong Powder.

480
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,380
[Yurong Cream]
Better than just applying the powder.

481
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,380
With consistent use,

482
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,500
your skin can stay smooth, fair,
and radiant for a long time.

483
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,140
So cumbersome?

484
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,620
Everyone loves beauty.

485
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,740
Why fear cumbersomeness?

486
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,380
Based on my calculations,

487
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,180
if just one-tenth of Peking's wealthy

488
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,260
starts using Yurong Powder,

489
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,460
and each box lasts a month,

490
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,540
your profits

491
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,180
will be impressive.

492
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,300
But now,

493
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,260
on top of the Yurong Powder,

494
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
you've added Yurong Cream
and Yurong Serum.

495
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,620
The profits are several times
what they used to be.

496
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,780
That's true.

497
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,180
If I'm not mistaken,

498
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,300
this Yurong Mingmou Balm,

499
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,180
as the name suggests,

500
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,540
is used around the eyes.

501
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,260
Precisely.

502
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,780
And what about this Mengtian Toner?

503
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,460
This is for application before bed,

504
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,780
allowing women to nourish
their skin even in their sleep,

505
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,300
and wake up radiant.

506
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,820
Is that so?

507
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,260
Mr. Gao,

508
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,180
how about you take a bottle back

509
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,780
and let your wife try it?

510
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,020
Thank you very much.

511
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,780
These beauty remedies
have existed since ancient times.

512
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,740
They are nothing new.

513
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,740
But the way you've managed
to promote them so successfully

514
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
is truly impressive.

515
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,980
Mr. Gao, you flatter me.

516
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,620
I only meant

517
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,740
to attract more customers

518
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,340
to our apothecary.

519
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,100
In my opinion,

520
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,860
your ambition

521
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,540
should be more than just this, right?

522
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,300
Mr. Gao, why do you say that?

523
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,740
If it were just about getting
more customers,

524
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,460
why go as far as

525
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
buying the woman's portrait rights?

526
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,700
And why make "Chen's" so prominent

527
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,020
on the packaging?

528
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,380
Mr. Chen, if you're looking to promote

529
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,260
the Yurong Powder line more broadly,

530
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,780
we'd be happy to offer our support.

531
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,460
Mr. Gao,

532
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,300
what do you mean?

533
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,780
Let's collaborate

534
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,180
on developing and selling Yurong Powder.

535
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,460
What do you say?

536
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,340
Mr. Gao,

537
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,260
Shouyuan Apothecary
is one of the leading national names

538
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,900
in the native medicine industry today.

539
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,180
It would be an honor

540
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,700
to work with you.

541
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,420
Truly.

542
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,540
Mr. Chen, you flatter me.

543
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,300
Shouyuan Apothecary

544
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,340
only has some connections
north and south of the Yangtze River.

545
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,420
If we join forces on Yurong Powder,

546
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,740
I can't guarantee outcomes,

547
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,060
but all of our pharmacies

548
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,700
and hundreds of partners

549
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,940
will go all in.

550
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,420
Mr. Gao,

551
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,100
that would be wonderful.

552
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,020
Since you agree,

553
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,260
let me arrange a dinner
at the Grand Hotel.

554
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,940
Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen Junior,
I'd be honored if you could join me.

555
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,420
We can go over the details
of our collaboration during dinner.

556
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,980
Grand Hotel?

557
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,580
Exactly.

558
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,460
Mr. Chen, which day are you free?

559
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,700
Anytime.

560
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,740
Whatever suits you.

561
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,700
I'm free anytime.

562
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,900
Please, Mr. Chen, set the date.

563
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,740
Why not today?

564
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,260
Let's make it tonight.

565
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,020
That would be wonderful.

566
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,820
Hope you'll join us too, ma'am.

567
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,500
Me?

568
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,220
Certainly.

569
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,220
She's coming too.

570
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,260
Then tonight at six,

571
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,860
I will await you all at the Grand Hotel.

572
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,820
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

573
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,260
Farewell.

574
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,180
Take care.

575
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,620
Mr. Chen, I can see myself out.

576
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,380
Don't trouble yourself.

577
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,060
When we were back in Qizhou,

578
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,100
you said you'd take me
to the Grand Hotel

579
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,020
so I could see what it's all about.

580
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
I didn't expect it
to actually come true.

581
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
They say

582
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,140
one meal there

583
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,420
costs more than
a family's yearly budget.

584
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,540
I also heard

585
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,580
only foreigners stay there.

586
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,900
What's wrong?

587
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,500
What's on your mind?

588
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,220
I was just thinking

589
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,300
Shouyuan Apothecary
is such a giant in the business.

590
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,660
Compared to them,

591
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,700
we're barely a speck.

592
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,180
Maybe we should just forget it.

593
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,460
If Shouyuan Apothecary managed

594
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,500
to grow their business that big,

595
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,660
it means they're not fools, right?

596
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,780
They know we're not a big operation,

597
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,580
yet they still came to us
for a partnership.

598
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,820
They must see something special in us.

599
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
If they value us this much,

600
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,660
then we've no reason to doubt ourselves.

601
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
That's true,

602
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
but deep down,

603
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,660
I still feel uneasy.

604
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,700
Do you think

605
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,420
it's because the owner
of Shouyuan Apothecary is Xia Yuan

606
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,540
that you're feeling uneasy?

607
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,020
Dashun,

608
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,740
since I chose to marry you then,

609
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,220
it means I've made up my mind.

610
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,580
You're the one I chose for this life.

611
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,660
Shaohua.

612
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,420
Don't worry,

613
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,700
only you and the Chen family.

614
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,260
All I care about now

615
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,620
is making our family business

616
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,900
thrive.

617
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,340
I'm sorry.

618
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,500
I let my emotions get the better of me.

619
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,300
Go get changed.

620
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,900
Okay.

621
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,300
Get me the black iron-thread jacket.

622
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,420
What took you so long?

623
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,980
That's the one.

624
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,620
Grand Hotel. Awsome.

625
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,100
I just saw it

626
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,980
from afar.

627
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,780
I didn't even dare to walk closer.

628
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,260
Don't worry.

629
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,540
Once this deal
with Shouyuan Apothecary goes through,

630
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,660
and we start making money,

631
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,420
I'll take you there
so you can check it out for yourself.

632
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,700
No.

633
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,900
Is the collar okay?

634
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,340
I'm not going.

635
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,100
We don't need to splurge on that.

636
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,580
I heard there are many foreigners.

637
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,300
I'd save that money instead.

638
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,340
You're always pinching pennies.

639
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,060
Is that all you know?

640
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,780
Father, the carriage is here.

641
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,900
Father.

642
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,460
Mother.

643
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,700
Very good.

644
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,380
Wearing something that flashy,

645
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,780
don't you think people might talk?

646
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,780
Mother...

647
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,100
That's nonsense.

648
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,860
When she looks good,

649
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,660
it makes the whole family
look good. Got it?

650
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,020
Let's go.

651
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,660
Wait.

652
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,460
Put these on.

653
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,860
Take them.

654
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,580
Don't let anyone think less of us.

655
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
Thank you, Mother.

656
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,780
Don't lose them.

657
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,500
You have to give them back.

658
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,700
Are you going to let her
wear them or not?

659
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,700
Yes.

660
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,620
So annoying.

661
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,620
Let's go.

662
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,500
Mother, we're leaving.

663
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,180
Bye, Mother.

664
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,660
Let's go.

665
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,820
Mr. Chen,

666
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,860
Mr. and Mrs. Chen Junior.

667
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,540
Mr. Gao.

668
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,500
Apologies for not coming out
to meet you.

669
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,940
This way, please.

670
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
Please.

671
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,700
After you.

672
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,660
Come, Mr. Chen Junior.

673
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,580
Mr. Chen.

674
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,340
This way.

675
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:05,740
Okay.

676
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,540
I meant to come down and welcome you.

677
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm so sorry I didn't make it.

678
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,180
Come on.

679
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,660
This way, please.

680
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,380
Please.

681
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,580
I'm truly sorry.

682
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,420
Our head manager Mr. Xu

683
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,460
was supposed to come today.

684
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,100
But unfortunately,

685
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,860
Mr. Yan, the Military Governor
of Shanxi,

686
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,380
appointed the largest
local pharmaceutical trader

687
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,860
to lead a procurement delegation

688
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,940
to Peking to purchase
medicinal materials.

689
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,340
So Mr. Xu

690
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,980
rushed over to entertain them.

691
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,900
Since it's just me tonight,

692
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,140
I'll do my best to host your family.

693
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,860
Mr. Gao, thank you.

694
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,340
You're too kind.

695
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,860
Please dig in.

696
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,740
The Taigu traders in Shanxi
are no small players.

697
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,380
Why would they come all the way
to Peking

698
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,220
instead of sourcing locally?

699
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,460
Ma'am,

700
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,260
you may not know.

701
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,380
Taigu's traders are led
by the Guang Trade Guild,

702
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,420
known for premium tonics.

703
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,740
But this time,

704
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,220
they came to Peking

705
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,820
for battlefield medical supplies.

706
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,780
Is there going to be a war?

707
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,140
A military government
has taken hold in Guangdong.

708
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,620
The North-South conflict

709
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,060
is bound

710
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,220
to happen.

711
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,300
It's the common folk who'll suffer.

712
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,780
Mr. Chen Junior, your compassion

713
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,540
is truly something to be admired.

714
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,900
Here, I'll drink a toast to you.

715
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,100
Mr. Gao, you flatter me.

716
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,460
Come on.

717
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,340
I'd like to make a toast, too.

718
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,620
May peace prevail
throughout the land soon,

719
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,700
and may the common people
live in stable times.

720
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,780
Truly a match made in heaven.

721
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,140
Come on.

722
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,500
Come.

723
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,740
The war may be raging,

724
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,180
but business still has to go on.

725
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,460
This military supply order

726
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,220
must be at least 30,000 silver dollars,
right?

727
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,540
Approximately.

728
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,460
With Shouyuan Apothecary making a move,

729
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,060
it's definitely a sure thing.

730
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,060
Mr. Chen,

731
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,340
you flatter us.

732
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,620
To be honest,

733
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,100
the top ten apothecaries in China

734
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,020
are all eyeing this juicy piece of meat.

735
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,660
We

736
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,700
might not necessarily
be able to secure it.

737
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,700
Mr. Gao,

738
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,620
if even you cannot secure this order,

739
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,980
I'm afraid

740
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,220
others

741
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,140
will be even less likely to.

742
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,820
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

743
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,940
Well,

744
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,220
congratulations in advance.

745
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,620
Mr. Gao.

746
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,140
I'll take your words

747
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,380
as a blessing.

748
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,940
Thanks.

749
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,060
Have a seat.

750
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,580
Enough business for now.

751
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,380
Please dig in.

752
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,940
Okay.

753
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,740
Please.

754
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,340
Come on, please.

755
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,700
Mr. Chen,

756
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,620
I'll prepare the cooperation agreement

757
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,140
as discussed

758
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
and let you review it.

759
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,660
Please.

760
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,260
Are you okay?

761
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,340
I'm fine.

762
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:50,940
Are you alright?

763
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,780
Mr. Xu,

764
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,460
you really didn't have to
go to such expense.

765
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,420
Don't mention it.

766
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,580
We're honored to have you.

767
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,620
Okay.

768
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,780
Thanks in advance.

769
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,540
Okay.

770
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,300
Easy.

771
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,020
Alright, see you around.

772
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,580
Take him to the Peking Hotel.

773
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,100
Okay.

774
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,740
Father, the carriage is here.

775
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,500
Mr. Gao,

776
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,740
I'll take my leave.

777
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,300
Mr. Chen, take care.

778
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,980
Farewell. Okay.

779
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,780
Ma'am, please.

780
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,420
Okay.

781
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,540
A military medical supply order
of 30,000 silver dollars.

782
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,900
This could easily bring in

783
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,060
over 10,000 in profit.

784
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,660
Shouyuan Apothecary
holds serious influence.

785
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,180
They have raw medicinal material outlets
in every key production region.

786
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,500
I'm afraid it's more than that.

787
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,420
What if we do it instead?

788
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,420
What are you thinking?

789
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,260
Doing business.

790
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,460
We don't have

791
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,220
Shouyuan's pricing edge,

792
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,540
but we should still be able

793
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,540
to pull in 5,000 or more.

794
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,060
How could such an order

795
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,220
fall into our hands?

796
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,060
Why not?

797
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,740
Didn't you hear Mr. Gao say?

798
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,700
The top ten apothecaries in China
are all eyeing it.

799
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,020
Let's not dwell on it.

800
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,180
We've got a small business to run,

801
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,860
and we'll do it right.

802
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,020
We've got to keep
the small business going,

803
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,500
but we should also think
about the bigger opportunities.

804
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,220
But some things are pointless
to think about.

805
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,140
Dashun,

806
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,780
I actually think we can try.

807
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,740
You sure you're okay?

808
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,540
What if it works?

809
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,020
Impossible.

810
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,940
Look,

811
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,660
Xuan isn't smiling.

812
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,900
Even she thinks you're fantasizing.

813
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:57,480
[Peking Hotel]

814
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,140
Thank you.

815
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,280
[Peking Hotel]

816
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,460
Excuse me.

817
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,700
I am Chu Shaohua from Chen's Apothecary.

818
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,860
I've come to visit

819
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,740
the Procurement Commissioner
of Mr. Yan of Shanxi.

820
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,660
Please announce my arrival.

821
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,900
Mr. Xu has given orders

822
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,220
that no one is to be announced.

823
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,620
Sir, please help me.

824
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,140
I can't.

825
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Look at this crowd.

826
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,620
Everyone's here for him.

827
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,100
Find a spot and wait.

828
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,740
Thank you.

829
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,500
Everyone in Peking knows

830
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,940
your Hanchun Apothecary.

831
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,180
You're giving me too much credit.

832
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,740
Compared to your Qingyu Apothecary,

833
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,900
we still have a long way to go.

834
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,580
You flatter me.

835
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,980
Who else has come too?

836
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,900
Mr. Tian is also here.

837
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Which Mr. Tian?

838
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,060
Mr. Tian from Tian's Apothecary
in Shanghai.

839
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,940
Even Tian's Apothecary is here?

840
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,140
I'm afraid we have no hope.

841
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,820
The Tians

842
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,260
have built an empire,

843
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,100
and they're still chasing scraps
from folks like us.

844
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,500
Mr. Xu is here.

845
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,180
Mr. Xu!

846
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,060
Where is he?

847
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,860
I am from Qingyu Apothecary.

848
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,460
- Mr. Xu!
- Mr. Xu!

849
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,580
- I'm from Qingyu Apothecary!
- Mr. Xu!

850
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,300
- Mr. Xu!
- Mr. Xu!

851
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,140
- Mr. Xu!
- Mr. Xu!

852
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,620
Mr. Xu!

853
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,180
I'm from Qingyu Apothecary!

854
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,940
Mr. Xu, over here!

855
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,060
Please hear me out, Mr. Xu.

856
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,980
Who do you think you are?

857
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,580
You think you're somebody?

858
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
Listen up.

859
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm the one in charge here!

860
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,980
I call the shots
in the Logistics Department!

861
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,220
You think I'm bluffing?

862
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,900
One word from me

863
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,020
when I get back,

864
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,100
and Mr. Yan will drop you!

865
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,940
Do it, I dare you!

866
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,380
Why wouldn't I dare?

867
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,300
Mr. Lan, let's just drop it.

868
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,780
Don't take me for a pushover!

869
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,220
I've got people close to Mr. Yan too!

870
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,260
What's your deal?
You trying to pick a fight?

871
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,540
You think I'm scared of you?

872
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,940
Mr. Xu.

873
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,420
Get away!

874
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,420
Please don't stoop to his level.

875
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,340
Fighting with me?

876
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,100
Don't you even know who my mother is?

877
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,940
Who are you?

878
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,060
I...

879
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,540
When did Peking Hotel

880
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,380
get such a beautiful maid?

881
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,620
How come I haven't seen you before?

882
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,860
You're way too pretty

883
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,380
to be working as a maid.

884
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,220
Don't touch me.

885
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,300
How about

886
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,780
I take you to Shanxi?

887
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,300
Good food, soft beds,

888
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,500
and a life of ease. Deal?

889
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,460
- You ungrateful wretch!
- Mr. Xu.

890
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,140
You...

891
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,300
Don't stoop to the level of a servant.

892
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,180
Mr. Xu.

893
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,300
Get out!

894
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,180
Are you okay?

895
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm fine.

896
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,860
He hit me too.

897
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,380
Here, take this.

898
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,260
You're bleeding.

899
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,460
Thank you.

900
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,420
Take it slow. You don't want to choke.

901
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,700
I heard

902
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,940
the sleazy one
is Mr. Yan's wife's uncle.

903
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,540
And the violent one

904
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,940
is his concubine's cousin.

905
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,980
Those two don't seem to get along.

906
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,820
Oh, it's way more than that.

907
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,300
They start arguing the moment they meet.

908
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,980
Sometimes they nearly come to blows.

909
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,500
Why is that?

910
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,940
It seems to be all
about who's calling the shots

911
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,860
on procurement.

912
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,340
And

913
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,700
who is the one wearing

914
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,940
the officer's uniform?

915
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,180
That's Mr. Shang, an adjutant.

916
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,540
He's a good person, though.

917
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,500
But in front of those two,

918
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,820
he can't say a thing.

919
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,140
Here,

920
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,380
take this.

921
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,300
Pick up something tasty for your mother.

922
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,300
Hua.

923
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,180
You

924
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,740
cleaned me up,

925
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,140
took care of my wounds,

926
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,060
and treated me
to all kinds of good things.

927
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,140
How could I possibly take your money?

928
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980
Just take it.

929
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,020
I'll probably be bothering you a lot.

930
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,860
Thank you.

931
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,900
Go ahead.

932
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
There's still some shaomai left.

933
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,700
Tell me if you need more.

934
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,940
Dashun.

935
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,580
Where have you been?

936
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,740
Mr. Gao is here?

937
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,460
He's been here for quite a while.

938
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,100
He's discussing
the cooperation agreement with Father.

939
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,700
I completely understand your concerns.

940
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,060
I'll check in with Mr. Xia,

941
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,100
and we'll give it some more thought.

942
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,500
Of course,

943
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,900
if you change your mind,

944
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,620
I'll await your presence at any time.

945
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,380
Mr. Gao.

946
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,900
I appreciate it.

947
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,820
Mr. Gao.

948
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,660
Ma'am, you're back.

949
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,060
Yes. I just got back,
and you're already leaving.

950
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,820
Well, our business is busy.

951
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,940
I have to rush back.

952
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,100
Mr. Gao,

953
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,900
the supply order
for Shouyuan Apothecary and Shanxi

954
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,460
should've already been signed, right?

955
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,780
Not yet.

956
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,460
Didn't the commissioner from Shanxi

957
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,900
see Shouyuan Apothecary as a good fit?

958
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,100
No, it's not that.

959
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,540
Then why?

960
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,660
Our head manager

961
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,740
had a good discussion
with the commissioner.

962
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,580
But another apothecary

963
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,220
went through someone else's connections

964
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,900
and caused some complications.

965
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,340
Who would be bold enough

966
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,740
to snatch business
from Shouyuan Apothecary?

967
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,940
The Tian family in Shanghai.

968
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:03,980
Mr. Chen,

969
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,020
Mr. and Mrs. Chen Junior,

970
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,500
I'll take my leave.

971
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,380
Take care.

972
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,980
I'll find my own way out.

973
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:18,860
Father,

974
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,620
how was it? Did you reach an agreement?

975
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,740
I'm afraid the collaboration
isn't going to go through.

976
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,220
Why?

977
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,580
They want us to share
the secret formula of Yurong Powder.

978
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,180
For every box sold,

979
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,420
Shouyuan Apothecary
is asking for 60 percent of the profits.

980
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,460
Yurong Powder is ours.

981
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,260
They're just helping us sell it.

982
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,620
So we should be taking
the larger share, right?

983
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,420
It's true.

984
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,940
But they want access
to the secret formula

985
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,940
and they want
a forty-sixty profit split.

986
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,100
How could I possibly agree to that?

987
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,100
They're throwing their weight around.

988
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,420
Father,

989
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,660
I actually think

990
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,060
we can accept both of these conditions.

991
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,300
Tell me why.

992
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,780
Right now, we're selling
2,000 boxes a month.

993
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,220
A net profit of 50 cents per box

994
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
gives us
a maximum monthly profit of 1,000.

995
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,420
But Shouyuan Apothecary

996
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,380
has branches everywhere

997
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,420
and partners too.

998
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,300
If we join them,

999
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,020
then we'd sell
at least 6,000 boxes a month.

1000
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,020
Even after giving away
60 percent of the profit,

1001
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,700
we'd still be making 1,200 a month.

1002
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,660
Compared to before,

1003
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,500
our monthly profit would go up by 200.

1004
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,500
Giving up the secret formula

1005
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,900
for

1006
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,620
just 200 more a month,

1007
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,460
doesn't that seem like a terrible deal?

1008
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,780
The formula for Yurong Powder

1009
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,540
isn't worth much.

1010
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,900
It's doing well now

1011
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,460
only because we got ahead of the game.
