188
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,340
Has his father recovered
from the stroke?

189
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,780
Mr. Xia, just say it.

190
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,180
Miss Chu, you're refreshingly direct.

191
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,220
Okay, let me cut to the chase.

192
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,620
I've got 170,000 jin
of Qizhou Ziwan in hand.

193
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,340
Mr. Xia, please name your price.

194
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,900
Alright.

195
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,940
I'll be straight with you too.

196
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,460
Whatever price
the Tian family offers you,

197
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,140
I'll add ten percent.

198
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,300
Just one condition,

199
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,660
I want the whole lot.

200
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,020
Ziwan's going rate today
is five jiao per jin.

201
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,740
Then I'll give you five jiao and five fen.

202
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,020
Deal.

203
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,180
But I've got a condition.

204
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,300
Go ahead.

205
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,140
I only want it at four jiao
and five fen per jin.

206
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,180
But I want full payment
by the end of today.

207
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,740
Is that so?

208
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,420
I guarantee

209
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,420
it's all this good.

210
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,540
Deal.

211
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,220
As for the follow-up,

212
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,380
Mr. Yi will get in touch with you.

213
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,220
No problem.

214
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,060
But I do have one question.

215
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,300
Weren't you planning
to ship this batch to Shanghai?

216
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,380
So why rent such a small stall here?

217
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,220
Mr. Xia,

218
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,620
that talk about shipping to Shanghai

219
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,980
was just a bluff.

220
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,100
I have no ties to the Tian family.

221
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,260
Really?

222
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,140
That's one of the reasons I'm willing

223
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,140
to sell it all to you

224
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,500
at four jiao and five fen per jin.

225
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,700
I don't want you thinking

226
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm with the Tian family.

227
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,140
And the second reason?

228
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
In three days,

229
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,060
I'll need to pay off the farmers.

230
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,100
Otherwise,

231
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,940
all this Ziwan I'm holding

232
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,300
will be sent back

233
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,180
and I won't even get my deposit back.

234
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
So you're saying,

235
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,020
if I hadn't come to you today,

236
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,700
you'd be knocking on my door
within two days anyway.

237
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,980
Yes.

238
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,620
But I knew

239
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,980
you'd come to me first.

240
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,860
Why?

241
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,300
Because you're curious about me.

242
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,540
Indeed.

243
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,180
Though now, I'm more curious

244
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,820
about how much
you still owe the farmers.

245
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,780
Ninety percent.

246
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,540
Seriously?

247
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,220
That's right.

248
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,220
If you still owe them ninety percent,

249
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,220
your buying price
had to be at least three jiao,

250
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,380
maybe three jiao five fen tops.

251
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,340
So that means

252
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,020
you dropped 6,000 silver dollars

253
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,180
and pocketed 8,000.

254
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,380
I only started with 35.

255
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,820
After all the expenses,

256
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,020
I'm left with just 6,000 in profit.

257
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,340
Walk me through it.

258
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,380
With 35 as a deposit,

259
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,180
I signed a Ziwan purchase contract

260
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,700
worth 350.

261
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,500
Then I took that contract

262
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,780
to the banks and used it as collateral.

263
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,020
That alone

264
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,940
got me at least 150 in silver.

265
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,540
Then I kept running the same play.

266
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,020
Miss Chu,

267
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,700
I have a feeling

268
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,420
we'll be

269
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,420
doing a lot of business together.

270
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,860
Thanks for your trust, Mr. Xia.

271
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,980
But you've laid
all your cards on the table.

272
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,900
Miss Chu,

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,100
aren't you worried I would backtrack
and drive the price down?

274
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,340
Mr. Xia,

275
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,820
going back on your word

276
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,540
is not your style.

277
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,860
Doing business with you
has been a real pleasure.

278
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,300
The honor

279
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,660
is mine.

280
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,740
I'll take my leave.

281
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,980
OK. Please.

282
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,660
Dajin,

283
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,860
I've sorted the deal with Miss Chu.

284
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,220
You'll handle things with her.

285
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,300
Alright. Got it.

286
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,260
Mrs. Chen Junior?

287
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Mr. Gao, long time no see.

288
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,780
You two know each other?

289
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,140
Mr. Xia, Miss Chu

290
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,380
has got another title.

291
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,980
She's also Mrs. Chen Junior.

292
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,780
So you're the one

293
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,180
who snatched the military order from Xu.

294
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,460
Just happened
to catch a lucky break, that's all.

295
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,100
I used to think
it was all luck and timing.

296
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,140
But after meeting you today,

297
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,860
I changed my mind.

298
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,500
Luo,

299
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,700
get him in the carriage.

300
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:25,900
Take a look.

301
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,740
These are Yi Dajin's records
from the past two years.

302
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,260
Here you go, Mr. Xu.

303
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,540
Chichun Apothecary hasn't done
as well as expected.

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,340
I took it over,

305
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,300
hoping to ride on its name

306
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,620
and get into
the finished medicine business.

307
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,780
Never thought it'd...

308
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,940
Perhaps running an apothecary
isn't Yi Dajin's thing.

309
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,860
The raw medicinal materials business

310
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,180
hasn't shown much promise either.

311
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,180
Exactly.

312
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,540
This year,

313
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,100
someone snatched up Qizhou Ziwan

314
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,340
for 35 silver dollars.

315
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,660
Yes.

316
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,180
Good thing Mr. Xia turned things around.

317
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,140
Well...

318
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,220
You noticed it too?

319
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,500
What is it?

320
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,380
Some of these accounts

321
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,660
seem fine,

322
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,860
but once you line them up,

323
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,100
the figures don't quite add up, Mr. Xia.

324
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,020
I found out last year.

325
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,300
Last year?

326
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,900
Then you should've fired him back then.

327
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,940
It's not that simple.

328
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,860
If he was fired last year,

329
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,500
who would've handled the Qizhou market?

330
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,380
Who would've kept
Chichun Apothecary running?

331
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,420
If we didn't find
the right person to take over,

332
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,340
we'd have lost even more.

333
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,900
We can't keep
a double-crosser like him around.

334
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,780
I know.

335
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,500
You've found

336
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,700
someone to take over?

337
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,820
What do you

338
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,340
think of Chu Shaohua?

339
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,900
Mom, how much longer
do I have to drink this stuff?

340
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,700
Keep Song's words in mind.

341
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,660
He said

342
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,900
you've got too much dampness.

343
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,540
It's turned into phlegm,

344
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,020
clogging up your meridians,

345
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,580
messing with your qi and blood.

346
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
That's why you haven't been able
to get pregnant.

347
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,700
You'll need
a good six months of treatment

348
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,300
to get your meridians unblocked

349
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,940
and your qi and blood back in balance.

350
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Then I can get pregnant?

351
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,500
I can't count
on your sister-in-law anymore.

352
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,900
We're all looking to you
to carry this forward.

353
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,100
I've poured serious money into this.

354
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,420
If you still can't get pregnant,

355
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,660
don't come crying to me later

356
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,780
saying I didn't warn you.

357
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,540
I'll have Ershun look into other options.

358
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,580
Alright, Mother, I'll drink it now.

359
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,500
Mother.

360
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm back.

361
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,740
Shaohua.

362
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,420
Look who finally came back.

363
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,020
What

364
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,740
is this?

365
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,620
Open it up.

366
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,380
That's a lot of money.

367
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,020
Mother, from now on,

368
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
you won't have to stress
over Chen Ershun not sending money back.

369
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,340
I'll be the one supporting us.

370
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,580
You've been running around day and night

Yes.

Yes.

375
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,100
Why didn't you say something sooner?

376
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,500
Would you have listened?

377

491
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,580
you sell tooth powder too?

492
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,620
Same idea as Chen's Apothecary
selling Yurong Powder.

493
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,140
So why don't you
just sell Yurong Powder instead?

494
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,540
Qizhou isn't like Peking.

495
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,100
You can't fetch a good price
for Yurong Powder here.

496
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,540
Please, have a seat over here.

497
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,540
Then we'll talk.

498
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,740
Please.

499
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,340
This is a great location.

500
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,820
The rent must be pretty steep.

501
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,660
Aside from stocking inventory,

502
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,860
rent is probably the biggest expense.

503
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,740
So why choose this spot?

504
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,500
In business, foot traffic matters most.

505
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,420
I spent seven days
watching the main streets

506
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,660
in Qizhou.

507
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,900
Turns out, this street had
the most people passing through.

508
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,300
And this particular stretch

509
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,380
was the busiest of all.

510
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,580
So I made a snap decision
and took the shop.

511
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,860
Is the account able

512
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,660
to stay in the black?

513
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,500
The rent here

514
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
is 30 percent higher than elsewhere,

515
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,420
but the foot traffic is twice as much.

516
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,820
Each month, our net profit

517
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
is at least 100 silver dollars more.

518
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,820
So that means

519
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,300
you'd break even in eighteen months.

520
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,300
I'm aiming to do it in twelve.

521
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,260
That's impressive.

522
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,260
You're too kind.

523
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,740
What a pity.

524
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,460
Earning an extra hundred a month,

525
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,460
and making back the cost
of a whole apothecary in a year.

526
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,220
Miss Chu,

527
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,220
is that really enough?

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,140
Alright, I'll be direct.

533
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,140
This shop's just too small for you

534

whatever you put in at the start.

547
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,540
This is my first time
running an apothecary.

548
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,660
I just want to see

549
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,220
if I can make Huashun Apothecary
a success.

550
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,660
No doubt about it.

551
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,420
With your skills, Miss Chu,

552
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,140

one of Qizhou's top earners.

554
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
But then what?

Earning a fortune each year,

556
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,940
with your family living in comfort,

557
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,780
and spending your life
as the owner of a small apothecary?

558
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,780
Miss Chu,

559
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,020
is that truly enough for you?

560
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,420
But...

561
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,140
The Qizhou Medicine Market
brings in millions each year.

562
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,300
Chichun Apothecary

563
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,580
is at least

564
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,380
three times the size of Huashun.

565
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,060
And I plan

566
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,940
to open branches in Peking, Tianjin,
and Dalian.

567
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,380
I think

568
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,980
that matches your ambition.

569
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,700
Don't hesitate.

570
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,300
Join us.

571
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,260
Besides,

572
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,260
Chichun Apothecary
was your family's to begin with.

573
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,580
You're the perfect person to run it.

574
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,420
What position would I hold?

575
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,900
The same as Yi Dajin

576
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,980
and Gao Qianyi.

577
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,860
Same pay, same share,

578
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,420
nothing less.

579
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,980
Thanks again, Mr. Xia.

580
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
I'd rather

581
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,300
stay at Huashun Apothecary.

582
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,540
It's not about anything else.

583
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,500
I need to find out

584
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,780
how far I can push myself

585
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,260
and where I'll land,

586
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,940
relying on nothing but my own strength.

587
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,100
Here's one piece of advice.

588
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,780
In business,

589
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,780
it's all about

590
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,340
using the right support
and catching the right wave.

591
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,220
To me, doing business

592
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
starts with knowing who you are.

593
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,780
That's right.

594
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,300
OK, Miss Chu.

595
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,940
I respect that kind of guts.

596
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,940
Really appreciate your understanding.

597
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,180
If anything comes up
at Huashun Apothecary,

598
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,500
feel free to reach out to me anytime.

599
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,100
With those words from you,

600
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,940
I feel much more at ease.

601
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,420
Alright then,

602
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,540
I've got other matters to attend to,
so I'll take my leave.

603
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,660
Everything I said just now

604
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,580
stands for the next six months.

605
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,300
If you change your mind,

606
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,420
Shouyuan Apothecary will be ready
to welcome you anytime.

607
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,540
Got it.

608
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,300
We'll take our leave.

609
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,420
OK. Please take care.

610
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,620
No need to see us out.

611
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,740
Ma'am,

612
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
do you know how many people in Qizhou

613
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,740
are dying to get into
Shouyuan Apothecary,

614
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,420
just to work under Mr. Xia?

615
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,660
And yet you...?

616
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,620
Why be someone's subordinate?

617
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,460
If I'm in, I'm in charge.

618
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,380
So you're saying

619
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,740
Mr. Xia went to see that widow himself?

620
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:56,820
Yes.

621
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
That's odd.

622
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,380
At his age,

623
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,180
he shouldn't be interested
in a widow, should he?

624
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,180
What did they talk about?

625
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,780
I don't know.

626
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,300
But when Mr. Xia came out,

627
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,300
he said something like,

628
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,780
"Always welcome."

629
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,460
Feels like he was trying to persuade her

630
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,140
to join Shouyuan Apothecary.

631
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,020
What?

632
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,060
I only heard it through the grapevine.

633
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,100
But it's not impossible.

634
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,260
Think about it.

635
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,180
Chichun Apothecary is a mess right now,

636
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,980
and then there was
that whole Ziwan incident.

637
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,580
Mr. Xia may not have said anything,

638
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,180
but deep down,

639
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,220
he's definitely not happy with me.

640
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,540
Plus,

641
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,500
if he's into her

642
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,660
and she's keen

643
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,940
to join,

644
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,220
given that this used to be her shop

645
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,700
and she's from around here,

646
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,700
she'd slide right in.

647
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,180
You mean

648
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,540
Mr. Xia wants
to hand Chichun Apothecary over

649
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,220
to her?

650
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,180
That might actually be true.

651
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,740
No way.

652
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,620
So,

653
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,220
we need a serious move,

654
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,460
one that drives her out of Qizhou

655
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,860
for good.

656
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,540
Got it.

657
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,540
And now,

658
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,660
[Huashun Apothecary]
it's time to draw today's grand prize,

659
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,100
a coupon worth one silver dollar!

660
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,060
- Yeah!
- Wonderful!

661
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,420
Do they work the same?

662
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,700
Pretty much. Same effect,

663
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,820
just different flavor.

664
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,020
Ma'am,

665
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,260
we're out of Xiangsha Pills,

666
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,220
and Liuwei Pills, too,

667
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,780
and a few other medicines
need restocking as well.

668
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,780
Got it.

669
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,460
Ma'am,

670
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,300
Liao's shipment came in.

671
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,380
They threw in three more orders.

672
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,300
Okay, just set it down here.

673
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,780
Zhang's order is ready.

674
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,420
Zhu,

675
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,100
go deliver it.

676
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,620
What about the backyard?

677
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,140
Let Lin handle it after the prize draw.

678
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,780
Alright.

679
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,500
Ma'am, do you have any Hugu Plaster?

680
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,900
One moment. Jiang,

681
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,340
go help the customer.

682
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,380
What about the stuff in the backyard?

683
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,380
I'll take care of it.

684
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,260
Ma'am,

685
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,940
we seriously need more help.

686
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,980
I'm swamped.

687
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,860
Exactly. I'm off.

688
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,460
Shaohua.

689
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,140
Mother and I dropped by to see you.

690
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,460
Mother.

691
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,620
Your brother and I

692
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,140
have really missed you.

693
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,300
Things have been hectic at home lately.

694
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
We just couldn't manage.

695
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,260
As soon as I had a moment today,
I told Mother

696
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,300
to come check on you.

697
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,180
Yes.

698
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,220
Mother, have some tea.

699
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,820
You need something from me?

700
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,340
I heard...

701
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
Come on,

702
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
do we need a reason to visit?

703
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,940
I heard business is going well for you.

704
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,740
It's alright.

705
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,380
Shaohua, you're being modest.

706
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,700
Everyone in Qizhou knows

707
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,220
Huashun Apothecary

708
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,780
is doing incredibly well.

709
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,300
It's about to surpass

710
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,420
Chichun Apothecary.

711
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,020
Shaohua,

712
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,900
taking care of your child alone,

713
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,780
and managing this entire apothecary,

714
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,620
you've really got your hands full.

715
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,900
Take care.

716
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,220
Wang, where is Shaohua?

717
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,780
Her family's here.

718
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,780
They're chatting in the backyard.

719
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,020
Shaohua,

720
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,380
you've grown so weary.

721
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,260
Really.

722
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,820
Look at your hands.

723
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,380
They're all skin and bone.

724
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,940
Sure, it's tough,

725
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,140
but I don't mind.

726
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,060
That's not okay.

727
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,340
We know you've been going through a lot,

728
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,620
and it really hurts us,

729
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,020
especially Mother.

730
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,220
Shaohua, I've been thinking.

731
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
Your brother

732
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,620
is not doing much at home.

733
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,340
Maybe

734
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,740
he could come here and give you a hand?

735
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,300
Yes. Mother's got a great idea.

736
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,460
First,

737
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,100
you'll have a caring family member
by your side.

738
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,620
Second, the apothecary

739
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,460
is your brother's specialty.

740
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,420
With him helping out,

741
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,340
things can only improve.

742
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,780
What could he do if he came?

743
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,260
Oh, he could do plenty.

744
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,020
Anything

745
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,060
that involves dealing with people,
just let him take care of it.

746
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,220
He can manage people, money,
and the shop.

747
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,860
Shaohua, to put it simply,

748
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,700
once your brother's here,

749
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,860
you'll have nothing to worry about.

750
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,700
You can go home,

751
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,140
stay with Xuan, and enjoy
a peaceful life. Wouldn't that be nice?

752
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,020
So you're saying

753
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,580
I should let my brother
run Huashun Apothecary?

754
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,380
Right. Let your brother
handle the hard work,

755
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,820
while you take
a well-deserved break at home.

756
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,420
Just sit back and let him run the show.

757
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,780
Is that what my brother wants too?

758
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,900
He didn't say it outright,

759
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,060
but you know how couples are.

760
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,820
I can tell what he's thinking.

761
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,380
Then I suggest you give up on that idea.

762
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,620
Alright then,

763
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,020
what do you think would be fair?

764
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,020
Did any of you

765
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,140
invest any money in Huashun Apothecary?

766
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,780
Okay, maybe you didn't have the money.

767
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,300
You could've at least helped, right?

768
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,060
Did anyone lift a finger?

769
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,500
Fine, no money, no help, whatever.

770
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,660
But not even a single word of support?

771
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,300
Now that I've got the shop running,

772
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,700
and things are finally going well,

773
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,100
you show up with your ideas.

774
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,140
What, you think I'm a fool?

775
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,180
Shaohua, come on,

776
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,460
we didn't know before.

777
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,700
Now that we do,

778
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,900
we just want your brother

779
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,260
- to help you out.
- I don't need your help.

780
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,940
I've got my business under control.

781
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,100
If there's nothing more,

782
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,420
you can go now.

783
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,540
No, Shaohua,

784
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm not finished.

785
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,900
If you're set on managing

786
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,980
Huashun Apothecary yourself,

787
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,140
we can talk about it.

788
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,580
This is my business.

789
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,460
Why should I talk it over with you?

790
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,020
Shaohua, listen,

791
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,740
even the best need support, right?

792
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,340
No matter how capable you are,

793
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,020
can you really handle everything alone?

794
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,460
Of course not. You'll still need help.

795
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,100
Don't you agree?

796
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Why let strangers make that money

797
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,460
when your brother could?

798
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,460
And let's be honest,

799
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,180
can you really trust outsiders
to have your back?

800
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,780
You never really know
what someone's thinking.

801
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,900
But Shaozhong's not like that.

802
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,140
He's your brother,

803
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,260
your family by blood.

804
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,060
Shaohua,

805
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,820
I'll tell you straight.

806
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,020
Since we sold Chichun Apothecary,

807
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,700
your brother hasn't found a proper job.

808
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,100
He's been lazing around at home,

809
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,620
eating, sleeping, doing nothing.

810
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,260
If this goes on,

811
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,940
he'll lose himself.

812
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,660
Can you help him out?

813
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,500
Shaohua,

814
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,180
when we said

815
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,780
we want Shaozhong to help you,

816
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,340
we're too ashamed to tell the truth.

817
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,660
We're actually here

818
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,260
to ask you to help your brother.

819
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,420
Is that alright?

820
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,380
I need to give it some thought.

821
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
Have some tea.

822
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,060
I don't want that.

823
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,900
I'm so annoyed,
even water's giving me trouble.

824
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,620
Sis,

825
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,660
I heard Shaohua

826
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,820
started an apothecary in town

827
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,380
and it's doing great.

828
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,460
Yes.

829
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,580
She must be making good money, right?

830
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I have no idea.

831
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,020
Seriously? How can you not know?

832
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,460
You know how she is.

833
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,660
I can't control her at all.

834
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,100
However strong-willed she is,

835
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
you're her mother,

836
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,820
Xuan's grandmother,

837
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,700
the one in charge here.

838
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Sure, I know I'm in charge.

839
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,940
But I don't really get
how the business works.

840
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,340
You do know
how to handle the money, right?

841
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Mother, glad you came.

842
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,860
Have you had something to eat?

843
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:31,620
Yes, I have.

844
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,700
Just ate with your mother-in-law.

845
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,740
Go easy.

846
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,020
How's business at the apothecary today?

847
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,140
Pretty busy.

848
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,580
Shaohua's mother

849
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,060
and her sister-in-law came.

850
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,180
Didn't she say she cut ties with them?

851
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Guess not.

852
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,340
I saw them holding hands and talking.

853
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,100
So they've made up again?

854
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,620
No idea.

855
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,700
Mother, I'm off.

856
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,220
Go ahead.

857
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,780
Sis, I think

858
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,820
you should be careful with the money.

859
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,620
Don't let her sneak it back
to her family.

860
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,780
She's in charge of the apothecary.

861
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,140
If she decides
to send the money to her family,

862
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,740
I can't stop her.

863
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,380
Listen,

864
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,580
if you really want
to take charge of the money,

865
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,380
there's definitely a way.

866
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,180
Mother.

867
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,100
Come, Xuan.

868
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,300
Welcome back.

869
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,340
Ping,

870
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,940
heat up the mantou and that soup

871
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,700
and bring them over.

872
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,260
In a minute!

873
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,540
Let your mother take a break.

874
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,700
It's fine.

875
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,500
Here.

876
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,500
Careful, it's hot.

877
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,780
Shaohua, wipe your hands.

878
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,460
Go on.

879
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,100
Thanks, Mother.

880
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Shaohua,

881
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,380
look at that outfit. You've had it

882
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,940
since you married Dashun, haven't you?

883
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,820
It's all worn out.

884
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,900
I talked to the tailor.

885
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,980
He's making you two new ones tomorrow.

886
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,540
No need, Mother.

887
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,020
This one's still good.

888
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,740
You're out working now.

889
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,700
Looking presentable

890
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,140
makes the whole family proud.

891
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,220
Let's have the tailor
make a couple for Xuan too.

892
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,740
Is the Chinese New Year coming up?

893
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
That's all you care about, huh?

894
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,820
Xuan, didn't you say

895
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,220
you had something to tell Mother?

896
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,380
Mother, don't tire yourself out.

897
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,060
Try to come home earlier
and spend more time with me.

898
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,220
But I can't leave

899
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,500
until the shop closes.

900
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,660
Maybe you could hire a few more helpers.

901
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,100
Uncle Song seems like a good fit.

902
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,180
Mother, this was your idea, right?

903
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,420
Ping's mother came by today.

904
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,820
Sounds like

905
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,540
she's hoping

906
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,700
you could find something
for her son to do at the shop.

907
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,900
Mother.

908
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,460
Mother.

909
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,700
Mother.

910
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,940
Ershun?

911
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,460
Mother.

912
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,380
I'm back.

913
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,940
[Peking]

914
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,860
Sorry, we're closed.

915
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,140
Mr. Xia.

916
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,060
Yuan.

917
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,660
Finally,

918
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,660
you made it back.

919
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,940
It's been six years.

920
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,980
You're back at last.

921
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,460
You lost

922
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,860
both of the apothecaries?

923
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,380
They're gone?

924
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,220
What on earth did you do?

925
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,860
Tell me!

926
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,180
Mother.

927
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,580
I didn't want this either.

928
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,260
I got scammed.

929
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,140
Scammed?

930
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,060
Didn't you say everything was fine?

931
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,380
Didn't you say you could handle

932
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,460
what your father
and your brother left behind?

933
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,660
How did you end up

934
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,140
getting scammed?

935
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,020
You're pissing me off!

936
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,700
Grandmother, don't get upset.

937
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,380
Things were going so well.

938
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,220
Those scammers ruined everything.

939
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,380
They've got no conscience at all.

940
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,140
Scammers?

941
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,340
How could you be the one
to fall for them?

942
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,100
Mother.

943
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,180
Did Uncle do something wrong?

944
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,540
Xuan, remember.

945
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,860
Don't follow

946
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,700
in his footsteps.

947
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,660
Okay.

948
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,620
Xuan, come over.

949
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,300
Let me tell you something.

950
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,940
I made a complete fool of myself today.

951
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,540
Come on.

952
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,580
Alright, here's the thing...

953
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,140
Mother, hit me.

954
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,820
Just slap me. I deserve it.

955
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,460
You good-for-nothing.

956
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,300
Mother, go ahead.

957
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,540
Just knock some sense into me.

958
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,860
Go ahead, hit me as hard as you want.

959
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,260
- Hit me hard, Mother.
- Ershun!

960
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,020
How are we ever going
to get through this?

961
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,220
Seven times nine is sixty-three.

962
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,140
I can't believe this!

963
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,100
Six times nine is fifty-four.

964
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,380
Looks like your business empire

965
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,300
has grown a lot since before.

966
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,580
If you are here,
it'll expand even faster.

967
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,860
You've got top talent all around you.

968
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,780
No room for a small fry like me.

969
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
Come on, don't say that.

970
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,180
Be serious.

971
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,500
Now that you're back,
what are your plans?

972
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,300
How about we go to Shanghai together?

973
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,220
You've been there for years.

974
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,780
You must have a solid network.

975
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,540
And you studied abroad too.

976
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,780
Brothers should stick together.

977
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,740
I know you'll be a big help.

978
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,340
I'm leaving for France soon.

979
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,020
I came to Peking

980
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,140
to handle my study-abroad arrangements,

981
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,780
and to say goodbye to Mother

982
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,060
and you

983
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,780
before I leave.

984
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,300
France?

985
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,340
