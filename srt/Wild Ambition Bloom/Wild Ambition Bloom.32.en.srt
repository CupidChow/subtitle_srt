194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,300
and planning to buy one.

195
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,740
From this single deal,

196
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,570
she raked in
at least 2,000 silver dollars.

197
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,980
Enough to buy one.

198
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,770
I've also heard

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,810
she's dressing fashionably now,

200
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,100
like a rich lady.

201
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,890
Who is that man?

202
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,500
His family owns a cotton mill.

203
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,290
He just returned from studying in Paris

204
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,890
and started his own company.

205
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,140
Seems to trade rubber with foreigners.

206
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,290
But do you know

207
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,530
what his true identity is?

208
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,530
What?

209
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,340
A swindler.

210
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,890
How did you find out?

211
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,220
Right before you walked in,

212
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,340
he was inviting me to partner up

213
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,020
on a supposedly foolproof deal.

214
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,340
Mao,

215
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,500
how much capital

216
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,260
did you mention your business requires?

217
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,170
8,000 silver dollars.

218
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,620
Alright, when do you need it?

219
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,890
The sooner, the better.

220
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,620
If tomorrow,

221
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,620
that would be perfect.

222
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,140
Tomorrow won't work.

223
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,690
I'm looking at a house tomorrow.

224
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,410
Why not join me

225
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,890
to check out the house tomorrow?

226
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,460
Help me keep an eye out.

227
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,020
Then we can head to the exchange.

228
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,770
Alright, my pleasure.

229
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,340
Excuse me, are you Mr. Mao?

230
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,460
Yes.

231
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,140
This is a letter from Miss Bai.

232
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,460
Mao, I'm truly sorry.

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,770
My fiancé returned from abroad
unexpectedly.

234
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,220
We're getting married.

235
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm not going to see the house today.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,570
Don't try to contact me again.

237
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,100
Let's not keep in touch from now on.

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,890
Take care.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,100
As for the houses here,

240
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,460
the prices are a bit steep.

241
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,180
That doesn't matter.

242
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,890
But I want a good house.

243
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,020
Ms. Zhou, rest assured.

244
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm showing you

245
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,620
the finest ones in Shanghai.

246

Come, let's take a look inside.

247
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,130
Alright.

[1931]

249
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,890
Good.

250
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,180
Does this style come in other colors?

251
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,250
Also gray and coffee.

252
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,180
Please get me one set of each.

253
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,100
Of course!

254
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,820
One set is enough.

255
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,980
Not enough for changes.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
At least three sets.

257
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,530
I don't want them anymore.

258
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,850
What does this mean?

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,460
I won't let you pay for me again.

260
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,700
But you're going abroad to study.

261
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,180
You should dress properly.

262
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,300
Can't let others look down on us!

263
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,730
I don't want to study overseas.

264
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,610
I want to work at your pharmacy.

265
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,730
We don't need a middle school student.

266
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,770
Shaohua,

267
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,220
you've covered my schooling

268
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,340
and living expenses these years.

269
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,770
Now that I've graduated,

270
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,130
I shouldn't let you pay for me.

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,220
I should repay you.

272
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,300
Then come with me.

273
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,000
[Western Medicine Department]

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,580
Look!

275
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,770
These are Western drugs.

276
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,620
To treat headaches and fevers,

277
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,570
a dose of TCM costs few coins.

278
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,170
But a single box

279
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,890
of aspirin costs three silver dollars!

280
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,690
When working as a child laborer,

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,620
I only earned two silver dollars a week.

In this entire department store,

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,620
except Renshen, edible bird's nests

284
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,740
and other supplements,

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,890
no TCM is sold here.

286
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,140
Indeed.

287
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,570
This is what frustrates me.

288
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,810
Why does TCM, with its profundity,

289
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,890
struggle to stand tall

290
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,340
before Western drugs?

291
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,530
Because of efficacy?

292
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,890
When it comes to efficacy,

293
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,530
TCM holds its own against Western drugs.

294
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,530
The ancestral secret formulas

295
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,020
are treasures.

296
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,220
Due to the blind admiration
for foreign things?

297
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,530
Perhaps partly true.

298
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,050
But not the whole story.

299
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,170
Mainly because we cling to the old ways.

300
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,810
For centuries,

301
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,930
we've had only workshops,

302
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,020
not factories;

303
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,930
only craftsmanship, but no technology;

304
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,500
only inheritance, but no innovation.

305
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,930
So how do we innovate?

306
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,100
You'll tell me how.

Western pharmaceutical processes

313
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,500
and how they run
pharmaceutical factories,

314
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,740
and explore a new path for TCM.

315
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,650
I understand.

316
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,020
Cheng Hui,

317
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,930
I hope that one day TCM

318
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,530
can stay with Western drugs

319
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,530
and the ancestral formulas

320
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,770
can benefit more patients.

321
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,020
I also hope that someday

322
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,410
TCM will thrive, grow,

323
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,690
and go global.

324
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,860
Rest assured.

325
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,170

327
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,140
We must elevate TCM

328
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,100
and take it global.

329
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,570

from northeast China by year-end,

335
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,530
we'll suffer at least these losses.

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,170
In this case,

337
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,530
we can't maintain our foothold here.

He's barely keeping himself afloat.

340
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,890
Because he clashed with the Japanese?

341
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,170
They offered him very favorable terms,

342
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,050
but instead of accepting,

343
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,410
he cursed them out loudly.

His temper

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,050
has earned him respect,

00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,620
yet left people shaking their heads.

347
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,380
But

348
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,650
he brought himself trouble

349
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,690

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,890
this could be our chance.

384
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,530
Tell us who,

385
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,260
where, when,

386
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,220
and how much was pocketed

387
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,770
from our donations.

388
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,020
Am I not being clear enough?

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,810
Want me to spell it out more explicitly?

390
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,530
I insist.

you're fabricating false charges!

392
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,660
I can sue you for defamation.

393
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,090
Defamation? How absurd!

394
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,460
Wen's Pharmacy and Jujing Apothecary,

395
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,130
while publicly shouting

396
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,770

397
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,940

with the Japanese.

398
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,130
Isn't that the truth?

399
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,260
Rubbish! Wen's Pharmacy

400
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,370
has never done business

401
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,500
with the Japanese!

402
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,700
Then let me ask you this.

403
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,770
We all know the northeast market

404
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,500
is under Japanese control, right?

405
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,020
We know that.

406
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,530
Our inventories

407
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,660
of herbs from the northeast

408
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,900
have run dry, right?

409
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,500
Exactly!

410
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,940
But your shelves are fully stocked.

411
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,090
Why is that?

412
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,850
Mr. Tian,

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,980
you've run businesses for decades,

414
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,850
yet don't you know stockpiling?

415
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:03,610
Stockpiling?

416
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,850
If you mean common herbs like Chenpi,

417
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,290
Banxia, or Mahuang,

418
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,530
I'd buy that excuse.

419
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,740
But your shelves are bursting

420
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,850

most urgently needed herbs.

421
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,570
Ask everyone

422
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,370
if they believe
you're not doing business

423
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,260
with the Japanese.

424
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,020
Mr. Xia has extensive connections

425
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,290
and supply chains in the northeast,

426
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,220
so he can ensure a stable inventory.

427
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,980
What's so suspicious about that?

428
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,130
I'm afraid his chains are the Japanese.

429
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,940
What did you say?

430
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,850
Fellow colleagues,

431
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,740
at this hour of national peril,

432
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,090
we share a hatred of the Japanese.

433
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,700
Yet certain individuals,

434
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,220
like Xia Yuan, Wen Zhiqiu,
and Chu Shaohua,

435
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,850
profiteer from the nation's suffering
by consorting with the Japanese.

436
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,330
They don't deserve
to be Chinese citizens,

437
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,660
let alone the members of TCM Guild.

As a member
of the Guild's Council of Chairpersons,

439
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,980
I propose

440
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,980
to expel them.

441
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,050
Meanwhile,

442
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,290

443
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,700

445
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,260

446
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,370
- Remove him.
- Agreed!

447
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,900
Agreed!

448
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,460

this is reckless defamation!

449

453

depends on a vote of all council members

454

455
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,460
Fine!

Now let's hold the vote

457
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,850

This is great.

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,370
Mr. Xia.

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,770
Excuse me.

463
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,130
What's wrong?

464
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,370
Just now at the TCM Guild,

465
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,770
based on our ample herbal supply

466
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,460
from northeast China,

467
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,370
Mr. Tian accused us

468
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,940
of doing business with the Japanese

469
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,130
and proposed to remove you.

470
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,290
Mr. Xia, my suggestion is

471
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,330
to disclose all purchase records now

472
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,130
to prove our innocence.

473
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,180
Remove me?

474

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,290
may be misled by his claims.

477
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,770
He just

478
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,290
won't give up his scheming!

479
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,500
If we show our resolve to resist Japan

480
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,770
and back it with real action,

481
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,610

May I introduce someone?

484
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,900
Mr. Komura.

485
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,180
He's my old friend

486
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,980
and now my business partner.

487
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,370
Mr. Morikazu Komura

488
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,810
from Komura Pharmaceutical Company.

489
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,220
Nice to meet you.

490
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,130
This might seem sudden to you,

491
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,810
but here's how I see it.

492
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,050
Supplies from Mr. Han have dried up.

493
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,700
Luckily, we have the Komura clan.

494
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,260
As their long-time partner,

495
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,370
I have full confidence in the quality

496
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,810
of their pharmaceutical products.

497
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,260
They established a branch
in northeast China,

498
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,500
so I signed with them

499
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,530
a long-term supply contract at once.

500
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,530
I've also secured
exclusive distribution rights

501
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,090
in Shanghai for many rare herbs

00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,660
from Japan and Japanese-occupied Korea.

503
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,610
The Japanese forces
just occupied northeast China.

504
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,660
So it's inappropriate

505
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,130
to sign the contract now.

506
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,700
Yes, you're right.

507

Sino-Japanese relations
are at a critical stage,

508
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,660
but I believe this is only temporary.

509
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,500
We should take a long-term view.

510
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,570
Think about it.

What ordinary people care about

512
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,330
is if they can eat their fill

513
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,290
and cure illnesses.

just watch if they'll buy them.

00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,700
Mr. Xia, this concerns integrity.

519
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,050
We cannot sign this contract.

520
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,420
But I've signed it.

521
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,570
Then we must break it.

522
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,460

That's all that matters to me.

537

I don't care what you mentioned.

538
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,810
Nor can I handle with it.

539
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,180

Go ahead, curse me!

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,420
Voting begins.

572
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,770
Shanghai TCM Guild

573
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,180
is patriotic.

574
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,740
A traitor can't be our chairman!

575
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,980
Slogans alone cannot advance a nation.

576
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,330
Only by doing solid work in industry

577
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,290
can we truly show patriotism.

578
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,610
I may not be talented,

579
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,260
but I sincerely handle practical matters
for the guild

580
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,370
and seek benefits for its members.

581
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,610
I earnestly hope for your support.

582
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,130
Yu, well done!

583
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,980
You're my friend now.

584
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,940
Song Shichao,

585
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,370
what are you doing?

586
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,460
You're betraying your ancestors!

587
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,530
Look at me!

588
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,810
I renounce our friendship!

589
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,220
Don't come to me again!

590
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,770
I can't believe it!

591
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,130
Look at me!

592
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,940
Dare speak to me now?

593
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,770
Good for you!

594
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,900
Let's drink later.

595
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,530
Such a loser!

596
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,290
Mr. Tian!

597
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,850
What's wrong?

598
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,810
Let me remind you.

599
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,980
This is a voting venue.

600
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,220
If you cause trouble again,

601
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,610
I will kick you out.

602
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,610
By what right?

603
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,940
It's six to six now.

604
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,570
Who hasn't voted yet?

605
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,980
Now only Mr. Wen from Wen's Pharmacy

606
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,050
holds the deciding vote.

607
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,090
He is not qualified to vote

608
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,660
as he sides with Xia Yuan.

609
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,420
Mr. Tian,

610
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,610
Mr. Wen is also a council member.

611
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,940
Why did you say that?

612
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,700
Because he is Xia Yuan's lackey.

613
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,330
So what?

614
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,660
Mr. Tian, please go out.

615
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,740
Why should I?

616
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,130
If you refuse to leave,

617
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,570
your vote will be deemed invalid.

618
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,220
Get out!

619
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,660
Mr. Tian, please.

620
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,460
You all remember this!

621
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,330
I'll settle accounts with you later!

622
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,770
Traitors will never end well!

623
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,420
Such losers!

624
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,810
Two-faced scoundrels!

625
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,130
Sir, calm down now.

626
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,220
I can't.

627
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,220
No benefit in following Xia Yuan.

628
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,980
He leads a pack of traitors!

629
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,770
Mr. Wen,

630
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,850
please cast your vote.

631
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,660
He agreed to remove him.

632
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,500
Never expected that!

633
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,780
[Spring Garden Restaurant]
I thought Mr. Xia had won.

634
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,220
Never expected Wen Zhiqiu would do that.

635
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,060
He only has today

636
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,940
because of Mr. Xia.

637
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,060
Yet he was being ungrateful

638
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,570
and slapped Mr. Xia right in the face!

639
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,850
I think he is crazy.

640
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,260
Mr. Tian must have bribed him

641
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,460
with a large sum of money.

642
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,700
The conditions Mr. Tian offered

643
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,610
are better than Mr. Xia's?

644
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,260
Right, speaking of that,

645
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,890
Mr. Xu, I'll pick up the goods tomorrow.

646
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,610
Give me the discount as promised.

647
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,410
Don't worry.

648
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,780
Mr. Xia always keeps his word.

649
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,780
His word is his bond.

650
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,890
And me too.

651
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,130
Don't worry, I won't forget.

652
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,810
Rest assured.

653
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,540
My word is my bond.

654
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,740
Go ahead and eat.

655
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,090
I'll go for some fresh air.

656
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,130
Come on!

657
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,170
Enjoy the meal!

658
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,810
Okay.

659
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,700
Please.

660
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,410
Please!

661
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,020
Mr. Xia,

662
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,540
why come out here?

663
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,300
Just for some fresh air.

664
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,740
Shall I brew you some tea?

665
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:43,460
No need.

666
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,940
Talk with me.

667
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,570
Sure.

668
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,300
You really keep nice fishes here!

669
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,980
A Feng Shui master suggested

670
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,020
placing a fish tank right here

671
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,410
to keep some fishes.

672
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,610
They're all plump and round now!

673
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,130
Why isn't my business thriving?

674
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,020
You eat without lifting a fin!

675
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,060
Stuff yourselves while you can.

676
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,020
Good they eat without lifting a fin.

677
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,300
My only fear is that after eating,

678
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,610
they might turn around and bite you.

679
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,700
They don't bite!

680
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,410
I meant the "dog".

681
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,940
Then you must not keep it.

682
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,740
Chase it out.

683
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,650
Right!

684
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,220
Besides,

685
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,370
kick it!

686
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,020
Fine.

687
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,410
We'll do as you say.

688
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,130
How's the food tonight?

689
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,650
I was just drinking.

690
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,060
Haven't had a single bite yet.

691
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,060
That won't do!

692
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,260
I'll have them make you hot noodles.

693
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,090
Don't bother.

694
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,850
I insist!

695
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,060
Nothing settles your stomach

696
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,060
like hot noodles after drinking.

697
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,130
Miss Bai,

698
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,780
thank you.

699
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,890
That sounds too impersonal.

700
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,780
Just call me Erniu.

701
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,850
I won't call you Mr. Xia,

702
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,220
but Yuan instead.

703
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,780
Yuan?

704
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,330
If that feels weird to you,

705
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,890
I can call you sir

706
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,130
or still Mr. Xia.

707
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,810
No,

708
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,300
let's stick with Yuan.

709
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,810
Please drop by often
to support my business!

710
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,940
I'll come every single day.

711
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,810
Deal?

712
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,610
Word of honor!

[Richards Hotel]

714
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,170
Ms. Chu,

715
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,650
I came by today

716
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,570
to give you something.

717
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,890
Thank you.

718
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,090
This piece

719
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:14,090
was from Xia Chu's father.

720
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,300
Two in total.

721
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,940
One went to Shufen.

722
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,330
I wanted to

723
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,220
give it to you on your wedding day
with Xia Chu.

724
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,610
Never expected…

725
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,610
Here, wear it.

726
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,260
Madam, this is far too valuable.

727
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,330
I can't.

728
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,850
All these years,

729
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,780
this was my only remaining wish.

730
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,850
It aligns with Xia Chu's desire.

731
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,740
All these years,

732
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,650
I've regarded you as part of us.

733
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,170
If you don't mind,

734
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,090
call me Mother.

735
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,700
Please take it.

736
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,810
By the way,

00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,060
today Xia Yuan

738
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,500
wants to talk with you.

740
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,540
Mr. Xia.

741
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,020
Please talk.

Be careful.

00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,330
Have a seat.

747
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,090
I never expected

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,780
Wen Zhiqiu

749
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,020
stabbed me in the back!

750
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,020
He voted to remove you

751
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,540
because he couldn't stomach

752
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,540
you defected to the Japanese.

753
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,700
I only do business with them.

754
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,610
Instead,

755
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,940
he defected to Mr. Tian!

756
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,130
No connection

757
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,540
between them.

758
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,330
But mark my words.

759
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,300
There will be one in the future.

760
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,370
So Shaohua,

761
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,700
we must do something.

762
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,170
We?

763
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,460
You currently hold

764
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,940
about 20% of the shares, huh?

765
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,900
22%.

766
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,090
Perfect!

767
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,460
Add my 30% share to yours,

768
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,020
and we'll easily kick Wen Zhiqiu

769
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,650
out of Wen's Pharmacy.

770
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,290
That doesn't add up,

771
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,500
Mr. Xia.

772
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,980
Didn't you only own 20% the shares?

773
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,380
Yes.

774
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,090
Originally, I only had 20%.

775
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,860
But one year ago,

776
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,460
he traded me 10% of shares

777
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,860
and one silver dollar

778
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,460
for Chichun Apothecary's signboard.

779
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,540
[Chichun Apothecary]
Now the signboard belongs to me.

780
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,730
How much did he sell it to you for?

781
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,940
I'll double that price.

782
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,860
Ten silver dollars.

783
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,610
You didn't know about this?

784
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,460
Seriously?

785
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,900
All along, I thought

786
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,690
he did it for your favor.

787
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,730
Anyway,

788
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,650
Shaohua,

789
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,820
I know

790
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,540
you're destined for greatness.

791
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,980
Facing such a rare opportunity,

792
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,130
drop Wen Zhiqiu

793
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,210
and partner with me instead.

794
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,770
I vow

795
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,250
in the near future,

796
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,420
you shall become

797
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,250
the most powerful woman

798
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,380
in Shanghai's TCM world

799
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,500
and across China's
pharmaceutical industry.

800
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,820
Mr. Xia,

801
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,420
I'm not one of your people.

802
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,250
What do you mean by that?

803
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,340
Our paths diverge,

804
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,290
so we cannot plan together.

805
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,940
Also because I work with the Japanese?

806
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,540
I merely do business with them.

807
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,250
It's about national righteousness.

808
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,980
National righteousness?

809
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,420
That's empty rhetoric.

810
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,090
Family interests are what matter.

811
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,460
No nation,

812
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,020
no home.

813
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,570
Shaohua,

814
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,540
the current Nanjing Government

815
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,290
is secretly working with Japan.

816
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,820
This is the inevitable trend.

817
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,770
Your insistence

818
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,690
will be futile.

819
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,340
You and I

820
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,340
are not cut from the same cloth.

821
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,500
Not only am I

822
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,060
a merchant,

823
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,170
but also a Chinese person.

824
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,610
Chu Shaohua,

825
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,570
ever since we met,

826
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,090
you've turned me down thrice.

827
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,500
This

828
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,250
is your last chance.

829
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,650
I've never believed in

830
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,170
such things as the last chance.

831
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,860
All I believe

832
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,500
is if a person is alive,

833
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,380
he always has another chance.

834
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,540
That's right.

835
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,020
Xia Chu is dead.

836
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,380
It seems you've

837
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,090
completely forgotten him.

838
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,690
He dedicated his entire life

839
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,420
to serving the people,

840
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,090
the country

841
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,210
and the nation

842
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,540
until he sacrificed his own life.

843
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,420
Mr. Xia,

844
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,940
it's you who forgot him.

845
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,130
Cut the flattery.

846
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,570
I knew ages ago

847
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,570
that you've got involved

848
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,090
with Wen Zhiqiu.

849
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,940
Xia Yuan,

850
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,980
Xia Chu has been gone for four years.

851
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,860
Even if I get involved with someone,

852
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,500
it's my freedom.

853
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,900
See to yourself then.

854
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,650
Wen Zhiqiu,

855
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,650
the signboard of Chichun Apothecary

856
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,460
was traded for 10%
of shares?

857
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,170
Xia Yuan told you?

858
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,290
Yet you said it cost one silver dollar.

859
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,380
Have you lost your mind?

860
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,860
Why trade shares with him?

861
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,460
He only holds 30% of the share.

862
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,210
Do you realize

863
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,540
if I team up with him,

864
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,340
I can kick your ass out

865
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,690
of Wen's Pharmacy

866
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,540
But you won't.

867
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,020
How can you be so sure?

868
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,090
Do you know what terms

869
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,290
he offered me?

870
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,090
You won't go
no matter how much he offers.

871
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,210
You think you know me again?

872
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,020
Since you claim to know me,

873
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,900
you must know I adore money deeply.

874
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,650
Yet beyond that,

875
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,340
there's still a place for homeland

876
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,570
and idealism in your heart.

877
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,610
You're utterly foolish!

878
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,650
Wen's Pharmacy nearly collapsed
under your watch!

879
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,770
Henceforth, report to me

880
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,340
before making any major decision.

881
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,730
Should a boss consult his subordinate
before acting?

882
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm not only your subordinate…

883
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,460
You're also my shareholder,

884
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,610
my partner,

885
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,090
and my…

886
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,820
Wen's Pharmacy.

887
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:28,860
Fine.

888
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,210
I see.

889
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,420
Sir,

890
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,820
I've got the big picture.

891
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,860
Not only have we

892
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,340
terminated all cooperation
with Wen's Pharmacy,

893
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,980
but also Zhenglin Apothecary,

894
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,210
Guangwang Apothecary
and Shengsheng Company

895
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,420
have officially notified Wen's Pharmacy

896
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,980
as of today
they'll cease supplying them.

897
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,860
They can't make bricks without straw.

898
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,650
Let me see

899
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,650
how they will fulfill those orders!

900
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,090
I've notified all other herb dealer

901
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,380
and clearly said whoever dares

902
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,900
supply Wen's Pharmacy

903
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,100
will face severe consequences.

904
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,500
Soon, Wen's Pharmacy

905
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,020
will stand utterly alone.

906
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,460
Sir,

907
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,370
have you done the math?

908
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,940
You mean

909
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,060
1,000 killed and 800 spent?

910
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,060
But I think

911
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,170
it is the other way around.

912
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,580
You

913
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,690
are short-sighted.

914
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,290
Fixated only on immediate profits

915
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,540
while ignoring future gains.

916
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,540
Speaking of the future,

917
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,170
I hold little optimism for the Japanese.

918
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,100
Rest assured.

919
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,730
I won't cling to the Japanese forever.

920
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,290
Right now, we have five orders

921
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,860
due before the Chinese New Year.

922
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,210
If raw herbs run out,

923
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,690
we cannot meet those deadlines.

924
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,980
According to the contract,

925
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,810
we must compensate
at least 35,000 silver dollars.

926
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,900
With post-holiday delivery orders,

927
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,980
it'll amount to 200,000 silver dollars.

928
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,380
Yet currently,

929
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,540
our available funds

930
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,100
are merely 12,000 silver dollars.

931
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,250
Our brand is valued
at 500,000 silver dollars.

932
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,580
But Xia Yuan is also a shareholder.

933
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,330
If he opposes it,

934
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,610
neither transfer
nor mortgage can proceed.

935
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,210
This leaves us with only two choices.
