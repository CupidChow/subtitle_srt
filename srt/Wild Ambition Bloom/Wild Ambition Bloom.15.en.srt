00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,620
I can communicate with foreigners
without any trouble.

191
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,500
Now that I've graduated,

192
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm looking for a stable job.

193
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,780
And I do have experience
in this line of work.

194
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,140
Okay, for example?

195
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,980
I used to work in a bank.

196
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,420
Actually, that song

197
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,140
didn't start out in Japanese.

198
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,060
The original version was in English.

199
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,620
I happened to learn it, actually.

200
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,780
Let me sing it for you.

201
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:22,300

♪I've been dreaming of home and mother♪

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,940
You know how to sing this song?

208
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:44,900
Come on in.

209
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,900
Can you speak English?

210
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,460
Nod for yes, shake for no.

211
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,380
No.

212
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,660
So where did you learn that song?

213
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,140
A long time ago,

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,020
a friend taught me.

215
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,020
Well, isn't that a coincidence.

216
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,500
I'd bet in all of Shanghai,

217
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,100
only the two of us know

218
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,260
[Shen Mengmei, Director]
the English version of that song,

219
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,700
and you barely even speak English.

220
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,540
Ms. Shen, I may not speak English,

221
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,300
but I can write.

222
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,780
I can use both hands
on the abacus at the same time,

223
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,140
and I can do mental calculations
up to ten thousand.

224
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Also,

225
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,540
I have an excellent memory.

226
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
No matter how big the number,

227
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,620
I only need one glance
to remember it exactly.

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,140
Besides,

229
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,620
I've run a business before,

230
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,900
so I have no trouble

231
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,140
communicating with customers.

232
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Ms. Shen,

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,980
could you give me a chance,

234
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
make an exception
and hire me as a shop assistant here?

235
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,700
You're here to apply?

236
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,540
Yes.

237
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,060
I didn't attend middle school,

238
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,620
so I don't have a diploma.

239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,420
So the Personnel Department

240
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,500
can't let me register.

241
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,860
You're the head of Personnel.

242
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,060
You have the final say.

243
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,540
Sorry,

244
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,740
but our hiring criteria require

245
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,460
at least a middle school education.

246
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,940
If you don't meet that,

247
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,820
we won't be able to move forward.

248
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,460
I'll excuse myself now.

249
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,500
Welcome.

250
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,540
Mommy, I love you.

251
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,140
I love you, too.

252
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,340
Bye bye.

253
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,340
Bye.

254
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,460
Mommy, I love you.

255
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,220
I think not having a diploma
is one reason.

256
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,060
But an even bigger reason is

257
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,660
that I don't know how to dress up.

258
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,300
Right,

259
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,620
I've heard a lot of people say

260
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,540
that many shops are hiring these days.

261
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,100
But I still want to
give Evernew Department a shot.

262
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
You don't have to
stick to just one option.

263
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,100
They offer a base salary
of 30 silver dollars.

264
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,220
But they don't want you.

265
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,340
I feel like if I could

266
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,460
just change up my look a bit,

267
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,100
I might still have a chance.

268
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,460
But first,

269
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,780
I'd need a pair of stylish shoes,

270
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,300
a proper outfit

271
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,340
to match,

272
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,260
and those shiny stockings

273
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,660
they wear.

274
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,060
And if I had a handbag too,
that'd be perfect.

275
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,460
I'll take care of all that.

276
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,220
Honestly, even saying it out loud

277
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,460
feels unreal.

278
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,420
You're really going along with this?

279
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,380
Do you even know
how much that stuff costs?

280
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,260
You could shine shoes for a whole year
and still not afford it.

281
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,140
Maybe you could teach me to read, write,
and do a bit of math.

282
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Just enough

283
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,860
to get through the job interview.

284
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,380

something sad from the past
come to mind?

[Wolff Pen]
This is called a fountain pen.

367
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,140
Way easier to use than a brush pen.

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260

you can handle a fountain pen.

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,020
Just go with this Parker pen.

375
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,140
It suits you perfectly.

376
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,500
So you're a Tiger after all.

377
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,460
How do you open this?
Can you help me with it?

378
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,100
With your talent, selling pens

379
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,940
is such a waste.

380
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,220
Don't you think

381
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,500
this brown one suits me better?

382
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,780
Sir,

383
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,780
are you buying or not?

384
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,740
If you're not,

385
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,380
don't waste my time.

386
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,220
Are you upset?

387
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,460
Of course not.

388
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:10,820
Hi there.

389
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,460
Could I take a look

390
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,580
at that tiger-head pen from earlier?

391
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,660
Of course.

392
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,260
Thanks.

393
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,300
Sir,

394
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,540
this pen

395
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,420
is elegant and refined.

396
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,420
I think it really suits your style.

397
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,300
Also,

398
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,300
the color of the barrel

399
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,860
goes perfectly
with what you're wearing today.

400
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,100
It's a pen for a gentleman

401
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,580
like you.

402
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,780
It brings good fortune.

403
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,620
How about taking one home?

404
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
That was a good pitch.

405
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,340
But brushes are more my style.

406
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,460
Fountain pens? Not really my thing.

407
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,540
He's not buying.

408
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,660
So may I ask,

409
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,580
what do you do for a living?

410
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,780
I'm in business.

411
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,660
Mind sharing what kind of business?

412
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,140
Take a guess.

413
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,340
You're a physician?

414
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,900
How did you find out?

415
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,940
Well, you've got this lovely scent

416
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,540
of herbal medicine on you.

417
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,700
Really?

418
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,820
In that case,

419
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,660
I think you could really use
that fountain pen.

420
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,060
But I usually write prescriptions
with a brush.

421
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,900
When you're at your practice, yes,

422
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,780
a brush gives off
a classic physician vibe.

423
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,340
But when you're visiting patients,

424
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,940
lugging around a brush?

425
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,340
That's hardly convenient.

426
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,220
If you had a fountain pen

427
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,100
you could carry with you,

428
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,620
it'd be a real necessity.

429
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,900
Excuse me,

430
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,460
mind showing me
that tiger-head pen again?

431
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,060
Thanks.

432
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,820
Just one thing,

433
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,700
I don't know how to use a fountain pen.

434
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,900
No need to worry about that.

435
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
This fountain pen

436
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,580
is way easier to handle than a brush.

437
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,620
Let me put it this way.

438
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,500
Writing with a fountain pen

439
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,340
doesn't mean you'd know
how to handle a brush.

440
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
But if you're good with a brush,

441
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,660
then a fountain pen
will be a breeze for you.

442
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,180
After all that,

443
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,300
you might as well give it a try.

444
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,380
May I? Thanks.

445
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,660
Siwu decoction.
[*"Siwu" means "four ingredients".]

446
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,180
You know traditional Chinese medicine?

447
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,860
Lucky guess, honestly.

448
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Have we met before?

449
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,500
Really?

450
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,060
What's your name?

451
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,660
I...

452
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,260
Here's the deal.

453
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,780
Miss Tiger,

454
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,180
if she tells me

455
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,660
her name and where she works,

456
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,300
I'll take the pen.

457
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,540
She just came on board

458
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,940
as a new sales assistant.

459
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,740
I'm Zhu Sha.

460
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,060
Miss, your shoes are all set.

461
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,660
Miss Daisy,

462
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,260
is there anything I can do for you?

463
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,700
Bring me my coat,

464
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,260
hat, shoes, and handbag.

465
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,020
You're leaving already?

466
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,940
Don't you usually stay for a few hours?

467
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,260
What's the rush today?

468
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,100
Something came up at home.
I need to get back.

469
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,940
What is it?
Probably not that urgent, right?

470
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,020
Why are you asking so many questions?

471
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,260
Hurry up and bring my clothes.

472
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,500
So here's the thing, Miss Daisy.

473
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,980
Our boss just mentioned

474
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,460
if you stay for a full two hours today,

475
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,540
you'll get a gift,

476
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,260
a free voucher.

477
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,380
I don't want anything.

478
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,820
Just bring me my clothes.

479
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,580
Alright.

480
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,620
Wang,

481
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,380
go get Miss Daisy's clothes.

482
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Don't forget.

483
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,700
Got it!

484
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,620
Miss Daisy, we've got
a lot of guests today,

485
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,420
and a lot of clothes too.

486
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,180
Would you like to relax in the game room
while we look?

487
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,980
Get in and help him.

488
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,140
Alright.

489
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,700
Hope to see you again soon.

490
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I'll come to you next time too.

491
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,580
Ni Xiangying.

492
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,260
Is that how you talk to a customer?

493
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,740
It wasn't my fault.

494
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,780
The customer was being...

495
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,500
You should learn from Miss Zhu.

496
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,140
Come on, I'll take you
to the Personnel Department.

497
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,340
Miss Zhu, which department
would you like to join?

498
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
You seem to know quite a bit
about traditional Chinese medicine.

499
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,220
Is it something that runs in the family?

500
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,060
Not really.

501
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,500
Would you like
to join Shenyan Department?

502
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,780
I got this job
in the Stationery Department.

503
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,940
Maybe I'll just stay there.

504
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,020
Sure.

505
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,020
So here's

506
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,740
how it goes,

507
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,900
the first month is a probation period.

508
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Base salary is 15 silver dollars.

509
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,700
If your performance is good,

510
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,340
it goes up to 30 after a month,

511
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
plus commission on sales.

512
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,060
I'll give it my best.

513
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,380
Miss Daisy.

514
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,740
This isn't mine.

515
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,700
Please hold on a moment.

516
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,660
Miss Daisy.

517
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,460
Not that one.

518
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,140
I'll keep looking.

519
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Miss Daisy.

520
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,780
How many times do I have to say it?

521
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,020
It's a long black coat.

522
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,940
Black. Don't you understand?

523
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,140
Open your eyes and take a good look.

524
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,580
Does this look black to you?

525
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,900
I'm sorry.

526
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,860
I'll look again.

527
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,220
Forget it. I'll do it myself.

528
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,140
Miss Daisy, you can't go in there.

529
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:07,820
Why?

530
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,260
It's...

531
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
It's a mess.

532
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,180
Step aside.

533
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,260
There's a cockroach!

534
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Manager!

535
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
What on earth is going on?

536
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,540
I have no idea.

537
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,580
How could you not know?

538
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,940
I hung

539
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,180
that outfit

540
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,540
on the rack over there.

541
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,420
And then, in the blink of an eye,
it was gone.

542
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,100
Find Miss Daisy's coat.

543
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,660
Immediately!

544
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm incredibly sorry.

545
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,540
He's new here,

546
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,540
still getting up to speed.

547
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,660
I don't think that's the issue.

548
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,780
I think he's got sticky fingers.

549
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,340
Miss Daisy.

550
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,180
You're here.

551
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,820
Yes.

552
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,620
I want a full investigation.

553
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,620
Will do.

554
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,660
Wang.

555
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,300
Here.

556
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm so sorry.

557
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,100
My bad.

558
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,940
The shoes!

559
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,660
Please let me go!

560
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
Just give me one more chance.

561

everyone says you're a real saint.

574

It's all my fault.

If I'd brought that outfit back

576
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,660
a little earlier,

577
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,460
you wouldn't have taken that beating.

578
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,020
As long as it helped you get the job,

579
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,020
then it was worth it.

580
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,660
But I ended up costing you the job.

581

That job?

582
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,380
If it weren't for helping you
get the outfit,

583
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,660
I wouldn't have taken it
in the first place.

Sir,

620
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,060
you mentioned

621
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,180
that you usually use brush pens.

622
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,940
That's right.

623
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,980
If you're used to them,

624
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,260
switching to a fountain one
can feel a bit awkward at first.

625
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,140
But don't worry.

626
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,580
That feeling usually goes away
after a few days.

627
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,620
How many days will that take?

628
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,140
Well, that depends on
how often you use the pen

629
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,420
and how much pressure
you apply when writing.

630
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,980
In most cases, it should feel better
after about a week.

631
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,860
A week?

Let me put it this way.

660
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,300
There are only eight of these
in Shanghai.

661
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,260
And as you know, Parker pens

662
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,380
rarely go on sale.

663
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,380
Right now, you can get it at 24% off.

664
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,980
It's a rare opportunity.

665
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,380
But I already have one.

666
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,420
Taking two pens
is what we call doubling the luck!

667
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,860
And they're heirloom-worthy.

668
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,460
How much did you say it was again?

669
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,260
Ten dollars to start with.

670
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,420
With the voucher, just seven point six.

671
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,580
Still not exactly cheap.

672
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,340
But its collectible value
is nothing to scoff at.

673
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,140
Well then, I guess
I have no choice but to buy it.

674
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,180
Exactly.

675
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,300
You'll regret it

676
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,380
if you let this chance slip away.

677
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,060
Alright, I'll take it.

678
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,100

00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,780
I'm buying this pen

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,300

681
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,460

Honestly, compared to me,

687
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,020

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,340
Let me try that one.

744
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,220
Sure.

745
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,820
Miss Zhu,

746
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,380
the Personnel Department
just issued a notice.

747
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,220
You'll be officially hired next week.

748
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,540
Really?

749
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,980
I thought I had to intern
for a full month.

750
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,220
You've been fast-tracked.

751
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,740
Thank you so much.

752
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,660
You earned it.

753
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,500
Zhu Sha,

754
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,420
congratulations.

755
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,140
Thanks.

756
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,900
Back then, all our bonuses

757
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,820
were thanks to Xiangying.

758
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,500
Looks like we'll be counting on you
from now on.

759
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,100
I can't take all the credit.

760
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,660
We're all in it together.

761
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,060
Looks like we've got

762
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,100
a new Parker Beauty in the department.

763
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,220
Don't say that.

764
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,700
Get back to work.

765
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,660
Go on.

766
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,900
Sir, they're ready!

767
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,780
Shoe shine!

768
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,740
Genuine American polish.
Get your shoes shined!

769
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,900
One mao a pair!

770
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,380
Sha.

771
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,940
What are you doing?

772
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,020
Let's go.

773
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,260
Are you out of your mind?

774
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,020
Starting today,

775
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,700
you'll be going to school here.

776
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,380
You'll eat and sleep here too.

777
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,660
I'll come visit whenever I'm off.

778
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,700
I don't want to go to school.

779
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,980
You might be a little older

780
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,340
than the other kids in your class.

781
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
But that's not a bad thing.

782
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,620
No one will dare bully you.

783
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,140
But

784
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,820
you can't bully anyone either, okay?

785
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,380
I told you, I'm not going to school.

786
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,700
You have to.

787
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,740
Why?

788
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,980
Because I never got to go.

789
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,020
I want to know what it feels like.

790
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,380
And

791
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,300
if Xuan were still alive,

792
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,500
she'd be in school too.

793
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,980
I'm not you.

794
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,820
And I'm not Xuan.

795
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,340
That's right.

796
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,060
You're Cheng Hui.

797
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,540
And that's why you have to go to school.

798
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,540
You can't spend your whole life
shining shoes on the street.

799
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,100
You can't live in poverty forever.

800
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,220
And you can't drift through life
without purpose.

801
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,340
Why are you so good to me?

802
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,020
Because I care for you.

803
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,540
I'll study hard.

804
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,100
I won't let you down.

805
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,780
Sha.

806
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:24,980
Miss Ni.

807
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,060
Here's the latest pricing.

808
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,900
It includes the new products
we're about to launch,

809
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,020
as well as price adjustments
for some older ones.

810
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,220
When does it take effect?

811
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,860
Today.

812
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,420
Can I get another copy?

813
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:37,980
Sure thing.

814
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,100
Thanks.

815
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,780
No problem.

816
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,860
We've got new products today,

817
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,980
and some older ones
are getting price updates too.

818
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,420
This sheet has the latest pricing.

819
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,580
Make sure to update everything
before we open.

820
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,100
Got it.

821
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,900
Here, let me help you.

822
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,060
Mengqi, come.

823
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,420
You're coming with me to move the stock.

824
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,580
Go ahead.

825
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,220
Let's go.

826
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,900
[Marketing Department. Storeroom]
A lot of new arrivals today.

827
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,540
Don't mess them up.

828
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,740
We won't.

829
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,540
Alright.

830
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,100
Let's go.

831
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,580
The price tags are all changed?

832
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,700
Yes, they're all done.

833
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,660
Then put the items

834
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,540
on the shelves.

835
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,260
OK.

836
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,060
It's fine.

837
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,060
