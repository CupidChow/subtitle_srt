Why?

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,260
A few days ago,
Chu Shaohua sent her friend

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,340
to threaten me

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,130

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,220
She gave me 4,000 silver dollars

54

from telling the truth in court.

you couldn't tell the truth

It's her.

114
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,460

Zhou Yan

116
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,540
is Chu Shaohua's sister-in-law,

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,490
which makes her a relative.

118
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,850
So by that reasoning,
none of her testimony

119
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,410

come with legal responsibility.

A week ago,

142
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,610
Chu Shaohua's friend, Wen Zhiqiu,

143
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,780
approached Chu Shaozhong,

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,020
gave him a large sum of money,

145
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,980
and asked him
to give favorable testimony

Chu Shaozhong, am I right?

151
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,420
Do you need your son to take the stand?

152
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,860
Shaohua arranged a severance payout.

153
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
This money should be enough

154
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,180
to start a small business
or buy some land back home.

155
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,580
I will tell

156
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,780
everything I saw in court,

157
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,660

158
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
No need.

159
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,300
Your Honor,

160
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,900
what do the defendant's
repeated attempts

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:24,940
to bribe witnesses reveal?

162
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,820
They point unmistakably to guilt,

163
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,340
and that

164
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,180
substantiates the charges
we've brought forward.

165
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,220
Therefore, the true murderer
of Mrs. Chen,

166
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,660
Chen Ershun, and Chen Xuan,

167
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,340

169
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,660

What nonsense are you talking about?

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,780
I killed Mrs. Chen, Chen Ershun,

172
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,700
and Xuan.

175
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,660
That night, I went to Huashun Apothecary

176
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,380
not to bid farewell to Shaohua,

177
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,580
but to confront her

178
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,580
about why the Chen family got

179
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,740
half of Huashun Apothecary's shares.

180
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,220
When I arrived,

181
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,100
I saw Mrs. Chen and Chen Ershun

182
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,340
arguing with Shaohua.

183
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,500
They were trying
to stop her from remarrying.

184
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
It suddenly occurred to me

185
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,380
that if I killed them all,

186
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,500
Huashun Apothecary would be mine alone.

187
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,740
Chu Shaozhong, you're lying.

188
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,500
It was clearly Chu Shaohua
who killed them.

189
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,740
I used the guillotine knife
from the house.

190
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,980
Chen Ershun was the first.

191
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,260
I took his life by slitting his throat.

192
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,300
I smothered Xuan.

193
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,060
I killed Mrs. Chen, too.

194
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,540
I don't remember how, exactly.

195
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,340
Too much time has gone by.

196
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,420
The details have faded.

197
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,020
It all matches.

198
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,460
Just as I was about to kill Shaohua,

199
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,140
bandits burst in,

200
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,340
so I fled.

201
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,900
When I got home,

202
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,420
I told Zhou Yan

203
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,660
that Shaohua had killed someone.

204
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,620
But the truth is,

205
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,860
I killed them all.

206
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,940
What? It was really him.

207
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,180
What exactly is going on?

208
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,540
Shaozhong,

209
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,700
why would you do this?

210
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
You've always been the one

211
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,780
carrying the weight.

212
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm useless.

213
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,460
I can't do anything right.

214
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,380
But if I take the blame now,

215
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,660
maybe I can finally help you,

216
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,100
even if it's just a little.

Don't cry.

I've

220
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,620
spent my whole life

221
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,940
weighing you down.

222
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,620
Just let me do something for you.

223

Shaozhong.

224
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,700
Don't worry.

225
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,420
With me and Mr. Lin here,

226
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,500
I promise we'll get you out.

[Wen's Pharmacy]

228
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,260
I locked the door myself.

229
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,900
I remember it

230
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,060
because at that moment,

231
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
the sedative hadn't taken effect yet.

232
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,300
According to Shaozhong's recollection,

233
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,100
when he arrived at Huashun Apothecary,

234
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,660
the lock was fine,

235
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,260
but the side door was open.

236
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Who in Huashun Apothecary

237
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,700
was related to Chen Ershun?

238
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,780
A clerk named Song Dawei

239
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,460
was Chen Ershun's cousin.

240
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,900
But he wasn't the one
on duty that night.

241
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,100
It was someone named Shuangxi.

242
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,940
But

243
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,340
when my mind started to fade,

244
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,980
I called for Shuangxi.

245
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,180
There was no reply.

246
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,900
When going through the case files,

247
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I came across the testimony

248
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,220
of Chen Ershun's wife, Song Ping.

249
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,340
Most of it was nonsense,

250
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,100
disorganized and incoherent.

251
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,420
But when the police asked her

252
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,740
why Chen Ershun

253
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,620
went to Huashun Apothecary

254
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,180
so late that night,

255
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,260
she was crystal clear.

256
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,380
Just three words.

257
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,500
"He deserved it."

258
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,140
She must have known something.

259
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,060
The police kept pushing her for answers,

260
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,700
but she broke down in tears.

261
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,140
Then she went completely silent.

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
One day,

266
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,060
I will get Chichun Apothecary back.

Ma'am, have some tea.

268
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,820
Seeing you feels like a dream.

269
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,300
I never thought

270
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,420
I'd get the chance in this life.

271
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,740
I came back

272
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,180
to ask about

273
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,780
some clerks who used to work
at Huashun Apothecary.

274
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,460
Please go ahead.

275
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,340
Do you remember someone named Shuangxi?

276
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
Where is he?

277
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,060

That night,

279

Song Dawei rushed over and told me

280
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,660
that my father was ill

281
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,300
and asked me to hurry home.

282
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,420
He said he would cover my night shift.

283
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,180
I was quite grateful to him then.

284
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,260
But when I got home,

285
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
my father was perfectly fine.

286
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,980
It turned out he was lying to me.

287
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,660
Later, I heard something had happened
at the apothecary.

288
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,820
Mrs. Song passed away years ago.

289
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,300

Where exactly?

I don't know. Some say Yunnan,

some say Henan,

295
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,740
and others say
he died out there somewhere

296
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,020
because he didn't even come back
when Mrs. Song passed away.

297
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,900
Everyone in our village says

298
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,700
their family must've done
something terrible

299
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,860
to deserve such retribution.

300
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,340
Even his daughter's marriage
brought disaster.

301
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,220
After her marriage, the Chen family
was wiped out by bandits.

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,380
I haven't had a proper meal.

316
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,140
When they drove you out,

317
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,980
why didn't you go back
to your own family?

318
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,900
I did.

319
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,820
My mother called me a jinx,

320
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,260
said I'd bring misfortune to my brother,

321
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,580
and wouldn't let me in.

322
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,620
What have you been living on
all these years?

323
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,780
At first, someone suggested

324
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,220
I remarry.

325
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,900
But I couldn't have children,

326
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,180
so no one wanted me.

327
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,060
I tried picking up odd jobs,

328
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,300
but I wasn't good at anything

329
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,540
and couldn't earn a thing.

330
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,460
So I started washing clothes

331
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,220
and I've been doing it ever since.

332
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,100
How much can you earn washing clothes?

333
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,020
Just enough to keep me going.

334
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,740
Eventually, I came across
a generous family

335
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,740
who offered me a side room to live in.

336
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,060
They didn't even charge me rent.

337
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,900
What are your plans for the future?

338
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,540
I just take each day as it comes.

339
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,780
Song Ping,

340
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,900
don't just eat the meat and veggies.

341
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,940
Here, have some soup.

342
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,700
That night,
when Huashun Apothecary burned down,

343
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,380
Ershun's mother came by
with a bowl of chicken soup.

344
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,020
But who made that soup, anyway?

345
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,980
The chicken soup?

346
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,180
I made it.

347
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,660
But I didn't put...

348
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,500
You didn't what?

349
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,340
I just didn't.

350
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,340
Song Ping, what are you trying to say?

351
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,060
I don't know anything.

352
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,620
So when the police asked,

353
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,100
why did you say
Chen Ershun deserved it?

354
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,780
I...

355
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
I said

356
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,020
I don't know anything.

357
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,940
You knew there was something wrong
with that soup?

358
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,860
I'm leaving.

359
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,460
Song Ping, you know why Chen Ershun

360
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,820
went to Huashun Apothecary, don't you?

don't you?

365
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,900
Don't ask me anymore.

366
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,740
Even if I knew the truth,

367
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,820
I couldn't tell you.

368
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,820
Why?

369
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,580
You're not like the rest of us.

370
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,540
You're strong.

371
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,460
You survived being captured by bandits,

372
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,820
and now you're living well.

373
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,220
But me?

374
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,420
I'm clumsy.

375
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,420
Just staying alive is hard enough.

376
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,060
So please,

377
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,260
I don't want to get involved
in your troubles.

378
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,220
Song Ping, take a seat.

379
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,260
Come on.

380
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,260
The truth

381
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,180
means a lot to me.

382
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
Chen Ershun's gone.

383
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,060
His mother, too.

384
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,620
Everyone's dead.

385
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,020
The slate's been wiped clean.

386
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,020
But my brother, Chu Shaozhong,
is still in prison.

387
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,180
If I can't find proof

388
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,540
of what really happened that night,

389
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,780
he'll end up taking the fall
for Chen Ershun's death.

390
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,540
Then find the evidence.

391
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,740
Leave me out of it.

392
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,460
I just want to wait for the end.

393
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,900
Song Ping, what are you worried about?

394
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,180
Do you have any idea
how hard my life has been

395
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,180
since the Chen family incident?

396
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,420
Everyone

397
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,540
pointed fingers at me,

398
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,380
calling me a jinx.

399
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,220
People threw stones at me
when I walked on the street.

400
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,220
Just when they've finally forgotten
about it,

401
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
you want to drag it all back up again.

402
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,420
What's going to happen to me
after you're gone?

403
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,460
How am I supposed to live?

404
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,740
I understand.

405
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,620
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,460
I won't push you anymore.

407
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,860
Just do whatever you feel is right.

408
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,500
Where

409
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,420
are you going?

410
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,780
There's someone

411
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,420
I need to see.

412
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,220
Xuan.

413
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,460
I've come to see you.

414
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,660
I brought you a gift.

415
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,460
Do you remember

416
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,500
many years ago,

417
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,060
Mr. Xia

418
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,300
drew you a picture book like this?

419
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,820
You loved it very much.

420
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
[In Memory of My Beloved Daughter, Xuan]

421
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,380
But later, that picture book

422
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
was burned in the fire.

423
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,980
Mr. Xia is gone.

424
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,340
I found

425
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,060
the original version
of the book in Shanghai,

426
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,220
so I bought it for you.

427
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,500
Take your time.

428
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,620
Xuan.

429
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,100
You like this picture book, don't you?

430
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,860
Song Ping.

431
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Come out.

432
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,820
I know you've been following me.

433
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,380
So Xuan is buried here.

434
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,220
Song Ping.

435
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,060
Can I ask you a favor?

436
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,780
Go ahead.

437
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,420
When I'm not around,

438
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,700
could you visit Xuan more often

439
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,780
and talk to her?

440
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,380
Here, the mountains and rivers
watch over her,

441
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,340
and the grass and flowers
keep her company,

442
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,260
but she was so young when she passed.

443
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,060
I'm afraid she'll feel lonely
all by herself.

444
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,940
I remember that back then, besides me,

445
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,100
you were the one Xuan loved most.

446
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,900
There were times

447
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,100
I'd smack her hand

448
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,300
for slacking off in her writing.

449
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,100
But you never laid a finger on her

450
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,500
and always snuck her little treats.

451
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,540
Yes.

452
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,020
You wouldn't let her eat sweets,

453
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,900
afraid it'd ruin her teeth.

454
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,100
So she'd come to me.

455
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,460
She knew

456
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,140
I'd never say no.

457
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,580
She loved being in my arms the most.

458
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,540
She always said

459
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,620
my embrace was the warmest
and safest place in the world.

460
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,900
Xuan always loved your cooking the most.

461
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,140
Honestly, mine wasn't as good as yours,

462
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,540
but she just happened to like it anyway.

463
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,340
What a pity.

464
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,500
Xuan will never get to
enjoy your cooking again.

465
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,140
Such a shame.

466
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,060
Song Ping,

467
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,780
do you know how Xuan died?

468
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,020
Chen Ershun smothered her

469
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,700
with the tiger pillow

470
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,220

Some even say

478
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,740
he died unfairly.

479
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,620

we didn't know each other before,

528

but we joined the family
on the same day.

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,180
We're practically sisters.

531

is mutual respect, love

532
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,180
and taking care of each other.

533
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,620

534
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,620

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,460

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,740
Xuan, come here.

00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,660
I'm coming for you.

538
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,900
I'm going to catch you.

539
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,180
Is Song Ping home?

540
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,700
What is it?

541
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,940
Hello, do you remember me?

542
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,660
I'm Wang, the former shopkeeper
of Huashun Apothecary.

543
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,620
I've opened my own apothecary.

544
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,860
It's called Yixin Apothecary.

545
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,740
It's on East Street.

546
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
We could really use

547
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,700
an extra pair of hands at the shop.

548
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,260
Would you like to join us?

549
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,300
Me?

550
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,100
I'll pay you
twenty silver dollars a month.

551
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,060
If you're willing to learn a skill,

552
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,340
you could earn a higher wage.

553
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,980
But it's okay if you don't.

554
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,740
As long as my shop stays open,

555
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,300
you'll always have a place here.

556
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,180
I'm willing to work here.

557
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,380
Oh, right.

558
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,180
The Young Mistress asked me

559
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,340
to give you half a month's pay
in advance.

560
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,380
Please take this.

561
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Who is it?

562
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,380
Well,

563
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,700
I keep forgetting to fix my address.

564
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,020
It's Miss Chu Shaohua.

565
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,580
Shaohua?

566
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,900
Alright, I'll see you
at the shop tomorrow.

567
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,540
I'll take my leave.

568
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,900
Mrs. Zhang.

569
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,220
Mrs. Zhang.

570
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,380
Mrs. Zhang.

571
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,900
Mr. Zhang.

572
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,380
Song Ping, grabbed a bite yet?

573
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,100
You can join us.

574
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,220
Yes.

575
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,980
Mr. and Mrs. Zhang,

576
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,980
I've got some great news.

577
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,980
I just landed a new job.

578
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,500
It's at Yixin Apothecary,

579
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,820
over on East Street.

580
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,900
They're paying
20 silver dollars a month.

581
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,900
So from now on, I can afford the rent.

582
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,540
This is

583
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,500
this month's rent.

584
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,780
We can't take this.

585
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,620
You must take it.

586
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,380
All these years,

587
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,180
you never asked me for rent.

588
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,660
In my heart,

589
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,500
I've always felt...

590
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,220
I don't know how to put it into words,

591
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,700
but you know what I mean.

592
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,380
Now that I'm earning money,

593
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,540
if I still don't pay rent,

594
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,420
what kind of person would that make me?

595
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,700
Song Ping, the thing is,

596
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,300
all these years,

597
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,380
it's not that we didn't charge you rent,

598
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,020
but someone else
has been covering it for you

599
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,140
all this time.

600
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,820
Who?

601
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,500
We don't know

602
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,020
who it is either.

603
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,140
There's a Miss Chu in Shanghai.

604
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,260
Every six months,

605
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,260
she would send us

606
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,220
your rent.

607
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,380
Shaohua?

608
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,020
- Song Ping.
- Song Ping.

609
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,660
What's going on with her?

610
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,700
[Shanghai Public Court]

611
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,500
[Defendant]
Your Honor,

612
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,820
upon verification,

613
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,460
Chu Shaozhong's confession

614
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,780
matches the on-site investigation.

615
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,060
And he has admitted

616
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
the facts of the murder
without hesitation.

617
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,260
We respectfully urge the court
to impose a severe sentence

618
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,300
to restore public morality

619
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,940
and affirm the authority of the law.

620
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,620
The train was delayed.

621
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,580
Will we make it in time?

622
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,300
Yes.

623
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,140
Defendant, do you have
anything else to say?

624
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,180
Your Honor,

625
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,020
our key witnesses are en route.

626
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,060
We respectfully request
a brief extension.

627
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,980
Mr. Lin,

628
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,980
are you trying to stall?

629
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,660
The facts of this case
are already clear.

630
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,180
Delaying won't change anything.

631
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,780
Your Honor,

632
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,820
[Presiding Judge]
this case involves three lives.

633
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,700
We respectfully request you
to grant us some more time.

634
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,980
I'll give you ten minutes.

635
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,380
If the witnesses have still not arrived,

636
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,540
we will proceed with sentencing.

637
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,980
Zhiqiu, can you go any faster?

638
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,420
Hold tight.

639
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,900
Time's up. Defendant,

640
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,740
have the witnesses arrived?

641
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,820
Your Honor,

642
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,580
they should be here any moment.

643
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,020
I won't wait any longer.

644
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,820
Next, I announce...

645
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,140
Wait a moment.

646
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,420
Your Honor,

647
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,260
we request

648
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,500
to summon our witness, Chu Shaohua,
to testify in court.

649
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,100
Summon witness Chu Shaohua
to appear in court.

650
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,220
Chu Shaohua,

651
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,340
were you present at the scene

652
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,180
on the night of the incident?

653
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,460
I was.

654
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,940
Did you witness

655
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,460
Chu Shaozhong commit the murder?

656
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,820
Your Honor,

657
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,700
he never killed anyone.

658
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,300
I was the one who killed Chen Ershun.

659
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,220
Shaohua!

660
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,380
Order!

661
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,060
Chu Shaohua,

662
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,340
why did you have to kill Chen Ershun?

663
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,060
Back then,

664
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,060
Chen Ershun conspired with his mother

665
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,140
to have her bring me chicken soup
at the apothecary.

666
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,340
There was a sedative in the soup.

667
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,500
That night, I sensed something was off,

668
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,340
but I never imagined

669
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,380
they'd also laced

670
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,860
my teapot.

671
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,300
After drinking the tea,

672
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,740
I gradually lost the strength to resist.

673
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
Later, I found out

674
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,540
that Chen Ershun
had arranged for someone

675
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,580
to damage the apothecary's door
that day.

676
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,740
Then he broke into my room.

677
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,260
And he...

678
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,540
raped me.

679
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
And he used a pillow...

680
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,460
to smother my only child, Chen Xuan.

681
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,700
After that, I started

682
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,020
to regain consciousness.

683
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,380
Devastated by the loss of my daughter,

684
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,020
I used the paper cutter
from the apothecary...

685
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,460
to kill Chen Ershun.

686
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
Not long after...

687
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,740
his mother arrived.

688
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,060
And then,

689
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,980
the bandits also came.

690
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,740
And you know...

691
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,020
what happened after that.

692
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,860
[Plaintiff]
Chen Ershun

693
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,220
is so utterly depraved.

694
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,860
Why would he do that?

695
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,860
Ever since my husband,

696
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,660
Chen Dashun,

697
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,420
and my father-in-law passed away,

698
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,500
I've been the sole support

699
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,420
of the Chen family.

700
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,740
Before the incident,

701
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,020
I met someone I truly loved.

702
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,100
My plan was to marry him
and take my daughter, Chen Xuan,

703
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,900
to France so we could start a new life.

704
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,140
When Mrs. Chen found out about this,

705
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
she was unwilling

706
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,260
to lose me, her golden goose,

707
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,860
or her granddaughter, Chen Xuan.

708
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Chen Ershun

709
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
made repeated advances

710
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,380
toward me,

711
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,860
even when my husband was still alive.

712
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,580
So at that time, they conspired...

713
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,940
to use the idea
of levirate marriage to trap me.

714
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,860
Chu Shaohua.

715
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,180
Are all the facts you have stated above

716
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,860
supported by witnesses or evidence?

717
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,660
Everything I said is true.

718
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,260
And I have a witness.

719
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,700
Her name is Song Ping.

720
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,860

from their discussion and planning

724
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,420
to the moment they gave me the sedative.
