Both making money and getting promoted.

572
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,180
If I wear this out,

573
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
it'll blind everyone with its shine.

574
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,380
Heavens!

575
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,900
I love you so much, Mu.

576
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,020
If you love me, marry me.

577
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,260
Are you proposing to me?

578
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:28,980
Look.

579
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,540
We've been together for years.

580
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,660
I should start a family at my age.

581
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,700
Plus, my master will switch professions.

582
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,660
I won't deal with violence anymore.

583
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,260
I just want a peaceful life with you.

584
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,100
Will you marry me?

585
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,820
Shaohua.

586
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,580
Look.

587
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,180
What are you doing?

588
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,660
Ms. Chu,

589
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,620
what do you mean by this?

590
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,020
You killed Xia Chu.

591
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,540
What are you talking about?

592
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,220
Drop the act, Mr. Mu.

593
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,060
Who started the rumor?

594
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,340
Shaohua,

595
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,500
are you sure?

596
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,020
Fine. Then tell me.

597
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,580
How did you get promoted

598
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,260
and get that large bonus?

599
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,420
Who told you?

600
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,100
If you don't want anyone to know,

601
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,700
better not do it at all.

602
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,780
Don't shoot!

603
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,060
Misunderstanding!

604
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,300
Xia Chu is dead!

605
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,580
The gun went off accidentally.

606
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,540
I swear,

607
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,220
I didn't mean to fire the gun.

608
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,500
He has five bullet holes in him.

609
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,540
All from stray bullets?

610
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,820
It was chaotic back then.

611
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,300
When shots rang out,
everyone started firing.

612
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,220
It was impossible to tell who was who.

613
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,500
It really was you?

614
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,660
I was carrying out an operation.

615
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,820
I swear, he wasn't my target.

616
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,820
Besides,

617
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,940
He wasn't on the list.

618
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,420
He suddenly showed up there.

619
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,700
But you shot.

620
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,980
Someone was shouting

621
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,740
that someone resisted arrest.

622
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,700
I just shot before thinking.

623
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,900
I didn't know that person was Xia Chu.

624
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,900
Three shots in a row!

625
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,660
He was on the ground,

626
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,060
yet you added two more bullets.

627
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,580
You did kill him?

628
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,340
Shaohua,

629
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,740
I was out of my mind.

630
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,780
I had no idea what I did.

631
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,020
I regret it deeply now.

632
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,980
Regret?

633
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,420
Mr. Mu,

634
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,180
you said at the victory banquet

635
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,780
that if you had known
killing communists paid so well,

636
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,740
you'd have killed several more.

637
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,340
I know

638
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,700
it won't help to say anything now.

639
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,580
For the sake of your bond with Erniu,

640
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,140
give me a chance to atone.

641
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,500
You can set any conditions.

642
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,340
I will absolutely do

643
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,820
whatever I can.

644
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,100
Don't drag us into this.

645
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,540
If you want to negotiate terms,

646
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,860
go talk to Xia Chu.

647
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,580
If he forgives you,

648
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,580
I have no objection.

649
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,220
No!

650
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,900
Erniu, step aside!

651
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,460
No, don't shoot!

652
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,180
Step aside!

653
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,780
Xia Chu is dead.

654
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,580
I must avenge him!

655
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,420
I know,

656
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,140
but I'm begging you.

657
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,700
Don't shoot!

658
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,100
Go!

659
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,580
Put down the gun!

660
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,700
She nearly killed me.

661
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,340
Put down the gun!

662
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,100
Get out!

663
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,340
Mu Ziru,

664
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,060
if you dare shoot,

665
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,300
I promise you'll never see me again

666
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,580
as long as you live.

667
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,300
You…

668
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,260
Erniu.

669
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,780
Everyone's here?

670
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,340
Wen Zhiqiu.

671
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,100
Mu,

672
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,700
let me tell you straight.

673
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,860
It's utterly unchivalrous

674
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,620
by pointing a gun at a woman.

675
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,340
Don't move!

676
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,420
Mr. Mu.

677
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,900
And you, Erniu.

678
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,460
Guns aren't toys.

679
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,460
Put it down.

680
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,900
None of your business. Leave now.

681
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,780
But we agreed to watch a film together.

682
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,620
Do you think

683
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,580
you can come and go whenever you please?

684
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,900
Fine.

685
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,860
Then nobody is leaving.

686
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,820
You may go,

687
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,420
but she stays.

688
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,540
That won't do.

689
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,300
I bought two tickets.

690
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,660
If she won't come with me,

691
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,620
will you watch it with me?

692
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,100
Come on, darling.

693
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,260
Let's go watch a movie.

694
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,500
Go!

695
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,460
Go.

696
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,700
- Chase.
- Come back!

697
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
Shaohua and I

698
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,100
are soul sisters forged in the fires
of growing up together.

699
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,340
For a man like you…

700
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,680
[Jiangyue Hall]

701
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,660
I know you treat me well.

702
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,820
I'll repay you double someday.

703
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,060
Mu Ziru,

704
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,180
there's no future for us.

705
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,420
What do you mean?

706
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,900
I saved your life today.

707
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
Let's call it square

708
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,420
after all these years of your kindness.

709
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,540
From now on,

710
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,620
we go our separate ways.

711
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,620
Why?

712
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,260
You killed Xia Chu.

713
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,100
If I stay with you,

714
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,980
it's a betrayal to Shaohua.

715
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,900
Can't believe you'd dump me

716
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,980
for some random guy!

717
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,820
You don't know

718
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,860
what Xia Chu meant to Shaohua.

719
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,900
From now on,

720
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,780
you must never go to her,

721
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,380
let alone hurting her.

722
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,740
Even if I leave her untouched,

723
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,020
she won't spare me.

724
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,860
Better pray for yourself.

725
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,380
Give me back my gun.

726
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,060
How did you know I took it?

727
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,260
Only you

728
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,500
have a key to my house

729
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,060
and know where I hide it.

730
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,220
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Come on. What were you thinking?

732
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,860
Didn't let me perish
alongside Wang Guodong.

733
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,500
Yet you came to Mu Ziru

734
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,580
to drag him down with you?

735
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,740
Are you crazy?

736
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,700
I just wanted to avenge Xia Chu.

737
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,740
By using a stupid method?

738
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,300
Where's your shrewdness?

739
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,940
Your judgment?

740
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,100
You called yourself strategic.

741
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,170
