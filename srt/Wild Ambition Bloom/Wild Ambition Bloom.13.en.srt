194
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,940
Knock it off.

195
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,900
I'll go, alright?

196
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,060
Don't bully my mother!

197
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,420
Xuan, let go.

198
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm your uncle!

199
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,100
Take your hands off.

200
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,540
Let go!

201
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,380
Hush. Don't make a sound.

202
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,220
Xuan!

203
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,460
Get off her!

204
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,700
Let go of her!

205
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,260
Stop crying!

206
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,020
Xuan!

207
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,580
Cut it out!

208
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,260
Stop!

209
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,700
Let her go!

210
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,820

Let go of her!

212
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,180

221
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,940
Let go of her!

222
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,340
Drop her!

223
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,420
Mother, you won't have to stress

224
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,940
over Chen Ershun not sending money back.

225
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,260
I'll be the one supporting us.

226
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,180
As long as

227
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,620
Xuan and I get a share,

228
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,820
you will too.

229
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,540
You know what Ershun is like.

230
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,060
You must not be swayed by his words.

231
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,540
Mother.

232
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,020
Mother.

233
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,580
When did you get here?

234
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,100
I've been in here for a while.

235
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I kept calling out,
but you didn't respond.

236
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,100
I was starting
to think something was wrong.

237
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,500
You really scared me.

238
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,700
You scared the life out of me!

239
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,820
What's wrong with you?

240
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,100
What are you

241
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,340
doing here

242
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,220
in the middle of the night?

243
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,060
It's so late,

244
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,620
and Ershun's still not home.

245
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
I just came to see

246
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,780
if something had happened to him.

247
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,380
You have the gall to ask me?

248
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,860

250

You can't even keep
your own man in line.

251
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,580
And you have the nerve to ask me?

252
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,620
All you ever do is eat and sleep.

253
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,820
You're completely useless.

255
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,060
could have just given our family

256
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,260

257
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:44,940
do you think

258
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,940
I would end up like this?

259
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,500
I...

260
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,980
I'm...

261
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,500
You're burning up.

385
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,260
Shaohua

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,420
killed...

387
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,140
Killed what?

388
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,820
It's raining!

389
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,060
It's raining!

390
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,580
Quick,

391
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,340

Sir.

400
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,460
We need to get an answer,
whether she's alive or not.

401
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,340
Where is our young mistress?

402
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,820
Do you even have to ask?

403
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,500
She was kidnapped by the Sanshou Gang.

404
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,700
That's how they always operate.

405
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,060
They kill the men, abduct the women,

406
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,020
and then burn everything to the ground.

407
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,300
Sir,

408
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,220
what can we possibly do

409
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,580
to save her?

410
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,980
Women kidnapped by the Sanshou Gang

411
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,700
never come back alive.

412
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,940
What's the situation
with the Huashun Apothecary?

413
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,620
It's all burned to the ground.

414
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,620
What a pity.

415
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,300
What about that widow?

416
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,060
I heard they found three bodies
in the shop,

417
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,660
but none of them was hers.

418
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,780
They say she was captured
by the bandits.

419
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,860
She's not going to make it.

420
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,700
Her beauty was her curse.

421
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,460
Mr. Xia.

422
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,140
- Mr. Xia.
- Mr. Xia.

423
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,380
How much money do you have?

424
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,900
Well...

425
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,020
The money from the Chichun Apothecary
and our own shop,

426
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,300
combined,

427
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,620
is about 3,000 or so.

428
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,460
Give it all to me.

429
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,900
Mr. Xia,

430
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,500
what do you need so much money for?

431
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,420
I'm going

432
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,660
to the Sanshou Gang

433
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,300
to ransom Shaohua.

434
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,580
Shaohua?

435
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,740
You mean the widow?

436
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,580
Do you have anything with her?

437
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,980
Hurry, give me the money!

438
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,380
Mr. Xia,

439
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,780
you can't be so impatient.

440
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,420
I can't make a decision

441
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,700
about this much money by myself.

442
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,340
I will explain it to my brother.

443
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,180
You won't have to take the blame.

444
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,620
It's not that.

445
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,020
I'm not worried about the consequences.

446
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,420
It's just about the 3,000 silver dollars.

447
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,900
A lot of it is tied up in accounts.

448
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,100
It can't be collected on short notice.

449
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,060
Then go borrow it.

450
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,700
The Qizhou Trade Guild
has a lot of apothecary shops.

451
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,180
You must help me
raise 3000 silver dollars

452
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,540
within four hours.

453
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,620
No, make that 5000.

454
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,180
Alright, I'll help you raise it.

455
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,660
Mr. Xia,

456
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,940
there's something I need to tell you.

457
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,660
We have to find someone

458
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,780
to tell the Sanshou Gang

459
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,660
that we're raising the money

460
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,060
and let them show her mercy.

461
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,100
Our first priority
is to keep her safe, isn't it?

462
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,220
So you can get in touch with them?

463
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,500
Mr. Xia,

464
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,260
you see,

465
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
every single business

466
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,620
with a name in our town,

467
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,260
from apothecaries to dealers,

468
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,020
has to pay them a protection fee.

469
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,460
Not for any other reason,

470
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,100
just to make sure our goods

471
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,300
are safe.

472
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,020
Take me to them, now.

473
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,860
Mr. Xia, take a seat.

474
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,140
Please.

475
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,300
Please listen to me.

476
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,140
The messenger is an old lady,

477
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,580
and she's very sly.

478
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,860
She only contacts people she knows

479
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,300
or has designated.

480
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,540
She will not meet with any new faces,

481
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,980
so if you go, you're sure
to mess things up.

482
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,980
Then hurry

483
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,780
and get her to send a message to them.

484
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,340
Tell them money is not a problem.

485
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,060
We'll pay whatever it takes,

486
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,020
as long as Shaohua is safe.

487
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,940
I'll make sure

488
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,340
you get the money, alright?

489
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,060
Hurry up!

490
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,300
Don't worry.

491
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,140
You guys,

492
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,420

They say bandits came last night

527

She's probably not going to make it.

all the money to Shaozhong,

540
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,780
none of this
would have happened, would it?

541
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,060
Seriously!

542
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,420
Now the bandits got it all for nothing.

543
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,740

544
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,300

545
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
run.

546
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,180
Shaozhong

547
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,820
Shaohua, run.

548
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,700
Shaozhong.

549
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,060
- My poor son!
- Shaohua.

550
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,900
Mother, how's Shaozhong?

551
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,540
Run.

553
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,700
Hurry.

554
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,900
I just gave him a pot of medicine.

555
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,540
His fever isn't as bad as last night.

556
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,140
But he keeps saying

557
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,940
"There's been a murder."

558
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,860
He's talking nonsense.

559
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,660
My poor son.

560
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,500
Shaozhong.

561
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,140
Mother,

562
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,860
what he's saying might be true.

563
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,420
What did you say?

564
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,420
Mr. Xia.

565
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,380
The Sanshou Gang has replied.

Xuan.

00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,060
Don't be scared, my love.

569
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,380
Mother's here.

570
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,780
I'll be with you.

571
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,500
Upon investigation,

572
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,700
the Chen family currently owns
several plots of farmland,

573
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,260
an old residence,

574
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,820
and a few miscellaneous items.

575
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,620
Sir.

576
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,100
Sir.

577
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,740
What?

578
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,540
It's time for you to speak.

579
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,820
Ping.

580
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,180
By our ancestors' rules,

581
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
this property belongs
to the Chen family

582
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,060
and can't be given to anyone
from another family name.

583
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,300
Am I right?

584
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,820
Yes.

585
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,580
You are

586
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,460
indeed reasonable.

587
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,060
Exactly.

588
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,020
You're reasonable.

589
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,940
Since that's the case,

590
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,500
each branch should divide it
according to the number of people.

591
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,060
That's right.

592
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,500
Let's divide it.

593
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,340
OK.

594
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,020
Let's divide it.

595
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,740
Third Elder.

596
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,260
What about me?

597
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,900
Just go back to your family's home.

598
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,180
If you choose to remarry later,

599
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,260
we will not object at all.

600
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,300
But

601
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,260
what about the fields and houses?

602
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,900
You haven't had any children,

603
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,420
and you're not a Chen.

604
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,700
What business is any of that of yours?

605
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,180
But...

606
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,700
But...

607
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,500
You just agreed to that.

608
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,020
But I'm also a member
of the Chen family!

609
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,380
Third Elder, please stand up for me.

610
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,940
Someone,

611
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,300
give Ping,

612
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,980
no,

613
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,060
Song's things to her

614
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,260
and let her go.

615
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,500
Here.

616
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,580
I've packed everything for you.

617
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,220
Before it gets completely dark,

618
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,620
hurry back to Songjiazhuang.

619
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,780
Here.

620
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,860
I'm not going back.

621
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,660
I...

622
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,740
Third Elder, I'm begging you.

623
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,260
Please let me stay!

624
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,060
My family won't

625
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,380
take me back like this.

626
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,180
I have nowhere to go now.

627
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,220
-  I can't go back.
- Just go.

628
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,860
- Third Elder.
- Get out of here.

629
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,180
Uncle!

630
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,580
Uncle, I'm begging you!

631
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,700
Please, say something for me!

632
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,260
Let me stay!

633
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,380
I'm begging you!

634
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,140
- Go.
- I beg of you!

635
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,140
Don't shut the door!

636
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,980
Open the door!

637
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,300
I'm begging you!

638
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,380
Please!

639
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,740
Please let me stay!

640
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
Third Elder!

641
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,340
Third Elder!

642
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,500
A servant just reported

643
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,180
Chen Xuan's grave has been dug up.

644
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Her body is missing.

645
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,900
Only a straw mat was left behind.

646
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,460
Wild dogs, no doubt.

647
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,540
I warned you it was too shallow.

648
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,420
But you insisted it was enough.

649
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,740
Come on, everyone,
put your handprints on it!

650
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,620
Alright.

651
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Mrs. Chen Junior had quite a temper.

652
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,940
On the way after being abducted
by the Sanshou Gang,

653
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,020
she jumped off a cliff.

654
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,260
Was it from here?

655
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,380
It seems to be right here.
