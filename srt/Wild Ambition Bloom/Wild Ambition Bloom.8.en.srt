00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,460
I've made
this anti-nausea sachet for you.

191
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,650
Young Mistress.

192
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,420
Several matters to report to you.

193
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,980
Shitou,

194
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,100
what are they?

195
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,980
Second Young Master has visited
the apothecary multiple times.

196
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,850
What did he go there for?

197
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,700
I don't know.

198
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,580
He was asking about its current assets

199
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,580
and available cash reserves.

200
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,850
Also, the holder of the ledger

201
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,770
and customer list.

202
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,890
Just wait a moment.

203
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,700
Okay.

204
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,010
Keep this safe.

205
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,130
Both the ledger and the customer list

206
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,220
are here.

207
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,730
Don't give this

208
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,460
to anyone except me.

209
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,420
Okay.

210
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,060
Leave now!

211
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,770
Yeah.

212
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,220
Song Ping.

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,770
Song Ping.

214
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,250
Shaohua.

215
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,730
Could you keep an eye on Xuan?

216
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,460
- Okay.
- I'm heading out.

217
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,940
Where are you going?

218
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,770
To the apothecary to do something.

219
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,460
Ma'am,

220
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,250
Ershun asks for you.

221
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,180
I'm off to take care of something

222
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
and will go to him as I get back.

223
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,380
He wants you to come over right now.

224
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,220
Second Young Mistress,
would you kindly join us?

225
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,900
Me?

226
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,420
Yes.

227
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,340
Mother.

228
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,620
Third Elder.

229
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,300
Third Elder.

230
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,980
Third Elder, everyone has arrived.

231
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,620
Congratulations?

232
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,540
To whom?

233
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,940
You may speak now, sir.

234
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,460
The funeral of Xiankui and Dashun

235
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,980
has been largely completed.

236
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,500
As the old saying goes,

237
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,940
a nation cannot remain leaderless
for even a single day.

238
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,100
A household cannot remain
without a head for even a single day.

239
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,380
Well,

240
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,820
this…

241
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,780
Per the ancestral rules
of the Chen family,

242
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,500
Ershun shall

243
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,420
be the head of the household.

244
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,620
Ershun shall handle all things.

245
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,620
Xiankui's wife.

246
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,020
Xiankui's wife?

247
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm here, sir.

248
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,620
Madam,

249
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,540
do you approve

250
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,780
of what Third Elder just said?

251
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,220
Yes.

252
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,180
She agreed.

253
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,700
In this case,

254
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,660
this matter is settled.

255
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,700
I disagree.

256
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,780
You're Dashun's wife.

257
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,340
You have no say here.

258
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,020
Although Dashun is gone,

259
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,260
he retained half a claim
to this household.

260
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
Since you acknowledge me as his wife,

261
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,420
I shall represent him

262
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,300
and thus preside over half
of this household.

263
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,420
How do you, a woman,

264
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,820
run a household?

265
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,860
While Father was alive,

266
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,500
I held influence at the main store

267
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
and likewise oversaw the branch.

268
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,340
Tell me why I can't run this household.

269
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,340
It would be a different story

270
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,180
if there were no men in this family.

271
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,060
Yet Ershun is in this household.

272
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,740
It's only natural

273
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,860
to let him be in charge.

274
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,060
Shaohua,

275
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,260
once I take charge of this household,

276
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,780
I promise to treat you and Xuan well.

277
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,900
You can rest assured.

278
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
Even Ershun has stated his position.

279
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,180
What else do you want?

280
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,460
He may take charge.

281
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,180
But when Father was alive,

282
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,780
he explicitly agreed

283
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,700
Dashun and I shall manage the branch,

284
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,540
with half of its shares allocated to us.

285
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,060
Since Dashun is no longer here,

286
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,420
that half of the shares

287
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,820
rightfully belongs to me and Xuan.

288
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,140
Therefore, I think I should

289
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,020
manage the branch.

290
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
I didn't know about that.

291
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,660
What on earth

292
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,860
are you quarreling about?

293
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,220
Mother,

294
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,740
you were present
when Father made this decision.

295
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,500
Tell them

296
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,180
if what I said is entirely true.

297
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,220
I have no idea.

298
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,340
How

299
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,020
should I have known?

300
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,940
You have no idea about this?

301
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,300
As a woman,

302
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,780
I don't know anything

303
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
about business matters.

304
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,860
I don't recall them saying that.

305
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,500
Mother!

306
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,820
Father and Dashun's seventh-day memorial
hasn't even passed yet.

307
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,020
Don't speak without conscience.

308
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,900
They won't rest in peace.

309
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,540
How dare you speak to Mother like that?

310
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,380
Mother,

311
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,780
the business

312
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,140
is no minor affair.

313
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,460
You know what Ershun is like best.

314
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,260
You mustn't be bewitched by his words!

315
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,420
What's wrong with me?

316
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,100
Ever since you married
into our Chen family,

317
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,460
relying on Dashun's favoritism,

318
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,380
you've been opposing Mother
at every turn.

319
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,980
She's only tolerated you
and yielded ground

320
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,260
out of deference to Dashun.

321
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,140
Of course, I admit I wasn't sensible.

322
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,580
But overnight, I've truly grown up.

323
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,940
Listen carefully, starting today,

324
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,260
I will no longer tolerate
your unchecked arrogance!

325
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,740
Mother,

326
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,820
be honest now.

327
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,340
Did Father promise to let

328
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,300
Dashun and me manage the branch,

329
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,100
with 50% of shares allocated to us?

330
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,620
There is no such thing.

331
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,500
Song Ping,

332
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
you were there as well.

333
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,260
Tell everyone

334
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,460
what Father said.

335
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,580
I…

336
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,300
Say whatever you heard.

337
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,900
That day, Father did…

338
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,860
Did what?

339
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,260
I dare you!

340
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,100
Song Ping,

341
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,740
go ahead.

342
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,260
Spill it.

343
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,380
I don't remember.

344
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,460
Song Ping.

345
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,060
Song Ping.

346
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,980
Please don't make me do this.

347
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,660
Tell them.

348
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,180
I heard nothing.

349
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,580
I heard absolutely nothing.

350
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,700
Seems that everything is quite clear.

351
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,260
Shaohua,

352
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,500
let the past be past.

353
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,060
Mother and I won't hold it against you.

354
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,980
From now on,

355
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,500
live a quiet life

356
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,940
and stop stirring up trouble.

357
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,820
Chen Ershun!

358
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,660
Don't think by using Mother
and scaring Song Ping,

359
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,700
you can cover up everything.

360
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,140
Don't forget

361
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,140
Father and Dashun's business partners

362
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,500
and all the clerks and hired hands
at the stores.

363
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,140
They all know perfectly well

364
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,060
what's really going on here.

365
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm going to them right now

366
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,500
to let them see your true colors.

367
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,260
Stop her.

368
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,140
Get out of the way.

369
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,220
Listen,

370
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,940
as a married woman,

371
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,300
you're eccentric, defiant,

372
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,340
disobedient, and unfilial.

373
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,860
You're going too far.

374
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,540
Shut your mouth!

375
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,700
This is our family business.

376
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,180
Stay out of it!

377
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,020
Third Elder, please say something!

378
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,620
You're

379
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,620
going too far!

380
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,740
And you!

381
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,700
You are confused

382
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,140
and easily manipulated!

383
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,100
You don't deserve
to be the clan's leader!

384
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,900
- Sir, this…
- You don't!

385
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,900
- Drag her out.
- You don't deserve it!

386
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,340
You don't deserve it. Let go!

387
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,220
Let go!

388
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,700
Lock her in the woodshed!

389
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,980
- Let me go now.
- Starve her for a few days

390
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,980
and see if she still shows
no respect to her elders!

391
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,300
Song Ping.

392
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,540
Where's Xuan? Is she doing well?

393
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,620
She's doing great.

394
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,660
I've been taking care of her.
Don't worry.

395
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,140
Come here.

396
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,700
I brought you something to eat.

397
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,300
Song Ping,

398
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,460
help me untie this.

399
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:33,900
I dare not.

400
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,100
Ershun said

401
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,700
he'll kill anyone

402
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,780
who sets you free.

403
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,300
Don't fear him.

404
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,060
I do.

405
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,700
He said

406
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
so long as you turn over

407
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,860
the ledger and the list,

408
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,700
he'll set you free.

409
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,420
Shaohua,

410
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
just yield to him.

411
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,060
You won't stand a chance against him.

412
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,620
His strikes really hurt!

413
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm not afraid of pain.

414
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,820
Just let him take over.

415
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,900
Let me tell you this.

416
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,260
Since Ershun returned,

417
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,620
Mother's been generous with money.

418
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,980
We have meat at every meal.

419
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,620
Is that enough?

420
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,100
What more do you want?

421
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,500
All I want is fairness!

422
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,780
Song Ping,

423
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,180
help me!

424
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,060
Let me out secretly.

425
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,940
Without telling others.

426
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,940
Song Ping,

427
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,300
you know perfectly well

428
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,420
that everything Chen Ershun said
was a lie,

429
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,460
and what I said is the truth.

430
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,580
I'm leaving.

431
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,980
Song Ping!

432
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,620
Song Ping!

433
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,380
Shaohua, don't be so stubborn.

434
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,940
Life goes on either way.

435
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,300
Song Ping!

436
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,460
Shaohua hasn't loosened her lips,

437
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,300
not even now.

438
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,700
Calm down.

439
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,660
It has only been two days.

440
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,540
Starve her for a few more,

441
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,260
and she'll beg to obey!

442
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,300
Ershun,

443
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,980
don't you think you were being
too harsh on her that day?

444
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,660
Too harsh, Mother?

445
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,020
If I hadn't crushed her underfoot,

446
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,100
with her temper,

447
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,780
she'd have stirred up chaos.
You believe me?

448
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,300
Yes, I do believe.

449
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,740
But lately, I…

450
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,460
Ershun, listen to me.

451
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
[In Memory of My Father, Chen Xiankui]
[In Memory of My Husband, Chen Dashun]

452
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,300
Ershun, listen to me.

453
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,180
When your father was alive,

454
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,860
he did say

455
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,860
half of the shares should go to Shaohua.

456
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,700
Here's my idea.

457
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,620
Since it's just half of the store,

458
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,500
give it to her and settle this.

459
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,100
Give it to her? You're
ridiculously generous.

460
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,940
Even if Father did say
to divide the shares,

461
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,740
they weren't meant for her,
but for Dashun.

462
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,180
As Dashun has passed away,

463
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,140
these shares should be returned to us.

464
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,300
I won't give it to her.

465
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,460
Frankly, Mother,

466
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,660
don't you fear she'll leave
with the shares

467
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,900
or hand them straight
to her birth family?

468
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,620
To her family...

469
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,940
She is Xuan's mother after all.

470
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,340
You're utterly confused.

471
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,740
When Xuan marries,
she'll belong to another family.

472
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,260
You know exactly Shaohua is scheming.

473
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,100
If we yield an inch now

474
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
and let her catch her breath,

475
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,180
she'll swallow us whole!

476
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,260
She has such a fiery temperament.

477
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,340
But as she is locked like this,

478
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,740
what if something happens?

479
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,180
I won't be at ease...

480
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,780
Mother,

481
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,380
why don't you go try to persuade her?

482
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,900
Ever since you married into the family,

483
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,380
I've always treated you
as my own daughter.

484
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,220
You're undeniably capable.

485
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,420
There's no doubt about that.

486
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,380
But you're being far too ambitious.

487
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,180
Dashun doted on you

488
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,340
and protected you.

489
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,500
But now that

490
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,740
he's gone,

491
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,540
no one in this family

492
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,740
will ever cherish

493
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,100
and protect you like he did.

494
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,700
Just because no one

495
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,220
will protect me and Xuan,

496
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,180
I absolutely refuse

497
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,140
to let you bully us as you like.

498
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,540
Ershun did go too far.

499
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,500
I scolded him.

500
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,260
But if only you had been obedient,

501
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,620
none of these would have happened.

502
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,780
All I sought was my rightful portion.

503
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,660
Was that truly so wrong?

504
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,900
Why cling to those things?

505
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,380
As a woman,

506
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,500
with sustenance secured at home,

507
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,060
you should manage domestic affairs

508
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,700
and nurture Xuan.

509
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,340
Isn't that great enough?

510
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,780
Mother.

511
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,100
Whether in Chen Village
or all across Peking,

512
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,420
go and ask anyone

513
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,300
if there is a woman behaving like you,

514
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,740
running around outside all day long.

515
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,380
Mother!

516
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,380
Now, only I can make money in our family

517
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,860
and be capable
of handling this business.

518
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,740
Why ever would you stop me?

519
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,300
Making money?

520
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,980
Hadn't you stubbornly pushed

521
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,980
for that military supply order,

522
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,140
your father and Dashun
wouldn't have died!

523
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,260
If I had known

524
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,380
there would be plague,

525
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,940
I'd have gone myself

526
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,740
instead of letting Dashun go!

527
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,180
Regret changes nothing at this point.

528
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,700
I advise you not to be stubborn anymore.

529
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,660
Undoubtedly,

530
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,100
Ershun will preside over this household.

531
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,660
This is the tradition
of our Chen family.

532
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,380
You will submit to it.

533
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,380
So will I.

534
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,780
Why didn't Father let Er Shun

535
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,540
get involved
with the apothecary business?

536
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,820
Why did he drive him back
to his hometown?

537
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,860
As his own mother,

538
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
you should know better than anyone else.

539
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,860
Do you truly believe
he can carry this family's burden?

540
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,740
That was the past.

541
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,220
Back then, both his father

542
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,180
and Dashun were there.

543
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,740
They stood tall and protected all of us.

544
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,180
Ershun was still young back then.

545
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,340
That's why he was insensible.

546
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,740
But now that they're both gone,

547
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,380
Ershun will change.

548
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,180
He's said it himself

549
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,140
that he'll carry this family
on his shoulders.

550
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
He also told me that,

551
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,100
from now on, he will serve you for life,

552
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,540
exactly the same way

553
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,380
as when Dashun was still here.

554
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
The same way?

555
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,140
Shaohua,

556
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,500
one last word of advice from me.

557
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,940
Don't fight with Ershun.

558
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,340
If you give my portion to me,

559
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,580
our Chen family can still survive.

560
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,780
But if you give everything
to Chen Ershun,

561
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,820
our family will truly be ruined.

562
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,860
I, I, I…

563
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,860
I can't talk sense into you.

564
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,340
Fine, I'll stop trying.

565
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,300
Just stay right here.

566
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,140
Mother,

567
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,140
take one last good look
at this house.

568
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,020
I'll say this plainly.

569
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,740
Before long,

570
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,020
none of us will belong here anymore.

571
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,380
How is it going, Mother?

572
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,460
She still won't listen to reason?

573
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,980
How stubborn she is!

574
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,780
With her personality, let me tell you,

575
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,420
she'll never back down.

576
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,740
If you ask me, just let her go.

577
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,180
Can't do that.

578
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,980
Absolutely not.

579
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,500
If I set her free,

580
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,260
who knows what rumors
she'd spread about me?

581
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,580
Then how should I run my business

582
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,780
or even survive in Peking?

583
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,260
But it's not good in the long run

584
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,340
to keep her trapped like this.

585
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,140
Stop playing around!

586
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,860
Why are you crying?

587
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,180
Alright, Xuan, don't cry.

588
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,340
Grandma.

589
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,260
Good girl, hush.

590
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,540
Grandma.

591
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,700
Hush.

592
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,180
Grandma.

593
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,340
Shh. Don't cry.

594
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,700
Grandma.

595
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,460
I've got a plan now!

596
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,180
Mother.

597
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,140
Xuan.

598
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,260
What's wrong, Xuan?

599
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,580
Nothing much.

600
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,860
She said she misses you.

601
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,780
So I brought her here to see you.

602
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,220
Go to your mother.

603
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,780
Mother.

604
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,700
Xuan, hush.

605
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,620
I'm here. Nothing to fear.

606
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,900
Your hair is dirty.

607
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,820
Don't touch me!

608
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,260
Xuan, be brave.

609
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,900
Shaohua,

610
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,620
I noticed something that day.

611
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,700
You look stern when you're angry,

612
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,620
but so beautiful when you smile.

613
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,260
Chen Ershun,

614
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,060
talking to me like that,

615
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,700
aren't you afraid at night,

616
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,260
Dashun would come to you?

617
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,540
Fine.

618
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,980
Then let's get down to business.

619
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,980
You heard what Third Elder said
that day.

620
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,060
Now, I am

621
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,540
the head of this household.

622
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,020
You have no choice

623
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,020
but to accept it.

624
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,860
Accept it or not?

625
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,980
Never!

626
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,700
Accept it or not?

627
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,820
Mother!

628
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,900
Never!

629
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,220
Believe it or not,
I'll ask someone to sell you off!

630
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,140
You dare?

631
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,500
See if I dare!

632
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,820
Don't push me into this.

633
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,300
Fine then.

634
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,060
A woman who had a child

635
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,140
wouldn't fetch much anyway.

636
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,820
Then I'll sell the little one instead.

637
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,220
Chen Ershun,

638
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,660
you are such a scumbag!

639
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,460
I'm going to a human trafficker.

640
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,620
I'll kill you!

641
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,220
Chu Shaohua!

642
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,740
Xuan!

643
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,420
Which matters more,

644
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,300
the apothecary or Xuan?

645
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,780
Mother!

646
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,900
As a businesswoman,

647
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,500
surely you can do
this simple calculation.

648
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,260
Release Xuan!

649
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,780
Mother!

650
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,020
Release her!

651
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,260
Alright, Xuan.

652
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,260
Let's go buy Tanghulu on the street.

653
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,140
Chen Ershun.

654
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,340
Mother!

655
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,500
Chen Ershun!

656
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,140
Mother!

657
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,260
I accept it!

658
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,660
Mother.

659
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,460
I accept it!

660
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,060
Release Xuan!

661
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,020
Please, I beg you. Release her!

662
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,700
I'll agree to anything!

663
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,780
I'll give you everything!

664
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,420
Please!

665
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,740
I'll do whatever you want!

666
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,940
Just release her!

667
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,620
Mother.

668
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,720
[Chen's Apothecary]

669
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,460
Second Young Master asked us here
early this morning.

670
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,660
What's the matter?

671
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,660
Who knows?

672
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,860
Whose orders should we follow now?

673
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,420
Young Mistress, of course!

674
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,180
When will she come?

675
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
At least after the seventh-day memorial.

676
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,340
And what about Second Young Master?

677
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,900
Ignore him.

678
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,260
How can we do that?

679
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,180
He's the boss, after all.

680
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,900
True.

681
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,300
Did he pay you?

682
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,460
No, you…

683
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,300
Second Young Master.

684
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,020
Sir.

685
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,380
Is everyone here?

686
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,140
Second Young Master,

687
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,260
all staff from both stores are here.

688
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,140
Someone wishes to address you all.

let's open it in Guangzhou.

back in our hometown.

for decades!

748
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,100
Well,

749
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,140
here's what I think.

750
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,740

weighing on your heart
till it festers into illness.

754
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,580
Going back there means
a change of environment.

755
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,580
Also, you can visit Auntie Song

756
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,660
and other relatives often,

757
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,460
so your spirits will lift.

758
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,820
I…

759
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,180
Mother,

760
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,980
as Father

761
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,860
and Dashun were gone suddenly,

762
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,900
I think it's too large
for us to live here.

763
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,060
With the ancestral home unoccupied,

764
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,180
isn't it rather a pity?

765
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,700
If you go back,

766
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,660
I'll surrender this house

767
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,020
and move to the backyard
of the apothecary.

768
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,460
I've calculated.

769
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,700
We'd save

770
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,420
over 100 silver dollars annually.

771
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,460
How much?

772
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,060
Over 100!

773
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,180
Even more than that!

774
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,220
Here in Peking,

775
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,540
one month's expenses

776
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,300
could fund an entire year back home.

777
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,900
If you four go back home,

778
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,620
how much would you save?

779
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,380
That's no small sum!

780
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,060
Exactly.

781
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,020
Mother,

782
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,700
the most critical thing is

783
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,220
Shaohua is a young widow.

784
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,860
Even if she intends
to preserve her chastity,

785
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,940
as every corner of Peking teems
with scoundrels,

786
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,380
how could she possibly do that?

787
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,940
Should anything happen to her,

788
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,780
how am I supposed to face Dashun?

789
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,020
This would shame our entire Chen family!

790
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,220
Ma'am,

791
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,580
where to place the firewood?

792
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,140
Put it inside.

793
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,220
Got it!

794
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,020
Here.

795
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,060
Put it inside.

796
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,980
Inside, yes.

797
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,780
Got it!

798
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,260
Just put it in here.

799
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,500
Then we'll go.

800
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,100
Fine.

801
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,220
You have the final say.

802
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,700
Mother,

803
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,740
why don't you let me stay in Peking?

804
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,420
You have no use here.

805
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,620
I'm getting on in years,

806
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,140
and you have to take care of me.

807
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,260
Mother, where are we now?

808
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,420
Almost home!

809
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,420
Oh my sister!

810
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,340
My brother-in-law!

811
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,900
Mother.

812
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,260
What brings you here?

813
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,100
Sister!

814
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,740
Dashun!

815
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,900
Dashun!

816
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,740
My brother-in-law!

817
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,300
Mother.

818
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,940
Mrs. Chen,

819
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,620
how did Dashun pass away so suddenly?

820
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,220
He was such a great man.

821
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,580
He died so young.

822
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,900
- Mrs. Chen.
- Please don't cry.

823
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,900
Mother, Shaozhong,

824
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,860
Yan,

825
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,580
come and sit in my room.

826
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,100
- I'm going there.
- Please.

827
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,340
I'll come to you later.

828
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,060
Okay. You should go.

829
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,540
- Go there.
- Take care.

830
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,220
Please don't cry.

831
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,900
This is your daughter with Dashun?

832
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,700
Mother, her name's Xuan.

833
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,260
Xuan, go

834
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,060
and call her Grandma.

835
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,660
Go to her.

836
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,700
Grandma!

837
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,780
Xuan, this is Uncle Shaozhong.

838
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,700
And this is Aunt Yan.

839
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,580
Uncle, Aunt.

840
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,500
How cruel fate has been to you two!

841
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,260
How will you ever manage
from here on out?

842
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,340
Mother,

843
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,700
Shaozhong,

844
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,300
don't worry.

845
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,140
Though Dashun is gone,

846
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,860
from now on,

847
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,700
I'll ensure Xuan and I live well.

848
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,540
Shaohua,

849
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,300
you must conform strictly

850
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,340
to widowhood customs henceforth.

851
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,940
Keep your words few and deeds many.

852
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,740
I hope Mrs. Chen

853
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,860
will treat you two kindly

854
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,900
for the sake of the late Dashun.

855
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,540
Mother,

856
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,620
I know what I am doing.

857
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,140
Mother,

858
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,460
Shaohua is clever and capable.

859
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,900
She won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

860
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,780
Don't worry.

861
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,380
Shaohua,

862
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,820
how could you let Ershun
seize all the family assets?

863
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,700
From now on,

864
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,020
I won't repeat such mistakes.

865
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,060
What do you mean?

866
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,620
I won't let pain cloud my judgment

867
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,660
and weaken my ability to handle things.

868
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:30,660
Shaohua,

869
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,020
what's your plan

870
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,340
moving forward?

871
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,220
Chen Ershun is a good-for-nothing.

872
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,900
He'll likely burn through

873
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,580
the entire Chen family fortune

874
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,260
in less than two years.

875
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,100
So I must devise a way

876
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,100
to start my own business

877
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,660
and forge a way out for myself and Xuan.

878
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,860
I've been wondering...

879
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,900
They're gone just like that.

880
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,100
Can Shaohua preserve her chastity?
