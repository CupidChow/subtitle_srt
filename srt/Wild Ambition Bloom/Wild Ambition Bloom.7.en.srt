So, instead of clutching it,

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,330
we may use it

33
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,770

for bullet and blade injuries,

172

unresolved heatstroke cases

180
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,220
will leave troops vulnerable to a chill.

181
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,500
That would complicate things further.

182
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,220
Thus, I've also added herbs

and external cold.

follow this prescription.

Truly admirable how dedicated you are!

186
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,900
Truthfully,

187
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,500
we'd rather turn away profits

188
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,020
than profit from war.

aren't ours to make.

All we can do

191

is hope that soldiers

00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,580
can avoid getting injured.

193
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,820
And if they do get wounded,

194
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,300
at least they may receive
the most timely

195
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,580
and effective medical aid possible

196
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,140

197
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,020
If only everyone could think like you,

198
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,540

219

220
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,460

221

I understand.

222
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,500
But I hope

223
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,660
that whichever apothecary
ultimately secures the order

224
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,940
will adhere to this standard.

225
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,020

and heat-induced cough.

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,020
and installing his concubine's cousin
in my place,

377
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,780
they will secure
all the military supply orders.

378
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,100
Alright.

379
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,100
Since they're breaking the rules,

380
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,300
don't blame me for playing dirty.

381
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,300
I've had that copy of Shun Pao

382
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,260
sent back to Shanxi.

383
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,500
Mr. Yan hates corruption above all else.

384
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,980
Just you wait.

385
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,180
Within three days,

386
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,860
someone will be packing up in disgrace

387
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,260
and heading home.

388
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,700
Mr. Lan,

389
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,580
what about our contract?

390
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,260
Let's sign it!

391
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,740
Right now!

392
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,660
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

393
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,100
I should also thank you

394
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,580
for coming up with such a clever trick.

395
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,900
What trick exactly?

396
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,500
Didn't you leak their private deal

397
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,700
to the reporter?

398
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,220
I thought you were behind it.

399
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,900
Not you?

400
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,380
How could it be me?

401
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,900
Then who could it be?

402
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,300
Never mind.

403
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,060
As long as
the business gets done, right?

404
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,060
Exactly!

405
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,580
- You're absolutely right.
- Mr. Lan.

406
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,060
What's wrong?

407
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,740
Read it.

408
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,800
[Shanghai Tian's Apothecary Selling
Substandard Drugs with Weak Efficacy]

409
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,820
That bastard Xia Yuan!

410
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,860
He pulled this on me!

411
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,540
Is your young mistress here?

412
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,540
Mr. Shang.

413
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,580
Apparently,

414
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,980
Peking's newspapers

415
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,500
are clashing with the Tian family,

416
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,060
while Shanghai's papers are relentlessly
targeting Shouyuan Apothecary.

417
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,780
Both sides are scrambling to expose

418
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,020
the procurement scandals
at these apothecaries.

419
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,100
Mr. Yan flew into a fury
upon learning this.

420
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,220
He ordered

421
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,740
to purchase medicines from any source

422
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,780
except from Shouyuan Apothecary

423
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,260
and Tian's Apothecary.

424
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,540
This time, both medicine firms

425
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,860
have really taken a massive hit.

426
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,940
Father, but it doesn't end there!

427
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,740
Mr. Yan has dismissed
both Mr. Xu and Mr. Lan,

428
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,260
recalling them from duty.

429
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,980
Mr. Shang is taking charge

430
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,940
of all procurement now.

431
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,740
And since he holds

432
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,860
our apothecary in such high regard,

433
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,540
everything just falls neatly into place.

434
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,740
Since when did our apothecary
become so famous?

435
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,260
Dashun,

436
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,660
how did Mr. Shang know

437
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,060
about our apothecary?

438
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,060
All thanks to Shaohua.

439
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:35,820
Her?

440
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,740
She just keeps accounts
and tallies inventory at the shop.

441
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,420
What merit could she possibly have?

442
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,780
Tell us

443
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,100
how you secured this order.

444
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,500
Nothing extraordinary about it.

445
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,540
Mr. Shang is a man

446
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,260
who takes his duties seriously.

447
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,020
Our medical supplies

448
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,140
are both top-grade and fairly priced.

449
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,940
That's why he felt confident

450
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
entrusting the order to us.

451
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,260
Shaohua,

452
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,900
you've been low-key all this time,

453
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,340
but what great service you've rendered!

454
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,540
Come now!

455
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,660
Let me raise a toast in your honor!

456
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,500
How can you toast her?

457
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,980
She should toast you.

458
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,900
I don't think so.

459
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,660
With just one clever move,

460
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,100
she netted 5,000 silver dollars!

461
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,380
Do you think I should toast her?

462
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,940
Five thousand silver dollars!

463
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,300
Just look at you now!

464
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,060
Oh my goodness!

465
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,980
Think of all the meat that could buy!

466
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,220
Well...

467
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,140
Come on.

468
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,020
Thank you, Father!

469
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,780
This is wonderful!

470
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
By the way, Father,

471
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,660
do you think I've repaid

472
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,780
those 200 silver dollars
from the accounts?

473
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,940
Yes.

474
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,220
Fully settled.

475
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,540
He only meant to spur you on
with that money.

476
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,460
I know.

477
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,580
How clever of you!

478
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,340
Shaohua,

479
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,220
you've grown thin.

480
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,780
Help yourself to whatever you like best.

481
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,020
Exactly! Shaohua, go ahead.

482
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,660
Thank you, Mother.

483
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,660
What a pity!

484
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,820
The collaboration on Yurong Powder

485
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,860
fell through.

486
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,660
Otherwise,

487
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,460
today we would've brought
another joyous occasion,

488
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,260
right?

489
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,100
Father,

490
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,740
sometimes, gains come
with losses in business.

491
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,780
True.

492
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,420
I originally

493
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,940
planned to leverage

494
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,580
the Shouyuan Apothecary incident

495
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,660
to elevate Chen's Apothecary

496
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,220
to new heights.

497
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,620
But now it seems

498
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,940
no matter what happens,

499
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,220
we ultimately have to rely on ourselves
and progress step by step.

500
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,940
Don't worry, Father.

501
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,300
As long as we stand united,

502
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,700
I believe our apothecary

503
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,980
will grow stronger each day.

504
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,020
Today, I want to make this clear.

505
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,300
Shouyuan Apothecary may lord

506
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,660
over others from on high now.

507
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,780
But someday sooner or later,

508
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,500
ours will surpass it

509
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,900
and become one of the top apothecaries

510
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,780
in all of Peking!

511
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
Shaohua,

512
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,700
well said!

513
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,980
Come on! Cheers!

514
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,420
Come on!

515
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,300
Cheers!

516
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
Mr. Xia.

517
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,260
Boss.

518
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,260
These

519
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,500
are the medicinal materials
I intend to bring back to Japan.

520
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,780
Would you help purchase them?

521
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,580
Mr. Komura,

522
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,860
our partnership has been so delightful

523
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
over all this time.

524
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,700
Please rest assured.

525
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,820
The medicinal materials

526
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,820
we supply to you

527
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,020
will unquestionably be
of the finest quality,

528
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,260
and our prices are the most competitive.

529
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,020
I'm truly grateful, Mr. Xia.

530
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,740
Additionally,

531
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,420
I have a small request.

532
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,220
Might you spare me
a few Chinese medicine prescriptions?

533
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,460
You're bringing this up again.

534
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,620
As I told you before,

535
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,780
I only sell medicine, not prescriptions.

536
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,540
I'll offer a handsome sum
for these prescriptions.

537
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,180
Like you,

538
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,580
money isn't an issue for me.

539
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,300
But

540
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,420
there is a way.

541
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,500
Please go ahead.

542
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,260
If you give me Komura Pharmaceuticals'
secret formulas,

543
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,700
then I'll give you mine.

544
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,700
Mr. Xia, are you joking?

545
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,180
So you know the reason.

546
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,060
Since things stand this way,

547
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,420
then

548
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,820
I shall take my leave now.

549
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,020
It's been a pleasure working with you.

550
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,540
Escort Mr. Komura back to his inn.

551
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,820
Father,

552
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,180
let's open a branch!

553
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,700
A single apothecary's reach

554
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,020
extends five li at most.

555
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,420
Instead of just one or two stores,

556
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,580
you should aim for ten, even 100.

557
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,340
Not just here in Peking,

558
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,460
but across the entire country.

559
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,220
Dashun,

560
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,820
do you know how much we need
to open a branch?

561
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,300
But the profit
from the military supply order

562
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,340
is just enough.

563
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,620
We've just scraped together
a small surplus,

564
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,660
but you're rushing
into opening a new branch.

565
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,500
Isn't that terribly hasty?

566
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,780
Father,

567
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,340
I actually believe

568
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,500
we must strike while the iron is hot.

569
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,300
While our Yurong Powder
is still enjoying peak popularity,

570
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,980
we should seize this moment
to firmly establish our reputation.

571
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,140
Even if Yurong Powder
may lose its sales appeal someday,

572
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,700
the Chen's brand will be renowned
far and wide by then.

573
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,940
Shaohua,

574
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,260
right now, Chen's Apothecary

575
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,060
is already overwhelmed.

576
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,340
If we open a branch,

577
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,500
this

578
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,300
will stretch us far too thin.

579
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,940
The branch and the main store may seem
like two separate businesses,

580
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,900
but it's actually the same operations,

581
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,500
merely moving half of the inventory

582
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,060
to another location for sale.

583
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,980
This means earning twice the profit
from doing one thing.

584
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,020
Father, I've done the calculations.

585
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,820
After deducting
this military supply order,

586
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,700
our apothecary's annual profit amounts

587
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,780
to merely 3,000 silver dollars.

588
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,700
But things will be different
once we open a branch.

589
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,540
Combined yearly earnings from both

590
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,780
would reach 8,000 silver dollars!

591
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,340
With that much capital,

592
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,620
buying more farmland is a safer bet.

593
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,740
Anyway, I've heard that back in the day,

594
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,100
Xia Yuan would open branches
in every major commercial hub,

595
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,820
even if he had to borrow money.

596
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,260
Once the branches operated
as one cohesive force,

597
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,780
he could dictate terms

598
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,300
whether with his customers or suppliers.

599
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,380
Only thus did Shouyuan Apothecary

600
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,540
attain its current stature.

601
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,020
Exactly! This is precisely the logic.

602
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,620
Once we open branches

603
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,060
and establish our reputation,

604
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,740
our customer base
will grow significantly.

605
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,700
With more customers,

606
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,140
we can secure reliable supply channels
more easily,

607
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,260
followed by lower procurement costs.

608
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,060
And when costs decrease,

609
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,620
we'll ultimately make more profit.

610
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,060
Spill it.

611
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,420
What exactly happened?

612
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,700
Boss,

613
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,980
I failed to handle this properly.

614
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,020
I'll accept any punishment.

615
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,940
Punishment aside.

616
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,740
Do you truly understand

617
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,060
how we lost this deal?

618
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes.

619
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,980
We underestimated the rival.

620
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,060
Focused solely on entertaining Mr. Xu,

621
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,380
yet never anticipated

622
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,500
Mr. Tian would be so despicable.

623
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,540
But ultimately,

624
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,460
he also failed to secure this order.

625
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,260
Indeed.

626
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,580
A tiny apothecary snatched it away.

627
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,740
A tiny apothecary?

628
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,300
Just how tiny?

629
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,420
Chen's Apothecary.

630
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,380
Precisely that very Chen's Apothecary.

631
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,340
They got lucky this time.

632
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,820
What exists in business

633
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,220
isn't luck, but only competence.

634
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,780
Yes.

635
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,060
You ordered someone to do all this?

636
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,420
Yeah.

637
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,100
He had no choice.

638
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,100
Yes.

639
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,660
Mr. Tian instigated reporters
in Shanghai

640
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,020
to attack us first.

641
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,940
I was forced to retaliate.

642
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,180
But why would those Shanghai reporters

643
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,220
know such detailed information?

644
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,100
Mr. Tian told them.

645
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,100
And who told Mr. Tian?

646
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
I'm not entirely sure about that.

647
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,580
Aside from our own people,

648
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
who else would know

649
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
your interactions with Mr. Xu?

650
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,940
Only a few in Bada Hutong.

651
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,060
Bada Hutong?

652
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,100
Back then, Yurong Powder

653
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,100
first made its name there.

654
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,540
Exactly!

655
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,260
Boss,

656
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,860
are you suspecting

657
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,020
Chen's Apothecary is behind this?

658
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,020
Isn't it perfectly plausible?

659
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,900
After all, they ultimately profit!

660
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,620
Since you're all so confident,

661
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,780
let's open a branch then.

662
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,380
But

663
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,420
we must agree

664
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,620
I'll personally oversee the main store,

665
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,140
while Dashun and you

666
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,340
will manage

667
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,780
the new branch.

668
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,820
Thank you, Father.

669
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:13,980
Father,

670
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,260
Dashun and I

671
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,980
can manage the branch.

672
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,860
But I have one condition.

673
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,620
What is it?

674
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,500
We want 50%

675
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,340
of the branch's shares.

676
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,140
What?

677
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,660
Your father and I are still alive!

678
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,580
Are you trying to split up the family?

679
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,420
No, we are not.

680
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,460
Just to get
the family accounts straight.

681
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,180
You may do that.

682
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,220
But why do you expect shares?

683
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,300
Over the years,

684
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,300
just the revenue

685
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,060
from Yurong Powder alone

686
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,340
has accounted for half
of Chen's Apothecary's income.

687
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,260
And I secured

688
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,700
the military supply order.

689
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,780
Thus, we have money to open a branch.

690
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,860
Therefore, demanding 50% of shares

691
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,900
is hardly excessive.

692
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,980
What is a share?

693
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,060
You were rewarded

694
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,660
with 20 silver dollars.

695
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,460
Not even Dashun or Ershun received any.

696
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,300
Why should you demand shares?

697
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,100
Mother!

698
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,620
Those counter clerks

699
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,540
work mindlessly,

700
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,100
yet still get paid monthly wages

701
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,500
and year-end bonuses.

702
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,740
Wouldn't that total

703
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,700
more than 20 silver dollars?

704
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,060
You hear that?

705
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,500
She's saying you gave her too little.

706
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,380
Father, it's not about the money.

707
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,300
All I want is to feel truly valued.

708
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,980
I'm willing to put in the effort

709
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,780
and bring home profits.

710
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,940
But everything we do
deserves a proper title.

711
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,180
You married into the Chen family.

712
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,980
And what title do you want?

713
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,900
Boss,

714
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,140
I've just recalled something.

715
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,380
When our head manager first met Mr. Xu,

716
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,780
people from Chen's Apothecary

717
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,580
were also at the Grand Hotel.

718
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,700
Besides, their young mistress

719
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,340
showed specific interest

720
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,260
in our securing
the military supply order.

721
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,620
Let's talk about Yurong Powder.

722
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,580
How did the negotiations go
with Chen's Apothecary?

723
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,540
Didn't work out.

724
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,780
Why?

725
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,060
Here is the case.

726
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,540
They wouldn't share their secret formula

727
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,260
and rejected a 60-40 profit split.

728
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,260
Later, when I offered a 50-50 split,

729
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,140
their attitude seemed to ease somewhat.

730
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,940
But suddenly, they insisted

731
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,500
on promoting exclusively
under the Chen's brand.

732
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,180
In this case,

733
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,300
nothing left to discuss.

734
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,380
Remarkable!

735
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,820
Seems I've underestimated

736
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,180
Mr. Chen all along.

737
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,420
Mr. Chen

738
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,980
is seasoned and unflappable,

739
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,260
yet in my opinion,

740
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,980
the truly strong one in this family

741
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,860
is Mrs. Chen Junior.

742
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,340
She's the mind behind Yurong Powder.

743
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,860
Mrs. Chen Junior.

744
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,820
Father,

745
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,860
how about this?

746
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,180
Let's not divide the shares for now.

747
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,580
Shaohua

748
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,180
can just stay at home for now.

749
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
I'll take full charge

750
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,620
of managing the branch myself.

751
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,780
Can you really do this alone?

752
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,220
I certainly wouldn't know

753
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,140
how to come up with Yurong Powder

754
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,020
or land a military supply order.

755
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,740
But as for running an apothecary,

756
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,500
that I can definitely handle.

757
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,740
Is it just about handling it?

758
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,820
I suppose I can manage.

759
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,380
But listen,

760
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,580
if I focus entirely

761
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,460
on running the branch,

762
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,340
I won't have the capacity
for the main store.

763
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,700
You'll need someone else there.

764
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,020
But if you

765
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,180
hire such a person,

766
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,300
he needs to be capable.

767
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,420
He should be trustworthy, huh?

768
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,820
But frankly,

769
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,780
hiring such a person won't be easy.

770
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,740
And if you want to keep him around,

771
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,540
you'll have to

772
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,980
offer him some shares.

773
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,580
How hard can it be to hire someone?

774
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,460
Mother, listen to me.

775
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,020
It's definitely not easy! Why?

776
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,460
There are many soldiers,
but few good leaders.

777
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,580
Since that's the case,

778
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,340
you'll get 50% of the shares

779
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,820
in the branch.

780
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,420
Thank you, Father.

781
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,100
Thank you, Father.

782
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,260
No need, I also have one condition.

783
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,780
The annual profit

784
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,980
of this branch

785
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,660
must not fall
below 4,000 silver dollars.

786
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,420
No problem.

787
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,900
We can put all of these
into the document.

788
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,300
We're all family here.

789
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,620
Why would we need a document?

790
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,660
Am I really expected

791
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,700
to break my promise?

792
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,380
Father,

793
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,660
that's not what I meant!

794
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm just worried

795
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,020
if I fail to earn this sum someday,

796
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,140
and if you want to punish me for that,

797
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,060
at least there'll be clear rules
to follow.

798
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,660
Young lady,

799
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,540
I have faith in you.

800
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,420
You'll certainly manage just fine.

801
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,460
Thank you, Father.

802
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,540
Alright, it's getting late.

803
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,180
Time for bed.

804
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,660
Thank you, Father.

805
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,580
Mother, we'll head back now.

806
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,940
Do get some rest yourself.

807
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,620
This decided?

808
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,820
Off to sleep.

809
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,660
Happy?

810
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,060
What's the matter?

811
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,780
When did you start using
strategic withdrawal?

812
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,820
I learned it from you.

813
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,620
Well done.

814
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,580
That's all?

815
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,380
Keep your voice down.

816
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,140
- Don't wake Xuan.
- That's all?

817
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,000
[Chen's Apothecary]

818
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,580
Hello.

819
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,580
How is it going?

820
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,100
You look worn out. Here you are.

821
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,180
Another bowl.

822
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,580
I've picked out a house.

823
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,740
We'll sign the deed tomorrow.

824
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,260
Carpenters, stonemasons, and roofers
are all set.

825
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,300
We can place
the furniture order tomorrow.

826
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,900
And I'll visit the broker house
the day after tomorrow.

827
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,900
Don't push yourself too hard.

828
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,780
I-I'm not tired.

829
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,980
I just can't wait
till our branch opens its doors!

830
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
Nearly there.

831
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,900
Oh, your letter.

832
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,100
My letter?

833
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,700
Right.

834
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,020
From Shanghai.

835
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,900
[Att.: Chu Shaohua]
That must be from Erniu.

836
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,380
Did she hire someone to write for her?

837
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,260
The penmanship is quite good.

838
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,260
Shaohua, my beloved sister,

839
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,020
I have found my footing

840
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,180
at a silk factory.

841
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,340
Even before setting eyes upon Shanghai,

842
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,180
I had glimpsed its immensity
and splendor.

843
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,260
Yet being here,

844
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,820
I've seen its wonders

845
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,900
beyond any storybook description.

846
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,020
My earnest prayer
is that you will be here soon

847
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,420
to manifest your grandest visions.

848
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
What did Erniu say?

849
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,700
Dashun,

850
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,820
let's open our next branch

851
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,980
in Shanghai!

852
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,260
Great!

853
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,300
Then, for the fourth one,

854
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,140
let's open it in Guangzhou.

855
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,260
Alright.

856
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,140
And the one after that,

857
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,100
let's open it...

858
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,860
in Hankou.

859
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
How about Hankou?

860
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,940
Okay.

861
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,580
You can open them wherever you want.

862
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,060
And then in Chengdu.

863
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,220
Great! Chengdu's perfect.

864
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,620
We'll expand our stores

865
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,300
across the entire country!

866
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,100
One city at a time.

867
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Exactly, step by step.

868
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,540
First, conquer Shanghai.

869
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,420
We'll have to give it our all!

870
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,100
Why has she been crying

871
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,700
all day long?

872
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,140
Doesn't want me to leave.

873
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,980
Xuan,

874
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,340
- he will be back very soon.
- Alright now.

875
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,780
Right.

876
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll bring you tasty treats.
Be a good child.

877
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,420
When will you be back?

878
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,660
Father wants to collect
the remaining payment

879
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,180
and connect the medicine traders
in Shanxi.

880
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,580
It'll take at least half a month.

881
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,580
Alright. You'll make it
to our branch's opening.

882
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,780
When I return,
we'll unveil the signboard together.

883
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,100
We finally have our own business.

884

Shaohua,

885
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,700
you've truly endured so much
over these past few years.

886
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,500
Why do you say that?

887
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,900
Look,

888
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,820
you always wanted
to explore the outside world,

889
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,500
to build something of your own.

890
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,860
Yet it took till now,
till this very day.

891
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,180
Everything is turning out
quite well now.

892
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,180

what's destined to arrive

894
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,900
will find its way to us.

895
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,580
Be careful on your journey.

896
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,740
Don't worry.

are also heading to Shanxi on business.

900
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,820
There'll be four or five of us
along the way.

00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,420
Nothing untoward will happen.

902

00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,460
tomorrow I'll go and ask
at Wei Donglai's place.

937
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,860
No tears, Xuan.

938
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,540
I'm right here. Shh, hush now.

939
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,180
Everything is going to be fine.

940
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,900
Father will be home in just a few days

941
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,420
and bring you special goodies!

942
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,500
I've got you. No tear.

943
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,140
Shh. Sit right here on my lap.

944
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,100
Hug. Shh.

945
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,660
Shh.

946
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,020
My sweetheart, quiet now.

947
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,220
Hush now.

948
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,220
[Donglai Apothecary]

949
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,860
I only just learned

950
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,700
plague has broken out in Shanxi.

951
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,060
Mr. Yan sealed off all routes
into and out of Shanxi,

952
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,780
so your father, Dashun

953
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,700
and our two clerks

954
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,780
are all trapped there.

955
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,540
How long will they be trapped there?

956
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,540
Hard to say.

957
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,140
The plague?

958
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,820
Your father and Dashun…

959
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,740
Mother,

960
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,380
they're temporarily trapped.

961
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,380
Once the plague subsides,

962
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,700
and the blockade is lifted,

963
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,100
they'll surely return.

964
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,420
Plague kills people!

965
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,620
But Mother, rest assured.

966
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,060
Father and Dashun have decades
of experience in this trade.

967
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,540
They surely know
how to administer remedies

968
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,500
and guard against infection.
