00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,810
Let alone saving him, I'm lenient enough

191
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,020
to not throw him into the Huangpu River.

192
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,300
Please calm down.

193
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,810
Also,

194
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,900
keep an eye on Chu Shaohua.

195
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,180
Once things die down,

196
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,730
we'll find a chance to get rid of her.

197
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,610
Otherwise, my eyelid keeps twitching.

198
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,570
Got it!

199
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,420
Mu Ziru will behave for a while.

200
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,930
But I feel that

201
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,730
he'll look for chances to attack you.

202
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,660
I hope that seed takes root quickly.

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,970
Miss Chu, someone wants to see you.

204
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,970
Who is it?

205
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,810
I don't know them.

206
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,420
Where are they?

207
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,090
At the main gate.

208
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,610
Shaohua.

209
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,450
Shaohua,

210
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,610
you're still so pretty.

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,730
Greet your aunt.

212
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,900
Hello!

213
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,420
Shaohua,

214
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,300
great!

215
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,570
Great to see you!

216
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,970
Come in and take a seat!

217
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,140
Please come in.

218
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,180
Shaozhong,

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,690
has Mother been in good health
these years?

220
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,500
It's all my fault

221
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,180
for not taking good care of her.

222
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,210
After you jumped off the cliff,

223
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,420
she became terribly depressed.

224
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,970
And soon after,

225
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,180
she passed away.

226
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,140
She fell ill and lay bedridden
for six months.

227
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,690
Passed away on the morning
of the 13th of the 12th month in 1923.

228
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,420
After she left us,

229
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,540
life grew harder each day.

230
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,090
Yan suggested

231
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,930
we go make our fortune in Peking.

232
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,520
I agreed with her.

233
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,730
So we sold off all our fields and house,

234
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,300
and headed to Peking.

235
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,020
You sold the fields Dashun redeemed?

236
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,210
It was unavoidable.

237
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,060
Year after year of severe drought,

238
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,300
we couldn't collect rent.

239
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,020
These fields couldn't

240
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,970
bring us enough food.

241
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,570
So how did you manage in Peking?

242
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,570
When we were first there,

243
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,060
I tried running a small business.

244
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,330
But it was tough going.

245
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,730
Within less than a year,

246
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,780
I lost all of my capital.

247
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,300
We couldn't go back to Qizhou,

248
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,300
so I had to pull a rickshaw.

249
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,690
Yan worked as a domestic helper,

250
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,780
just scraping by for meals.

251
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,060
Eat now.

252
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,180
Talk while we dine.

253
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,020
Why aren't you eating?

254
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,020
I am.

255
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,690
Then

256
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,090
how did you know I am here?

257
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,970
This is pure coincidence!

258
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,690
One day while pulling my rickshaw,

259
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,140
I met a fellow townsman,

260
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,020
clerk of Shouyuan Apothecary.

261
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,570
He said you were here

262
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,810
and you

263
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,450
were doing business

264
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,690
with Mr. Xia Yuan.

265
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,090
When I heard that,

266
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,660
I was overjoyed!

267
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,380
Because you're still alive

268
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,970
and have made something of yourself!

269
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,570
So on the same night,

270
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,330
I rushed straight here

271
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,730
for you with them.

272
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,570
Eat.

273
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,380
Okay.

274
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,060
Shaozhong.

275
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,020
Mr. Wen!

276
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,210
I want more pork ribs!

277
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,810
Okay, I'll order some later.

278
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,060
And braised pork belly.

279
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,900
Got it.

280
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,780
Join us, Mr. Wen!

281
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,730
Don't worry about me. Enjoy it.

282
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,850
I'll get back to handling things.

283
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,780
I'm leaving now.

284
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,380
I'll treat you
to Western food another day!

285
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,300
Okay!

286
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,260
Wonderful!

287
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,260
We've never tried Western food!

288
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,610
Let me walk him out.

289
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,930
Don't bother.

290
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,180
- Please stay seated.
- Take care on your way.

291
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,420
Eat now.

292
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,540
Take a vacation the next few days

293
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,210
and show them around.

294
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,730
The car and driver are yours to use.

295
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,690
Thank you.

296
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,970
Do you have enough bedding and pillows?

297
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,730
I can send someone to bring some by.

298
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,420
No need.

299
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,900
Once they finish eating,

300
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,780
I'll take them straight to a hotel.

301
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,660
Won't be using your place?

302
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,020
Fine.

303
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,900
Also,

304
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,210
pay no attention

305
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,540
to whatever

306
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,140
they say to you.

307
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,020
If they ask you to do something,

308
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,570
without my approval,

309
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,450
absolutely refuse.

310
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,180
Got it.

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,780
Thank you.

312
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,740
So many houses!

313
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,090
Heavens!

314
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,500
Look at their dressing.

315
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,610
Bao, look!

316
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,980
Foreigners!

317
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,130
Mother, what's that?

318
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,460
I want to eat it.

319
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,220
Stop fussing now.

320
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,850
I have no money.

321
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,780
Shaohua will buy it for you later.

322
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,540
Shaohua,

323
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,780
how much does this car cost?

324
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,500
I think

325
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,890
around 2,000 silver dollars.

326
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,890
Two thousand?

327
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,460
Two thousand!

328
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,090
You must've made good money these years!

329
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,780
It isn't mine.

330
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,330
It belongs to the company.

331
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,460
How much

332
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,980
do you make at the company?

333
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,020
Just enough to get by.

334
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,890
Bao,

335
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,460
how does this outfit look on me?

336
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,330
Is it nice?

337
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,300
What do you think?

338
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,020
Look great!

339
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,170
Please select him
a pair of leather shoes.

340
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,370
I see, please wait a moment.

341
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,940
Shaohua, don't bother.

342
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,460
I'd also like a pair of leather shoes.

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,540
These…

344
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,610
Excuse me.

345
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,130
Stand still.

346
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,940
A pair for her as well.

347
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,890
Alright.

348
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,020
Doesn't this blue qipao look lovely?

349
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,810
Yes.

350
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,410
That red one was also gorgeous.

351
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,850
Both suit me perfectly!

352
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,780
Shaohua, why don't we keep both?

353
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,090
Just one will do.

354
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,500
Getting two is throwing money away!

355
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,890
It's Shaohua's treat for me!

356
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,170
Right, Shaohua?

357
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,260
Thanks.

358
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,410
Thank you. Wrap them up, please.

359
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,170
Got it.

360
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,570
This coat is stunning!

361
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,980
Winter's coming soon.

362
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,260
When wearing a qipao,

363
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,020
I need a matching overcoat.

364
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,700
Shaozhong, move aside.

365
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,610
Let me see!

366
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,020
Look at my figure

367
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,130
and my style!

368
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,980
Inferior to the modern ladies here?

369
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,500
Not at all!

370
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,980
How about compared to Shaohua?

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,570
About the same!

372
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,610
Shaohua has money

373
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,130
and knows how to dress well.

374
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,460
If I fix myself up,

375
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,170
I might outshine her a bit.

376
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,850
I'm talking to you!

377
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,940
I'm listening.

378
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,060
We must make

379
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,610
this trip here valuable.

380
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,460
Sure.

381
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,460
Look at what Shaohua bought for us,

382
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,570
food, clothes, daily necessities,

383
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,300
and toys and school supplies for Bao!

384
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,780
We're heading back fully loaded.

385
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,740
Heading where?

386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,740
Peking!

387
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,460
Wait! Why go back to Peking?

388
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,410
She owns property, cars,
and a business here.

389
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,260
But those things

390
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,410
are her achievements.

391
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,130
Just be happy for her.

392
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,940
It's unrelated to us.

393
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:48,850
You're her brother,

394
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,980
and should be half in charge of her.

395
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,460
Half of her things

396
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,460
rightfully belongs to you.

397
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,460
Listen.

398
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,500
You can say these things to my face,

399
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,540
but never repeat them to her.

400
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,700
You know how fiery her temper is!

401
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,540
Fine then!

402
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,460
Even if she refuses to acknowledge you,

403
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,330
surely she must recognize Bao

404
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,780
as her nephew.

405
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,060
He's her only heir!

406
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,460
When she passes away someday,

407
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,410
all her money will go to Bao.

408
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,980
What are you saying?

409
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,850
How dare you curse her death!

410
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,090
I was discussing with you

411
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,260
for staying here, right?

412
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,780
Seriously,

413
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,540
you want to go back,

414
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,850
live in that ramshackle hovel,

415
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,810
pull that decrepit rickshaw,

416
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,370
slurp cheap cornmeal porridge,

417
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,370
and chomp wowotou?

418
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,170
When we were in our hometown,

419
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,540
everyone said Peking was paradise.

420
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,500
But now that I'm here,

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,700
I feel this place

422
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,020
is where people truly belong.

423
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,740
Shanghai is more business-driven.

424
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,700
Shaozhong is a talent.

425
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,890
To really thrive,

426
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,300
he has to come here.

427
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,700
Peking is not good for him.

428
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,170
He needs to stay in Shanghai.

429
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,370
What's his specialty?

430
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,410
Didn't Shaohua mention it?

431
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,500
He dealt in medicinal herbs.

432
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:31,940
Here.

433
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,410
Just had bad luck these past years,

434
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,700
so never quite made it work.

435
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,410
I see.

436
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,090
Thanks.

437
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,220
Shaozhong,

438
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,500
Bao turned 13 this year, right?

439
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,090
Which grade is he in?

440
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,330
Shaohua, listen to yourself!

441
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,220
With the pittance he made,

442
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,260
school's out of the question.

443
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,060
Bao just learns a few characters.

444
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,020
Shaohua,

445
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,220
days ago while shopping downtown,

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,780
I passed by several primary schools.

447
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,570
I really wish

448
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,650
that Bao could attend

449
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,610
a primary school

450
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,410
in Shanghai.

451
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,220
Bao.

452
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,780
When it comes to education,

453
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,170
Peking has a richer academic vibe.

454
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,410
But money's tight.

455
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,090
Bao,

456
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,330
use the fork and knife.

457
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,060
Let's go

458
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,130
to wash your hands.

459
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,330
I'll fix your meal shortly! Go.

460
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,740
Here.

461
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,500
Wash up.

462
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,370
Here's a soap.

463
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,810
Rub it between your hands
till it lathers.

464
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,850
That'll get all the grease off.

465
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,020
Bao,

466
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,410
do you want to go to school?

467
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,570
No.

468
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,060
So what do you want to be later?

469
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,940
I want to learn to pull a rickshaw!

470
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,220
But that job pays peanuts.

471
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,060
If you study at school,

472
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,130
read books and gain knowledge,

473
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,130
you could earn way more.

474
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,740
I don't need to earn money.

475
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,370
Your cash is mine anyway!

476
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,610
Who told you that?

477
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,740
My mother did.

478
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,780
She said I'm your heir.

479
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,130
After your death,

480
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,810
your car and house will be mine.

481
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,060
Dry your hands.

482
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,850
Head back first.

483
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,890
I'll wash up

484
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,850
and be right there.

485
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,540
Mr. Wen, how booming your business is!

486
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,940
Your pharmacy must be shorthanded, huh?

487
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,500
How about hiring Shaozhong?

488
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,370
Our staffing matters

489
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,810
are handled mainly by Shaohua.

490
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,890
If you have any requests,

491
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,700
speak directly with her.

492
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,890
I'm sure
she'll make the best arrangements.

493
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,460
Got it.

494
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,650
Shaohua is too shy

495
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,850
to ask directly,

496
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,890
so she sent me instead!

497
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,540
Alright. Later I'll…

498
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,410
Mr. Wen, let's proceed with this.

499
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,170
We've got a deal.

500
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,890
Tomorrow morning,

501
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,700
Shaozhong will start working
at your place.

502
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,260
Alright?

503
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,410
You're so kind to Shaozhong.

504
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,370
Shaohua will hold this kindness dear.

505
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,020
As they team by your side,

506
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,060
your venture shall flourish.

507
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,330
Right, Shaozhong?

508
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,370
Let's propose a toast to Mr. Wen!

509
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,940
Well.

510
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,020
Come on, Mr. Wen.

511
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,540
To your thriving enterprise,

512
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,220
ceaseless prosperity,

513
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,980
golden harvests each dawn!

514
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,300
Come on!

515
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,260
Shoahua, while you were absent,

516
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,650
Mr. Wen has offered Shaozhong a position

517
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,130
at Wen's Pharmacy.

518
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,060
We accepted the offer.

519
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,810
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

520
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,460
But they must

521
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,850
return to Peking tomorrow.

522
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,740
They can't accept it.

523
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,220
Who said we're returning to Peking?

524
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,500
I did.

525
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,170
I've purchased

526
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,570
your return ticket to Peking

527
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,890
at first light tomorrow.

528
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,130
Why leave?

529
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,740
We're not leaving!

530
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,090
We are leaving!

531
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,610
Have it your way.

532
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,300
The hotel fee

533
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,610
covers through the weekend.

534
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,370
Mr. Wen...

535
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,060
Then allow me to wish you

536
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,740
a safe journey.

537
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,610
You just made some money.

538
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,980
Must you do that?

539
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,300
Even turned your back on your brother.

540
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,370
Zhou Yan.

541
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,850
Hear this.

542
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,220
Your glory won't last forever!

543
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,570
When misfortune strikes,

544
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,370
don't accuse us of abandonment.

545
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,020
Zhou Yan.

546
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,940
Chu Xiaobao, go.

547
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,330
Stop eating.

548
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,410
She doesn't even want to see you. Stop.

549
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,700
Zhou Yan.

550
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,020
Mr. Wen,

551
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,740
my deepest apologies.

552
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,780
Shaohua,

553
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,060
I…

554
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,780
Must things come to this?

555
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,330
I've repeatedly said

556
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,570
this is my family business.

557
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:51,980
They're your relatives.

558
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,850
You never know my experience,

559
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,300
Mr. Wen.

560
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,410
I assumed those experiences

561
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,130
would reform her character.

562
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,890
Instead, she's grown twice as bad!

563
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,330
She treats us like thieves.

564
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,780
Typically wealthy but heartless.

565
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,980
Oh, that's harsh!

566
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,570
Just look at everything she bought us.

567
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,170
Can't label her as heartless.

568
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,810
Only these crumbs?

569
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,220
Just this?

570
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,410
This is dust in the wind

571
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,170
to her fortune.

572
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,500
Dust in the wind?

573
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,610
Why should she bother?

574
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,060
Could've skipped it entirely!

575
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,220
Zhou Yan,

576
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,090
you're being greedy.

577
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,980
Yes! I am greedy!

578
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,540
But that's

579
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,940
for you, for Bao

580
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,740
and for our family!

581
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,170
Chu Shaozhong,

582
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,850
if only you had real skill,

583
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,220
if you could earn cars

584
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,700
and mansions for us here,

585
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,810
I wouldn't have been tempted

586
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,370
and refused others' handouts.

587
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,220
Mark my words!

588
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,540
I can also be generous!

589
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:12,130
But you lack the spine for it!

590
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,460
You can't support us
by pulling a rickshaw.

591
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,700
I have to be a servant for others,

592
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,570
washing clothes and cooking for them.

593
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,980
Chu Shaozhong,

594
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,610
in front of Shaohua,

595
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,170
you don't even dare to say no.

596
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,330
Except sleeping and sighing,

597
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,460
what else do you dare to do?

598
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,540
Thank you.

599
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,700
Shaozhong.

600
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,460
Shaohua.

601
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,500
It's getting late.

602
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,650
What's wrong?

603
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,330
Nothing major,

604
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,370
just came to bid farewell.

605
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,260
We're heading back to Peking tomorrow.

606
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,540
Don't know when we'll meet again.

607
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,740
So I dropped by

608
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,700
despite the hour,

609
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,700
share a few words from the heart.

610
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,940
Peking and Shanghai aren't worlds apart.

611
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,330
Meeting's easy if we want it.

612
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,780
If you want to see me,

613
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,410
just hop on a train anytime.

614
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,980
And when duty calls me north,

615
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,370
I'll visit you.

616
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,650
I see.

617
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,810
But what I want to say is this.

618
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,700
First,

619
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,500
on behalf of our entire family,

620
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,260
my deepest apologies

621
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,940
for the burden we've become.

622
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,810
You

623
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,570
have always

624
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,570
been fiercely loyal,

625
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,890
then and now.

626
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,460
You're generous

627
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,940
during our visit.

628
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,610
As for Zhou Yan,

629
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,220
I think

630
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,610
she speaks her mind bluntly.

631
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,940
Please

632
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,890
brush off her words.

633
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,570
She is more than speaking bluntly.

634
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,300
Blame me. My weakness forced her

635
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,410
into this lifelong ordeal,

636
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,650
so she harbors resentment.

637
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,890
Stop shouldering

638
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,220
all blame yourself.

639
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,940
Younger me would've
never admitted defeat.

640
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,940
But at forty-something,

641
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,460
I see myself clearly.

642
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,940
Failed to protect our family legacy

643
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,850
and gambled away the final fields.

644
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,410
But for you,

645
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,020
I'd have perished long ago.

646
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,570
Shaohua,

647
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,370
ever wonder

648
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:42,810
what haunts me most?

649
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,610
That bandit raid,

650
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,300
when I failed

651
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,980
to protect you.

652
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,370
I really hate myself.

653
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,300
Had I shown more courage then,

654
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,370
perhaps I'd have saved you.

655
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,650
Don't speak that way.

656
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,500
You were brave back then.

657
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,540
Had it not been for you,

658
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,090
I'd likely be lost to bandits

659
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,740
and wouldn't have been who I am.

660
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,980
To become who you are,

661
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,260
you must have suffered, huh?

662
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,810
It's alright.

663
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,780
Shaohua,

664
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,500
let me speak from the heart.

665
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,460
We never came

666
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,980
to exploit you

667
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,020
or seek gains.

668
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,370
I trust you.

669
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,410
After you vanished with that horse,

670
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,650
rumors swirled.

671
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,370
Suicide leaps,

672
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,980
bandit murders,

673
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,540
even becoming a chieftain's bride.

674
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,020
My soul

675
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,220
refused peace.

676
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,980
Hearing you were alive,

677
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,650
I rushed here instantly

678
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,460
for nothing else,

679
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,020
but just to see

680
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,410
how time has shaped you

681
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,740
and how life treats you.

682
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm good.

683
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm fine.

684
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,410
Seeing you

685
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,460
thrive here

686
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,220
truly lifts my spirits.

687
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,370
My heart

688
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,300
can finally rest easy.

689
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,780
Shaohua,

690
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,460
though I'm older,

691
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,370
you've always outshone me,

692
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,170
wit and wisdom alike.

693
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,700
Before leaving,

694
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,500
I have no advice.

695
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,770
Just one thing.

696
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,940
Shanghai's hard solo.

697
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,170
Should someone worthy cross your path,

698
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,770
build a home.

699
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,540
That'll let me sleep soundly

700
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,020
in Peking.

701
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,420
I see.

702
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,650
Alright.

703
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,650
Nothing else.

704
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,730
I'm leaving.

705
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,820
Take care.

706
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,500
No more crying.

707
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,980
Shaozhong.

708
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,280
[Wen's Pharmacy]

709
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,020
Shaozhong, you will work as a pharmacist

710
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,340
and Yan shall oversee
the workshop storehouse.

711
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,420
Under Wen's Pharmacy rules,

712
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,020
beyond monthly base pay,

713
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,770
extra silver flows.

714
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,770
Work diligently,

715
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,650
and your earnings shall surpass

716
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,730
Peking's tenfold.

717
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,770
Enough to cover lodging, meals,

718
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,420
and necessities with ease.

719
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,380
Splendid!

720
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,690
Fear not.

721
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,900
We shall uphold our family's honor!

722
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,500
Also, I've settled
Bao's school enrollment.

723
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,340
As to his grade placement,

724
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,130
the school will decide

725
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,290
based on his entrance assessment.

726
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,690
Fret not over tuition, incidental fees,

727
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,730
nor textbook fee.

728
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,820
All expenses fall to me.

729
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,730
- Shaohua.
- Shaohua.

730
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,210
That's great.

731
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,210
Shaohua,

732
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,290
thank you very much.

733
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,290
Yet I must make it clear.

734
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,340
Within our home, you're my family.

735
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,420
But cross this threshold,

736
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,130
and you become our staff.

737
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,940
Every regulation of Wen's Pharmacy

738
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,610
must be honored without compromise.

739
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,250
Transgressions shall meet

740
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,340
with disciplinary consequences.

741
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,770
No, no mistakes will occur!

742
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,210
Rest assured. We won't.

743
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,980
No problem.

744
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,500
Li.

745
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,610
Ms. Chu!

746
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,340
Come here.

747
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,770
Get them started with onboarding.

748
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,860
Got it.

749
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,170
Thank you.

750
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,980
Right this way, please.

751
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,900
Li, how long have you been here?

752
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,650
Two years now.

753
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,860
Ms. Chu.

754
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,290
Mr. Wen.

755
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,570
That seed is sprouting.

756
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,820
The merchant claimed
they were herbs from Hankou,

757
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,860
but porters secretly opened a sack

758
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,570
and found opium inside.

759
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,420
How much?

760
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,340
Twenty dan.

761
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,980
Where's the cargo from?

762
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,090
A Suzhou trading firm.

763
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,090
Checked, no heavyweight backers.

764
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,340
Perfect.

765
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,610
Time to pull off something major.

766
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,340
Tell all men

767
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,690
to act at midnight tonight.

768
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,020
Come back.

769
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,020
Keep secret.

770
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,690
Got it.

771
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,340
Open the door!

772
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,770
The Enforcement Office
of Opium Suppression Bureau!

773
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,650
Open up!

774
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,460
Pry it open!

775
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,770
Hurry!

776
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,290
Break down the door!

777
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,730
Open the door!

778
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,250
Open the door!

779
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,290
Open the door now!

780
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,570
Hurry and open the door.

781
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,940
Open the door!

782
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,570
Open the door!

783
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,730
Open the door!

784
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,570
Mr. Mu,

785
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,730
over there!

786
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,210
High-grade stuff?

787
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:17,770
Right.

788
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,860
Why so little?

789
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,540
We've only found these for now.

790
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,020
But you said 20 dan.

791
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,170
This barely makes two!

792
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,980
They're still searching.

793
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,570
Turn over every inch.

794
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,650
Scour every corner!

795
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,130
Mr, Mu, we've searched everywhere,

796
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,860
but nothing.

797
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,730
Keep digging.

798
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,940
And those wooden crates

799
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,690
and those hemp sacks?

800
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,500
Scrutinize very carefully.

801
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,060
Ask the gatekeeper here.

802
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,380
He fled when he smelled trouble.

803
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,730
They do have sense.

804
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,570
Mr. Mu, we've searched again,

805
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,570
but nothing.

806
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,730
Could the intel be wrong?

807
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,730
I remember they said 20 dan.

808
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,210
Well, two dan count too.

809
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,340
At least we didn't draw a blank.

810
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,560
[Enforcement Office
of Jiangsu Opium Suppression Bureau]

811
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:11,770
As instructed,

812
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,860
one dan submitted to the bureau,

813
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,420
60 jin to Mr. Jin

814
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,900
and 100 jin to ourselves.

815
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,770
The report was drafted.

816
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,650
It now sits on Mr. Jin's desk.

817
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,820
Who did you offload to

818
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,820
that 100 jin we kept?

819
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,610
Hu again.

820
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,130
His bids always top the market.

821
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,540
Heard Mr. Jin's

822
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,570
also landed with him.

823
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,610
And the one dan to the Bureau

824
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,860
is likely with him, too.

825
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,730
I'm not sure.

826
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,500
Give it a whirl next time.

827
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,730
Morning's booties become

828
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,250
afternoon's inventory at his stall.

829
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,570
Hu wields immense influence?

830
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,770
Come on!

831
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,650
He's got backers!

832
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,170
Hello.

833
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,570
Master.

834
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,060
Yes, I am.

835
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,980
I'm coming.

836
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,460
Mr. Jin summoned me.

837
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,210
Must be your promotion to the chief!

838
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,610
Daydream much!

839
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,420
Though frankly,

840
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,380
it's overdue.

841
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,250
Mr. Mu, let's celebrate when you return!

842
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,250
Come in.

843
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,610
Master, what can I do for you?

844
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,020
Sit.

845
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,860
A chief from the Security Command

846
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,020
just came and said they seized

847
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,820
an opium shipment and stored them
at Warehouse No. 18 on the Bund.

848
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,340
But they were raided

849
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,420
by unidentified attackers days ago.

850
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,460
Warehouse No. 18?

851
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,500
Wasn't that…?

852
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,130
Yes.

853
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,340
The very case you investigated earlier.

854
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,420
After their secret investigation,

855
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,980
they found the opium in Hu's opium den.

856
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,690
Upon interrogation, Hu confessed

857
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,770
that the opium was sold to him

858
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,420
by one of our men.

859
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,500
How should we handle this?

860
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,060
Kill Hu,

861
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,090
so the dead cannot give witness.

862
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,570
Hu is locked up in the Security Command.

863
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,250
To kill him there?

864
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,980
Are you crazy?

865
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,290
Then make someone below the scapegoat

866
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,170
and say that he colluded with Hu.

867
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,090
So at most

868
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,060
we'll be held responsible for oversight.

869
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,980
At this stage, this is the only choice.

870
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,060
Last time,
you crossed the Patrol Office,

871
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,060
and now the Security Command!

872
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,380
Mu Ziru, you promised me

873
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,130
no more reckless stunts!

874
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,130
How long's it been?

875
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,500
Already landed us in this disaster!

876
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,250
Master, I checked ahead.

877
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,420
That shipment belongs to a merchant
from Suzhou.

878
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,340
Unrelated
to the Security Command.

879
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,500
Nonsense.

880
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,340
If you had,

881
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,460
this wouldn't have happened today.

882
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,210
Good-for-nothing!

883
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,980
Master,

884
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,380
I was wrong. I'll be more cautious

885
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,060
and cause no more trouble.

886
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,860
Please give me another chance.

887
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,500
Forget it.

888
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,540
I'll explain to the Security Command

889
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,730
and say it's a misunderstanding.

890
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:38,340
At most, treat them to a banquet.

891
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,900
But return that shipment in full.

892
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,500
Figure this out yourself.

893
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,500
I see.

894
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,380
Give me two days

895
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,540
and I'll replenish

896
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,980
the two dan of opium.

897
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,090
Two dan?

898
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,780
They told me it was 20.
