00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,850
Why bring this up now?

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,500
I need to know the truth.

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,010
The truth is,

38
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,660
Mu Ziru killed him.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,730
But the real culprit was the KMT.

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,410
Five years ago,

41
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,570
the person who called Xia Chu away
while he was trying on his suit

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,410
was you.

43
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,170
What exactly did you tell him?

44
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,260
He rushed off

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,340
without even saying goodbye.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,660
Who told you all this?

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,730
For five years,

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,610
why didn't you ever say a word
about this?

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,380
What are you hiding?

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,500
What are you so afraid of?

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,290
This note was found

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,890
on Xia Chu.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,410
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

54
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,010
Why was your note on Xia Chu?

55
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,340
Why did you tell him
to pick up the medicine?

56
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,140
Mu Ziru told me himself

57
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,140
they went to Kangning Clinic

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,610
to arrest someone else.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,900
But when they got there,

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,810
they found Xia Chu too.

61
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,700
So this note

62
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,540
was the reason Xia Chu was there, right?

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,370
What's your relationship with Lingdang?

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,900
He's a patient. Nothing more.

65
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,810
Without an inside man,

66
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,930
we couldn't have taken out Mu Ziru.

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,700
So that was Lingdang, right?

68
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,850
I figured as much.

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,100
He also benefited from Mu Ziru's death.

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,540
Lingdang was

71
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,900
part of Xia Chu's death, wasn't he?

72
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,490
You sure know how to spin a story.

Spin a story?

74
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,250
Then tell me,

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,930
on the morning of April 12, 1927,

76
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,140
Lingdang showed up

77
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,700
just as Wen's Pharmacy opened.

78
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,050
What was he doing there?

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,580
He was just here to get some medicine.

80
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,610
Really?

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,540
For whom?

82
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,780
For his mother.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,490
His mother committed suicide by drowning

84
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,850
twenty years ago.

85
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,340
Is that so? I didn't know.

86
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,170

87
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,610
I'll say it for you.

88
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,540
He wanted to tell you

89
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,980
he was heading to Kangning Clinic

90
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,020
to arrest CPC members, didn't he?

91
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,540
After that,

92
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,290
you went
to the Western-style tailor shop,

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,610
found Xia Chu,

94
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,370
and told him to pick up the medicine.

95
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,540

Mu Ziru shot him dead.

before the wedding,

188
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,500
so she decided not to get married.

189
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,740
She won't talk about
what really happened.

190
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,820
Wait, she didn't tell you?

191
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,300
You always tell her everything.

192
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,660
Can't blame her for that.

193
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,620
Maybe Wen Zhiqiu

194
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,060
hurt her somehow,

195
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,940
and she's not ready
to talk about it yet.

196
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,260
Maybe she never thought of you

197
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,660
as a real friend.

198
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,780
Is this bag custom-made?

199
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,740
Yes.

200
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,140
Men

201
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,460
are always two-faced.

202
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,380
None of you can be trusted.

203
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,820
Give me the biggest diamond ring.

204
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,540
Okay.

205
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
Not even me?

206
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,460
Maybe today,

207
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,340
but tomorrow?

208
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,140
I wouldn't bet on it.

209
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,540
Bring me the necklace.

210
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,020
So?

211
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,860
How do I look?

212
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,620
Stunning.

213
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,940
I want everything Miss Bai picked out.

214
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,500
No.

215
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,820
What do you mean?

216
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,540
I don't want any of these.

217
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,100
Not a single one?

218
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,660
Yes.

219
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,100
What do you want?

220
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,020
I want you to take me under your wing

221
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,460
and teach me the business.

222
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,980
Learning all that is so tiring.

223
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,540
Whatever you want,

224
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,340
just name it,

225
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,980
and I'll get it for you.

226
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,500
You're only saying that
because you like me.

227
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,140
The day you stop caring,

228
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,020
even a newspaper might feel like
too much to spend on.

229
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,380
I need to be ready

230
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,420
for that day.

231
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,300
Alright.

232
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,820
Then you'd better start saving up

233
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,020
while I still like you.

234
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,420
Learning how to make money

235
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
is way more valuable.

236
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,660
You're a lot more interesting
than I expected.

237
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,740
And if you keep teaching me,

238
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,060
I might just surprise you even more.

239
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,420
Alright.

240
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,300
Here's your first lesson.

241
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,820
In business,

242
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,740
never trust anyone

243
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,220
but yourself.

244
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,380
Everything else can be an illusion.

245
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,700
Money's the only thing

246
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,180
that's real.

247
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,420
Cheng Hui.

248
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,620
Shaohua.

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,020
Shaohua.

250
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,820
Shaohua.

251
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,580
You've gotten taller.

252
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,940
And you seem to have matured.

253
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,820
Shaohua.

254
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,860
This is my pharmacy certificate.

255
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,620
Here's my chemistry qualification.

256
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,020
And this one is for my patent.

257
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,460
Shaohua, I didn't let you down.

258
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,180
I've been waiting for you.

259
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,180
This used to be a flour mill,

260
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,340
but due to poor management,

261
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,660
it went out of business three years ago.

262
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,300
If we convert it
into a pharmaceutical factory,

263
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,300
the building's structure can stay,

264
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,140
but we'll need to replace

265
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,620
all the partitioning, renovation,
and equipment.

266
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,020
Certainly.

267
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,020
This area can be converted

268
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,420
into a full herbal processing zone,
with a storage room,

269
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,380
a sorting room,

270
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,580
a slicing room,

271
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,580
a processing room,

272
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,980
a testing room,

273
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,100
and a packaging room.

274
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,740
Those sections in the back

275
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,020
can be turned into laboratories
and R&D rooms.

276
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,180
How much

277
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,420
will the entire reconstruction cost?

278
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
Based on this scale?

279
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,540
Yes.

280
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,540
We're building a pharmaceutical factory

281
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,420
that can truly achieve
Western-style processing of TCM.

282
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,540
We'll need
a full set of chemical instruments,

283
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,340
including specialized equipment
of all scales, from abroad,

284
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,180
and they have to be the latest models.

285
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,500
We'll also need a distillation machine,

286
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,500
a salve dryer, a powder grinder,

287
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,300
two pill-making machines,

288
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,420
a steam-powered decoction furnace,

289
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,060
a medicine cauldron, a slicing machine,

290
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,020
and some electronic equipment.

291
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,500
We'll need
at least 600,000 silver dollars.

292
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,060
That much?

293
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,940
That doesn't even include
labor costs for chemistry experts,

294
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,820
pharmacists, engineers,

295
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,540
administrative assistants,

296
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,020
and clerks.

297
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,660
But I only have

298
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,300
a bit over 100,000 right now.

299
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,740
Selling the house

300
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,300
might get us to 200,000.

301
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,060
That's fine.

302
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,940
We'll borrow the rest

303
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,060
from the bank.

304
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Most factories overseas
are using this method now.

305
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,900
Back in the day,

306
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,540
all I needed
was a few dozen silver dollars

307
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,020
to get
tens of thousands of deals moving.

308
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,300
But that's no longer possible.

309
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,980
I can only get a little over 100,000
from the banks these days,

310
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,060
and the interest rates are insane.

311
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,620
If we don't use the latest equipment,

312
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,660
we could cut costs by at least a third.

313
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,100
No.

314
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,700
If we're going to do this,
it has to be the most modern one.

315
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,820
Then there's only one last way.

316
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,980
What way?

317
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,460
Shaohua,

318
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,100
you hold shares
in Wen's Pharmacy, don't you?

319
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Based on its current market value,

320
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,740
they should be worth
over a million silver dollars.

321
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,420
Under my agreement with him,

322
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,740
he holds the right of first refusal.

323
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,580
If I want to sell those shares,

324
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,300
I have to talk to him.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,540
But I don't want to see him again.

326
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,740
Shaohua,

327
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,700
what happened

328
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,060
between you and Mr. Wen?

329
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,100
You were still best friends

330
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,700
when I went abroad four years ago.

331
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,740
How come you don't even

332
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,780
want to say his name now?

333
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,020
Let's drop it.

334
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,820
No, I have to say this.

335
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,660
I know better than anyone

336
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,860
what you two went through.

337
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,900
You started a business, struggled,

338
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,180
and survived
life-or-death situations together.

339
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,940
You didn't

340
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,660
just weather storms together.

341
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,260
You stood by each other
with unshakable loyalty.

342
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,980
You trusted each other with your lives.

343
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,980
So no matter how big the issue is,

344
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,460
you should still be able
to talk it through.

345
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,140
Cheng Hui,

346
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,700
believe me.

347
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,500
If I've decided
to cut all ties with him,

348
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,580
I must have a good reason.

349
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,620
Alright.

350
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,500
So, are we still building

351
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
the factory?

352
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,580
I need you to go talk to him

353
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,220
about the shares in Wen's Pharmacy.

354
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,300
Okay.

355
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,980
Time really flies.

356
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,420
How have you been since you got back?

357
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,420
Pretty well.

358
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,980
How about her?

359
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,740
Not so well.

360
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,660
What exactly happened between you two?

361
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,820
Is there anything I can do for you?

362
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,860
Alright.

363
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,340
By the way,

364
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,500
I'll repurchase her shares

365
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,100
for 600,000 silver dollars.

366
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,300
Really?

367
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,620
You're overpaying by about 50%.

368
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Is it that much?

369
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,540
I'm starting to suspect

370
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,460
that you might have done something

371
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,620
to hurt Shaohua.

372
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,540
You can think of it that way.

373
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,660
Okay, I'll go prepare the contract.

374
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,300
Cheng Hui,

375
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,740
there's another condition

376
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,980
for you.

377
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,300
Tell me.

378
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,260
If she runs into any trouble,

379
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,220
let me know right away.

380
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
You just got this place,

381
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,740
and things seem pretty good.

382
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,700
Why sell it now?

383
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,780
I'm opening a factory and an apothecary,

384
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,820
and need more funds to make it happen.

385
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:03,940
Thank you.

386
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,700
How much do you need? I'll cover it.

387
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,380
I can't take your money.

388
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,860
Why not?

389
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,660
I know things haven't been easy for you.

390
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,900
Your restaurant was bombed

391
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,740
and all your savings
were wiped out, weren't they?

392
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,020
That bit of money you have

393
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,820
won't even make a dent in what I need.

394
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,300
You should hold on to it.

395
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,660
Alright.

396
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,980
By the way,

397
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,660
what's going on
between you and Xia Yuan?

398
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm his secretary and assistant.

399
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,500
Just that?

400
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,260
Of course not.

401
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,620
He's married.

402
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,620
It's pretty common for men

403
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,060
to juggle more than one relationship.

404
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,220
But you don't need to belittle yourself.

405
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,980
Would you think less of me

406
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,460
just because I'm his mistress?

407
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,620
I just feel it's not worth it for you.

408
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,820
I know what I'm doing.

409
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,380
Erniu, I think...

410
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Don't worry.

411
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,100
I know what I want,

412
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,500
and I will get it.

413
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,340
Money?

414
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,020
Didn't you say

415
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,260
you wanted to make your own money?

416
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,100
That's exactly why

417
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,180
I need to be with Xia Yuan.

418
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,860
I want to learn
how to do business from him.

419
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,980
Why don't you

420
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,260
just follow me instead?

421
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,940
I knew you'd say that.

422
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,220
If I'm going to learn from someone,

423
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,580
I might as well pick
someone with real experience.

424
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,180
Xia Yuan's been in the game
longer than you.

425
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,340
I'd be better off
learning from him than from you.

426
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,900
But I have to warn you,

427
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,780
Xia Yuan's the kind of man

428
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,260
who'll throw anything aside for money.

429
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm afraid he'll lead you astray.

430
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:57,980
Funny thing is,

431
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,380
I'm the kind of woman

432
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,060
who'd do the same.

433
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,620
Besides,

434
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,900
I'm already this messed up.

435
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,060
How much worse could he really make me?

436
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,980
Erniu,

437
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,420
aren't you paying a higher price

438
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,820
for this relationship

439
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,740
than any of your others?

440
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,700
This time,

441
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,860
I'll walk away
with more than I ever have.

442
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,100
There's someone you need to see.

443
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,020
Who?

444
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,420
Coming through.

445
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,340
I heard she got all her savings

446
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,060
swindled away.

447
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,020
She couldn't keep her hands to herself,

448
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,100
so Mr. Tian threw her out.

449
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,620
She then started a small business

450
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,420
and just lost it all again.

451
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,660
Thank you.

452
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,260
Bao, I've got some money.

453
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,780
How about I send you overseas
for school?

454
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,620
Shaozhong,

455
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,580
we've earned a bit.

456
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,300
Let's treat ourselves
to some pig's head meat

457
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,420
and a pork hock.

458
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,300
- Great!
- Wonderful!

[Chichun Apothecary]

460
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,100
- Splendid!
- Awesome!

461
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,220
[Huashun Apothecary]

462
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,700
Hello everyone.

463
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,780
Shaohua.

464
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,820
Miss Bai.

465
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,340
On behalf of Mr. Xia Yuan,
Chairman of Shouyuan Apothecary

466
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
and Jujing Apothecary,

467
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,380
I extend my congratulations
to Ms. Chu Shaohua,

468
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,900
Chairwoman
of Chichun Apothecary Co., Ltd.

469
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,940
and Director of Shaohua Pharmaceuticals.

470
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,020
- Good!
- Great!

471
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,620
I'm so thrilled for you.

472
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,540
Congratulations.

473
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,140
You've finally made your dream
come true.

474
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,620
Honestly, I couldn't be happier.

475
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,300
Miss Chu,

476
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,060
Mr. Wen asked me to congratulate you

477
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,860
on your new store and factory launch

478
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,860
and to wish you
great success and prosperity.

479
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,780
Xue,

480
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,420
thank you.

481
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,940
But you should take
this flower basket back.

482
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,060
Come here.

483
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,460
Wen's Pharmacy and I

484
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,180
parted ways long ago.

485
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,700
I've broken things off

486
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,420
with your boss.

487
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,420
I don't need his congratulations,

488
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,780
nor his blessings.

489
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,620
So please,

490
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,980
take it back.

491
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,060
Thank you.

492
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,340
Miss Chu,

493
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,180
please give us a tour of your factory.

494
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,260
I heard it is

495
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
the most advanced in Shanghai.

496
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,540
That's why

497
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,180
we came.

498
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,700
Yes.

499
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,260
That's right.

500
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,340
I'll show you
around the factory in just a bit.

501
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,420
But you've been waiting here
for so long

502
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
and must be thirsty.

503
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,700
Please come in and have some tea.

504
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
- Okay.
- Please.

505
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:53,620
Thank you.

506
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,900
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

507
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,660
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

508
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,980
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

509
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,580
You sent the flower basket back?

510
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,900
Isn't that a bit harsh?

511
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,660
He and I are already strangers.

512
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,940
How does that make me heartless?

513
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,740
Thank you.

514
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,620
Everyone,

515
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,820
our philosophy

516
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,580
is to scientifically refine
and improve TCM.

517
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,340
Using our latest mechanical methods

518
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,500
to purify and extract TCM,

519
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,940
we reprocess TCM in the style

520
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,340
of Western medicine manufacturing.

521
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,820
And these are

522
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,020
our upcoming products,

523
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,980
concentrated TCM pills,

524
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,260
officially named Miracle Pills.

525
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,700
Mechanical purification and extraction?

526
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,620
What does that mean?

527
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,540
For the technical side of things,

528
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,980
I'll defer to our chief engineer,

529
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,140
Mr. Cheng Hui.

530
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,380
He's also the inventor
behind this patent.

531
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,740
Everyone, let me show you the equipment.

532
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,740
This equipment

533
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,180
consists of a base...

534
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,580
Shaohua,

535
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,580
these must have cost a lot.

536
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,940
The equipment and the building

537
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,060
cost a total of 720,000 silver dollars.

538
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,180
If you add Chichun Apothecary?

539
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,500
It's around 800,000.

540
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,180
You must be loaded.

541
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,220
It wasn't enough at first,

542
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,380
but he offered 600,000 silver dollars

543
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,860
to buy back my shares in Wen's Pharmacy.

544
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,980
Also,

545
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,420
my house

546
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,060
was worth just 40,000,

547
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,380
but I managed to sell it for 80,000.

548
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,900
Just enough to cover it all.

549
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,340
All 600,000 came from Wen Zhiqiu?

550
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,540
No wonder.

551
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,900
What?

552
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,180
You don't know, do you?

553
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,180
Wen Zhiqiu sold

554
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,140
all of Wen's Pharmacy's branches
in Shanghai,

555
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,980
even the profitable ones

556
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,740
on Jing'an Temple Road and Hubei Road.

557
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,100
He only kept the main store.

558
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,660
Everyone was wondering why.

559
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,940
Now it makes sense.

560
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,620
It was all to buy your shares.

561
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
He sold all the branches?

562
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,940
Ever since he broke up with you,

563
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,700
he's been acting pretty strange.

564
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,580
He sold his shops in Shanghai,

565
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,780
then opened branches
in Hong Kong, China, Shantou,

566
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,460
and Sanheba.

567
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,980
I even heard he plans

568
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,900
to expand to Dapu, Yongding,

569
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,980
Shanghang, and Tingzhou.

570
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,860
Isn't that just ridiculous?

571
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,980
Mr. Wen, she won't accept it.

572
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,300

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,500
I heard

592
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,860
Shaohua's updated the ancient recipe

593
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,100
and even used mechanical purification
and extraction technology.

594
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,020
Seems it works better than ever.

595
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,340
Where'd she get the money

596
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,700
for such a massive factory?

597
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,300
Wen Zhiqiu

598
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,700
bought back her shares at a steep price.

599
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,700
I knew it.

600
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,500
He still has feelings

601
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,700
for Chu Shaohua.

602
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,860
Shaohua returned

603
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,340
the flower basket he sent.

604
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,620
That's something she would do.

605
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
I'd say

606
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,340
Chu Shaohua is more of a go-getter
than Wen Zhiqiu.

607
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,300
Where did Wen Zhiqiu

608
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,020
mess up this time?

609
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,420
He's totally finished.

610
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,140
He used to be really smart.

611
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,060
His pharmacy ranked
among the top three in Shanghai.

612
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,020
He made a mess of himself

613
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
and his business fell to pieces

614
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,100
over that relationship.

615
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,900
So listen up,

616
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,380
in business,

617
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,860
you can't let emotions get in the way.

618
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,100
Wen Zhiqiu is a cautionary tale.

619
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
Got it.

620
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,580
This is the new drug
I'm launching next month.

fully in charge.

623
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,140
You've been under my wing
for a while now.

624
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,100
Let's see what you've learned.

625
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,100
Okay.

626
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm going to give it a try.

627
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,860
Try?

628
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,060
From this moment on, every move you make

629
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,060
has to be all or nothing.

630
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,300
Burn the boats.

631
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,940
I understand.

632
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,860
And let me remind you.

633
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,980
Its direct competitor

634
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,260
is Miracle Pill.

635
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,780
You're asking me
to go up against Shaohua?

636
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,420
That's right.

637
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,100
No.

638
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,620
Is there another option I can try?

639
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,620
What's wrong?

640
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,660
Are you afraid you can't beat her?

641
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,420
No.

642
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,940
I'm afraid this is going

643
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,140
to affect my friendship with Shaohua.

644
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,660
Look at you.

645
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,940
I just told you

646
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,020
to keep your emotions out of it.

647
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,100
And you're letting your feelings
cloud your judgment once again.

648
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,540
But it's Shaohua.

649
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,900
Let me put it this way.

650
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,580
Once your interests clash,

651
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,300
even if you show mercy,

652
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,140
Chu Shaohua won't back down.

653
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,020
She wouldn't do that.

654
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:04,980
Really?

655
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,460
The way she treats Wen Zhiqiu now

656
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,140
is

657
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,380
how she'll treat you down the line.

658
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,620
So,

659
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,660
business and personal feelings

660
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,140
should remain separate.

661
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,860
You really need

662
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,340
to learn from Chu Shaohua on this.

663
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,900
And you know what, darling?

664
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,860
The only thing

665
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,980
that's pure in my world

666
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,100
is money.

667
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,140
So pure that it leaves no room
for distractions,

668
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,660
not even emotions.

669
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,020
If you

670
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,660
want to make big money,

671
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,940
you'll have to let go

672
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,380
of a lot of emotional ties.

673
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,900
If it were someone else,
it would be fine.

674
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,500
But if it's Shaohua we're talking about,

675
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,820
I don't think I stand a chance.

676
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,540
Don't be afraid, darling.

677
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,540
Think about it.

678
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,340
Who's got your back?

684
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,100
go all in and make it count.

685

That's how you truly show respect
for your opponent.

686
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,540
Okay.

687
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,860

Why are you back?

692
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,980
Didn't you join the army?

693
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,300
How did you make it back so soon?

694
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,540
I joined the army

695
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,740
to fight the Japanese.

696
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,820
But they sent us to Jiangxi

697
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,540
to go after the Chinese Communists.

698
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,700
I can't bring myself

716
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,300
Xia Yuan?

717
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,380
I didn't expect it either.

00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,820
why would you do this to yourself?

720

I couldn't help myself.

721
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,300
Couldn't help yourself?

722
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,500
You had a choice.

723
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,980
You're perfectly capable
of making your own money,

724
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,300
so why rely on men?

725
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,460
What's wrong with that?

726
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,900
Depending on men
is a kind of strength too.

727
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,500
You really are pathetic.

728
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,100
I don't care.

729
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,180

how could you turn out like this?

That's just who I am.

732
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,900
I'm shameless.

733
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,660
Yes, I rely on men.

734
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,260
So what?

735
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,340
What gives you the right to judge me?

736

Where were you when I needed you?

barely clinging to life.

740
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,820
Where were you then?

I was serving our country!

As a soldier,

745
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,380
you failed to protect the nation.

746
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,300
As a man,

747
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,740
you failed to protect
the woman you love.

748
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,220
And you still look down on me?

749
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,860
You're in no position to judge!

750
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,060
[Shanghai Shaohua Pharmaceuticals]

751
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,580
What's going on?

752
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,900
Miracle Pill

753
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,660
has met a serious challenger.

754
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,660
What is it?

755
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,500
Jujing Apothecary
just introduced the Yushu Pill.

756
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,700
Its ingredients are similar
to Miracle Pill.

757
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,420
We ran tests.

758
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,340
Its efficacy is far inferior,

759
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,060
but its sales are ten times higher.

760
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,900
Our sales

761
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,020
have taken a big hit because of this.

762
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,500
Tell me how they did it.

763
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,980
Their pricing is lower than ours.

764
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,620
And the rebates and payment terms
they offer to apothecaries

765
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,340
are extremely generous.

766
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,940
If it were just those two things,

767
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,580
we wouldn't be afraid to compete.

768
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,020
But what's truly infuriating

769
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,900
is that they're throwing
huge sums of money around,

770
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,420
locking in exclusive deals
with apothecaries.

771
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,140
Selling Yushu means
Miracle Pill is out of the picture.

772
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,900
But how is this strategy
making them any money?

773
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,780
They don't care about making money.

774
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,100
They just want to crush us.

775
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,500
I heard that this wasn't
even Xia Yuan's idea.

776
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,740
It's

777
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,500
a Miss Bai.

778
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,260
A cup of coffee, please.

779
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,860
Miss Bai.

780
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,900
Ms. Chu.

781
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,100
What's the rush

782
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,540
to see me?

783
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,780
Yushu Pill

784
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,940
has been a big hit lately.

785
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,660
I heard.

786
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,900
You're good.

787
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,740
You're trying to put me
out of business, aren't you?

788
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:22,860
Thank you.

789
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,300
Not really.

790
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,020
This is my first performance report

791
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,500
since joining Jujing Apothecary.

792
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,540
Guess I just went a little overboard.

793
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,980
Did Xia Yuan tell you to do this?

794
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,140
It was also my idea.

795
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,700
Aren't you worried

796
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,420
this might hurt our friendship?

797
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,700
I was, at first.

798
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,500
But then I realized

799
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,540
business and personal feelings

800
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,620
should stay separate.

801
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,020
Did Xia Yuan teach you that too?
