00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,650
Seems it's your wife.

194
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,650
Those shameless women!

195
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,460
They disgraced themselves
at the newspaper offices,

196
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,490
and now came here to cause a scene.

197
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,220
Step aside!

198
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,850
You vixen! Vixen!

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,980
Vixen!

200
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,770
Seize her! Don't let her escape!

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,340
Vixen! Grab her!

202
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,580
She's running away!

203
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,060
She's escaping!

204
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,370
Don't stop us!

205
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,220
Darling.

206
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,220
Catch her!

207
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,460
Behave yourself.

208
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,730
Don't let her escape!

209
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,730
Drive them out!

210
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,420
Chase them away!

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,060
Come out here!

212
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,610
Vixen, don't hide in there!

213
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,340
Come out!

214
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,650
Don't hide inside!

215
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,940
Come out now!

216
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,100
Come out!

217
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,100
Open the door!

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,610
Come out!

219
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,980
What do you want to do?

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,180
How ruthless!

221
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,770
Explain this to me now!

222
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,370
Who on earth is this vixen?

223
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,250
What is she?

224
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,300
Hand her over now.

225
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,490
Come out now!

226
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,130
Murder!

227
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,820
That's terrifying!

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,060
He is dead!

229
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,250
Nobody moves!

230
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,060
Stay put!

231
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,650
Go back. Don't leave.

232
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,730
All go back.

233
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,420
Move back.

234
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,770
No one leaves.

235
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,980
Head back.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,250
Move back.

237
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,980
Shaohua,

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,530
go with me.

239
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,770
No one leaves.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,460
Go back.

241
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,940
Do not move.

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,610
Go back.

243
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,060
There is a murder.

244
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,250
Get in the car.

245
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
[Rongshun Hotel]

246
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,460
Mr. Xia,

247
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,130
thanks to your resourcefulness,

248
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,250
or I wouldn't have escaped.

249
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,300
My deepest gratitude.

250
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,980
Ms. Chu, you're too kind.

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,130
Firstly, as an old friend

252
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,650
and Wen's Pharmacy's shareholder,

253
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,220
I wouldn't just sit idly by.

254
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,730
Secondly,

255
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,370
given your sharp intellect

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,610
and connection with Mr. Lu,

257
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,100
you'd escape

258
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,460
even without my intervention.

259
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,650
Cheers.

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,650
Erniu,

261
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,220
thanks go out to you. too.

262
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,890
Without you,

263
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,010
we'd be sunk.

264
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,180
I truly did nothing!

265
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,650
Just happened to overhear

266
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,530
he would meet you at the hot springs.

267
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,580
By chance,

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,460
I saw his sixth concubine
at the department store.

269
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,370
Over coffee with her,

270
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,650
your secret slipped out

271
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,180
unintentionally.

272
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,220
By accident,

273
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,060
knocked over their jealousy flask.

274
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,850
Alright then.

275
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,250
Here is

276
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,530
to these coincidences.

277
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,100
Cheers.

278
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,180
Nearly overlooked you!

279
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,300
Here, Mr. Wen.

280
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,610
Let's skip the small talk.

281
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,610
It's all in the drink now.

282
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,330
Say something,

283
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,180
like "my deepest thanks to Mr. Wen",

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,260
"exemplifying grace under fire",

285
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,540
"masterful crisis management",

286
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,380
and "turning the tide".

287
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,300
No!

288
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,380
Too cheesy for my taste.

289
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,610
Come on, let's toast!

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,570
Mr. Xia, tuck into this feast.

291
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,570
Alright.

292
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,210
Oh, where's Wang?

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,900
All sorted. He'll be well taken care of.

294
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,490
Perfect.

295
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,180
Mr. Xia, what are your hobbies?

296
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,450
I have not many,

297
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,090
just one obsession,

298
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,330
making money.

299
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,570
How fortuitous!

300
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,020
That's precisely mine, too.

301
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,610
Then we must drink to that!

302
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,450
Let's toast to our shared hobby.

303
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,610
Oh, you're bleeding!

304
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,570
I think I have a clean handkerchief
in my bag.

305
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,180
No, don't trouble yourself.

306
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,300
Any hemostatic gauze?

307
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,730
Yes.

308
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,330
Could you fetch some?

309
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,780
Alright.

310
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,090
Here you are.

311
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,090
No need. It's stopped now.

312
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,660
Very well.

313
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,140
Is the pain gone now?

314
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,380
Yes.

315
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,610
Thank you, Miss Bai.

316
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:42,940
No problem.

317
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,020
I'm well-versed in handling

318
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,210
these minor cuts.

319
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,420
Mr. Xia.

320
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,020
Thanks.

321
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,540
Boss, just received word.

322
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,690
Mr. Lu's cousin

323
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,180
has been appointed Chief of Police.

324
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,020
Our shipment will be fully dispatched
this week.

325
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,090
Come,

326
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,330
let's raise the glass.

327
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,610
What's the occasion for such cheer?

328
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,060
Just received word.

329
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,850
Mr. Lu's cousin

330
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,180
has been appointed Chief
of Songhu Police Department.

331
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,300
After investigation,

332
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,300
Wen's Pharmacy cleared of violations.

333
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,260
All goods will be returned
within a week.

334
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,700
This calls for a toast!

335
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,620
Evildoers meet their just end.

336
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,740
Worth celebrating.

337
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,860
Got my own good news, too.

338
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,740
What is it?

339
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,020
My new film is set hit theaters
next week!

340
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,900
Another reason to drink up!

341
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,620
- Come on!
- Cheers

342
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,740
Mr. Wen, go upstairs to have some water.

343
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Alright.

344
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
I'll take this up for you.

345
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,460
No need.

346
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,540
You've been pushing yourself lately.

347
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,020
Should get proper rest.

348
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm fine!

349
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:14,940
You're exhausted.

350
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,820
Fine, if you insist.

351
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,980
Take these with you.

352
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,580
But they're not mine.

353
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,380
When you stayed at my place,

354
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,340
I bought them.

355
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,220
Since you're leaving now,

356
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,220
I can't eat all this alone.

357
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,780
Take it. Don't let it go to waste.

358
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,060
Don't worry about that.

359
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,980
Thanks. We won't stand on ceremony.

360
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,100
Thanks.

361
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,740
Just a moment.

362
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,500
Your late-night coughing irritated me.

363
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
As a herb dealer,

364
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,700
you should take care.

365
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,690
Thanks!

366
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,730
Oh, I should thank you!

367
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,010
Now that you're gone,

368
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,250
my free and quiet life returns.

369
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,100
Congratulations!

370
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,340
Bye-bye!

371
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,340
Bye-bye!

372
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,660
You lived together for so many days,

373
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,460
yet nothing happened?

374
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,940
Countless fights.

375
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Living side by side like that,

376
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,380
haven't you developed feelings for him?

377
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,570
Feelings?

378
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,180
I nearly hit him!

379
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,900
But mark my words.

380
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,380
He absolutely fell for you.

381
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,250
He'd never fall for anyone.

382
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,900
Shaohua,

383
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,180
don't you think he's got eyes for you?

384
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,730
Yeah, he has.

385
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,490
Really?

386
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,290
For my ability to make money.

387
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,290
Fine.

388
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,980
Let's go in.

389
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,660
Finally home.

390
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,250
You're amazing in every aspect.

391
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,660
Look! You can cook.

392
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,860
Also, you're attentive

393
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,980
and know how to do business.

394
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,770
Haven't you thought

395
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,860
about giving someone a chance?

396
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,570
You can sleep in this room.

397
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,860
New sheet, duvet cover and pillow.

398
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,860
Where will you sleep?

399
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,380
Right next to you.

400
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,380
On that sofa.

401
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,250
Can't you just spit it out all at once?

402
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,380
Boss,

403
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,180
Qiao's back from Peking.

404
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,980
Send him in.

405
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,660
Boss.

406
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,980
Have you found Lu Ningxiang?

407
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,250
I tracked down Linfang Pavilion,

408
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,490
the madam from back then,

409
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,530
and even Wu,

410
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,050
the man who sold her there.

411
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,500
Have you found

412
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,850
all her distant relatives?

413
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,420
Quit stalling!

414
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,570
Give me what matters!

415
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,660
Tell me if you've found Lu Ningxiang.

416
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,620
No.

417
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,500
Then how dare you come back?

418
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,980
Why didn't you just slam

419
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,580
into a tofu block halfway?

420
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,540
Bend over the desk!

421
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,060
Stay down!

422
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,780
I told you to stay down.

423
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
Boss, one more thing.

424
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,300
Go ahead.

425
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,700
I failed to find Lu Ningxiang,

426
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,180
but I found something else.

427
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,660
Spill it.

428
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,660
Five years ago,

429
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Lu Ningxiang left Linfang Pavilion.

430
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,940
It was said that a Mrs. Chen

431
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,780
bought her freedom.

432
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,540
And the real name of that Mrs. Chen

433
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,380
is Chu Shaohua.

434
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,180
[The End]

435
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,300
Thank you all for being here.

436
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,580
I'm sure
everyone has different feelings.

437
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,940
Now, let's open the floor

438
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,060
for our media friends,

439
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,900
reporters, and audience members.

440
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,500
Feel free to ask

441
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
our cast

442
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,860
and the director

443
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,740
and connect up close.

444
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,580
Mr. Zhang,

445
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,740
why are you making this film?

446
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,540
Our creative vision

447
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,340
is to inspire all women

448
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,820
to emulate our heroine
to boldly break free

449
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,180
from the constraints
of family and society,

450
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,540
and pursue their own happiness.

451
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,060
Miss Liang Shanshan,

452
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,530
how does this role differ

453
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,010
from your previous ones?

454
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
In Rage Reborn,

455
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,920
I play the heroine, Li Xiuhua.

456
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,240
She's an independent woman,

457
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,270
a true role model for us all.

458
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,310
I have a question

459
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,530
for Miss Bai Bingxin!

460
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,530
No,

461
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,240
I should call you Miss Lu Ningxiang.

462
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,200
Sir,

463
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,510
aren't you mistaken?

464
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,720
Miss Bai Bingxin plays

465
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,880
Li Xiuxiang in the film.

466
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,960
I didn't make a mistake!

467
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,240
That was her name

468
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,750
while she entertained clients

469
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,000
at Linfang Pavilion in Peking!

470
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,920
Entertained clients?

[Premiere of Rage Reborn]

472
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,340
Don't talk nonsense.

473
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,300
Lu Ningxiang,

474
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,540
when did you

475
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,180
change your name to Bai Bingxin?

476
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Stop spreading lies!

477
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,140
Yeah!

478
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
When did you change it?

479
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,500
Tell us.

480
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,060
Today marks

481
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,140
the premiere of Rage Reborn.

482
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,140
Let's keep our focus on the film.

483
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,380
Miss Liang Shanshan,

484
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,220
what's your similarity with the role?

485
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,260
There are many.

486
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,780
I...

487
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,580
Lu Ningxiang!

488
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,180
You wretch sold your body.

489
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,300
Even if you turn into ashes,
I'll recognize you.

490
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,420
Lu Ningxiang!

491
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,460
Kang Erniu!

492
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,340
All this is your fault!

493
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,180
Lu Ningxiang!

494
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,620
You wretch sold your body.

495
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,340
Even if you turn into ashes,
I'll recognize you.

496
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,140
Back then in Peking,

497
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,700
we could touch you
with eight copper coins

498
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,700
and make you strip off with 15.

499
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,660
Ziru,

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,220

501
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,340
- Reporters.
- Never expected

502
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,740
that you're a film star now.

503
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,500
Lu Ningxiang,

504
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,100
do you still remember him?

505
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,380
Don't push.

506
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,180
Take photos!

507
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,780
Lu Ningxiang, you wretch sold your body.

508
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,700
Even if you turn to ashes,
I'll recognize you.

509
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,300
Back then in Peking,

510
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,900
we could touch you
with eight copper coins

511
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,620
and make you strip off with 15.

512
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,260
Lu Ningxiang,

513
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,820
do you have anything left to say?

514
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,780
Lu Ningxiang!

515
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,380
Can you share with us?

516
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,220
Lu Ningxiang!

517
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,420
Just tell us already!

518
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,700
Come on.

519
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,620
Lu Ningxiang!

520
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,620
Is it true?

521
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,100
Speak up!

522
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,260
Lu Ningxiang!

523
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,740
Don't go!

524
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,420
You wretch!

525
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,420
Wretch!

526
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,780
Lu Ningxiang!

527
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,100
Lu Ningxiang!

528
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,900
You wretch sold your body.

529
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,300
We could touch you
with eight copper coins.

530
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,980
Even if you turn to ashes,
I'll recognize you.

531
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,340
You prostitute!

532
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,580
Bai.

533
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,540
Hasn't returned yet?

534
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,620
No.

535
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,940
I went to the film company

536
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,380
and asked her close colleagues.

537
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,620
None got news of her.

538
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,260
I've checked everywhere

539
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,380
she used to hang out.

540
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,420
No one has seen her.

541
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,020
The landlady said she never came back.

542
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,660
Where could she possibly be?

543
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,420
I just checked.

544
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,580
She didn't take anything with her.

545
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,820
Her money is still sitting there.

546
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,340
She must not have gone far.

547
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,580
Mu Ziru?

548
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,180
Could she have gone to him?

549
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,780
I've called him,

550
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,580
but no answer.

551
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,660
I asked his men

552
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,820
and none has seen her.

553
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
No sense of responsibility!

554
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,500
Any news?

555
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,020
We've searched every possible place.

556
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,740
Could she have gone back home?

557
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,860
Impossible!

558
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,620
With what I know about her,

559
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,540
she'd rather die than go back.

560
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,660
I think she's in Shanghai.

561
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,740
Any photos of her?

562
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,500
I'll ask Mr. Xia

563
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,100
to make his staff join the search.

564
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,500
I'll check the train station and docks.

565
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,260
I'll also ask around my circle

566
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,020
to see if there are any new leads.

567
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,540
Got it.

568
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,500
Whether there's news or not,

569
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,500
we'll all meet back here

570
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,820
at 10:00 PM tonight.

571
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,460
Got it.

572
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,260
Also,

573
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
Mu Ziru has many subordinates.

574

Those who hurt you are dirty.

They deserve public condemnation

816

and legal punishment.

817
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
You owe no self-blame
