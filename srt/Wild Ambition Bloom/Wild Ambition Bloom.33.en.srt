31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,260
This leaves us with only two choices.

32

Surrender to him now

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,380
or

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,380
surrender to him before bankruptcy.

35
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,570
Will you?

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,330
Here's my idea.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,900
If it comes up heads,

38
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,930
you'll hunt for supplies;

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,210
I'll convince customers

40
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,380

you'll convince the customers.

44

Go ahead.

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,220
Given the changed situation,

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,820
could we delay delivering the goods?

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,060
Absolutely not.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,010

Ms. Chu,

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,220
we've run out of the raw herbs you want.

53
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,100
Let alone a whole bag,

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,660
I couldn't even produce a single stick.

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,500
If you don't believe, look around.

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
Mr. Yu, by how things stand now,

57
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,450
it's hard to fulfill this order.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,500
Then compensate.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,340
Sure, we will.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,100
But could we reduce the amount?

61
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,220
No.

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,060
Compensate based on those figures

63
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,290
in the contract.

64
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,780
It'll drive us

65
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,850
straight into bankruptcy!

66
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,500
None of my business.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,130
I can't help.

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,340
We could offer higher prices.

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,820
Let me be frank.

70
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,060
Even if you increase the offer,

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,340
I simply cannot sell to you.

72
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,100

73
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,220
Mr. Xia...

74
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,610
I see.

75
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,340
I've checked with every herbal supplier

76
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,500
in Shanghai and the surrounding areas.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,130
Some have no stock left.

78
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,730
As to those with inventory,

79
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,010
some are controlled by Xia Yuan,

80
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,660
and some store their goods too far away

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,450
to deliver before the Chinese New Year.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,660
Our customers have the same demands.

83
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,410
Either deliver on time

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,260
or compensate.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,290
Seems we must pay the penalties.

86
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,610
But we don't have funds.

87
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,250
My house and your car

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,610

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,700
So

91
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,220
are we going to sell

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,020
our brand?

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,370

Not true.

104
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,730
I've also heard

105
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,370
Xia Yuan cut off your raw herbs supply,

106
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,490
so you can't fulfill existing orders

107
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,900
and have to compensate your customers.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,250
Mr. Tian,

109
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,490
he is also our shareholder!

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,700
Would he do that to harm

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,660
everyone involved?

112
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,610
Stubborn!

113
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,290
Did you call us here today

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,980
for anything else?

115
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,580
Let me be blunt.

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,730
For the rare herbs
you're desperately seeking,

117
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,250

118
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,850
Stop boasting!

119
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,660
Don't believe me?

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,100
No supplier in Jiangsu and Zhejiang

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,410
had stock left.

122
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,340
What if I do have some?

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,100
Let it be.

124
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,140
None of our business.

125
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,460
Are you selling it to us?

126
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,220
Who knows?

127
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,820
Even if you are,

128
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,050
we won't buy from you.

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,970
Why?

130
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,780
Shaohua.

131
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,170
Don't be fooled.

132
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,170
He has no stock, just fooling us!

133
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,370
Even if we assume

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,930
he does have stock,

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,530
would he sell that to us?

136
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,900
He wants us to be crushed by Xia Yuan.

137
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,260
I'm selling it!

138
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,700
But I won't buy!

139
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,460
Shut your mouth!

140
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,660
Mr. Tian,

141
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,100
do you intend to sell those herbs

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,050
to us?

143
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,820
Exactly!

144
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,220
But at five times the market rate.

145
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,850
What? Five times?

146
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,370
Why don't you just rob a bank?

147
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,140
If I do, cops will arrest me.

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,100
But if I rob you,
they won't lift a finger!

149
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,100
Besides,

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,170
to rob a bank will bring me only cash.

151
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,460
But to rob you will bring me cash

152
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,100
and annoy Xia Yuan!

153
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,700
Happy to just think about it.

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,900
Wen Zhiqiu,

155
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,050
let alone the fivefold price,

156
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,730
even if he offers them for free,

157
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,660
we must not accept.

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,490
But

159
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,970
if we can't secure the raw herbs now,

160
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,020
we'll go broke.

161
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,340
I'd rather go broke.

162
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,020
Then Xia Yuan will get what he wants.

163
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,260
Precisely!

164
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,930
After all,

165
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,970
traitor Xia Yuan

166
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,610
is far more hateful than me.

167
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,410
You're despicable, no better!

168
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,460
You schemer!

169
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,490
Two of a kind!

170
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,050

171
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,340
Today, I'll succeed!

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,850
Stop!

173
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,970
Enough talking to her.

174
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,700
Tell me yes or no.

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,220
Yes!

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,490
But we simply can't

177
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,020
afford the high price.

178
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,020
Wen Zhiqiu,

179
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,140
he almost ruined me and Bai Bingxin!

We wish we could eat his flesh
and sleep on his skin.

181
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,930
Yet you're buying his goods.

182
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,260
Isn't that pure humiliation?

183
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,610
I aim to humiliate you!

184
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,900
Let's say four times?

185
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,370
We still can't pay!

186
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,610
We will never bow to you!

187
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,100
But I will make you bow!

188
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,410
Three times, okay?

189
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,170
Mr. Tian,

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,580
we don't have enough funds now.

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,610
What price will work for you?

192
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,660

568
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,610
And you agreed.

569
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,330
When?

570
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,810
You woke up and that's your answer.

571
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,020
I thought it was a trick to wake me up.

572
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,570
No. That's not a trick.

573
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,570
That was my life's

574
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,220
most deliberate choice.

575
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,220
I need to think this over.

576
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,570
You're pushing your luck!

577
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,900
You have

578
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,220
one month

579
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,420
to recover.

580
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,700
Mind the steps.

581

[Grave of My Brother Xia Chu]

582
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,770
During trying times for the nation,

583
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,460
they've decided to keep it simple,

584
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,810
but the ceremony remains essential.

585
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,460
I'll serve as a bridesmaid.

586
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,420
If Spring Garden Restaurant
were still there,

587
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,610
I would have overseen

588
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,020
the entire wedding feast.

589
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,420
She has finally forgotten Xia Chu.

590
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,050
I think

591
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,050
if Xia Chu knew

592
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,700
Shaohua begins anew,

593
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,290
he'd surely rejoice for her.

594
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,980
Now, I alone

595
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,130
still remember him.

596
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,980
How quickly time flies!

597
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,530
In the blink of an eye,

598
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,050
five years have slipped by.

599
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,610
Shaohua should start afresh.

600
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,130
She chose to be with Wen Zhiqiu.

601
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,420
I heard he lay unconscious for 10 days!

602
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,210
She revived him with Miracle Pill.

603
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,210
Does the Miracle Pill

604
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,980
really work that well?

605
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,300
Absolutely!

606
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,420
Just her father and Shaozhong

607
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,980
never compounded the pill
with the prescription.

608
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,940
What a pity!

At least three months.

616
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,730
That long?

617
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,820
Mostly waiting for the fabric.

618
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,380
All our materials are imported.

619

621

with Japan.

Ready-made?

he rushed in when we just opened,

734
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,860
saying his mother's headache
was killing her.

735
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,980
He needed drugs to save her.
