1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Tell me what you want to hear.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tell me what you want to hear.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Tell me what you want to hear.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The End

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Dad, please explain everything to Nin.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Fahbart is the only descendant of the Asawakthewatin family.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
His father was murdered and he died.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The living god sent a?m to help Fahbart

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and ordered Fahbart to be exiled abroad with the?m.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't know who did this to my father.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you want to know who did this to your father, you have to go to M.Mali.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm Kanin, Asawakthewatin.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I found a body in the village and I don't know who it is.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you prove it, I'll report it to the police.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't go to the police. This is Tatanai's body.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What did you just say?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Tatanai has died.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I order you to take the responsibility of taking care of Kanin.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because of your duty, you are not allowed to see Kanin.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The living god gave the body to Coach Thanit as a training for the god.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you, sir.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sir.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sir.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tatanai.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sir.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sir, do you hear me?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I want to ask you to tell me who is our enemy.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't catch the murderer.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll let someone to find out.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I understand, but do you think Fahbart is the murderer?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This picture was taken by my people at the Hedro airport.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think Tatanai will be in M.Mali now.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

34
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you.

35
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm the son of the king Vasin.

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have prepared the work and it's a great honor.

37
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I must thank Fahbart, the living god,

38
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
for giving this work to me.

39
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And thank you, sir,

40
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
for leading the Hedro to help me score in this round of the competition.

41
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And this time, I would like to congratulate Kanin.

42
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Thank you very much.

43
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you.

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't you think Vasin will cheer for a dancer like Aewa?

45
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Aewa is the best at shooting arrows.

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't guess anything now. Let's watch the competition first.

47
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,500
Thank you.

48
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thank you.

49
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Welcome to the second round of the competition.

50
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This time, it's a test of shooting arrows.

51
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The three contestants have prepared their weapons.

52
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There are four types of arrows in this competition.

53
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Normal arrows,

54
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
arrow of a bear,

55
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
arrow of a horse,

56
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
arrow of a snake.

57
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Each type of arrow will receive different scores.

58
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When the time is up,

59
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the one who gets the highest score will be the winner of this round.

60
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The one who gets the highest score will be the winner of this round.

61
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your duty is to go to the highest point.

62
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This competition is not clean anymore, Aewa.

63
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You have to do everything to win this competition.

64
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you want to change Emily,

65
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you can do it.

66
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I will do my best to win this competition.

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you are ready,

68
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000

78,

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What happened?

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
A smoke bomb.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What happened?

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Father.

157
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Send someone to find Karin.

158
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Send the soldiers to find out the cause.

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's going on?

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Karin and Minar are fighting?

161
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Minar and Karin never fight.

162
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please let us investigate first.

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Please send the king and the king to the capital.

164
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We can't let our daughter risk like this.

165
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The people of the Royal Army should have already investigated.

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sorry, but we don't know what happened at the battlefield.

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Please go to the safe place first.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please.

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Ying.

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Are you okay?

171
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Be careful.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's the same color as us.

173
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's a trap.

174
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They deliberately planned the plan to be like we killed each other.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's go.

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you okay?

177
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm fine.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm fine.

179
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm fine.

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm fine.

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Are you okay?

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let me help you.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Are you okay?

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm fine.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
See?

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let's go.

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
See you at the meeting point.

188
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please.

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Father, are you worried about the king?

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The king will be safe no matter what.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Excuse me.

192
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please.

193
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Please.

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Please.

195
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Please.

196
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Please.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Please.

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Please.

199
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please.

200
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Please.

201
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Please.

202
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry for escaping.

203
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why did you come back when you escaped?

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I didn't mean to escape.

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But being watched all the time

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
makes it difficult to work.

207
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But I did what the priest ordered me to do.

208
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm looking for the culprit.

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And this is the evidence that I gathered.

210
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Fahbad.

212
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Take care of yourself.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't think it's appropriate.

214
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I came here today because I have something important to talk to you.

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I will protect you

216
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
if you cooperate with us.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You want me to cooperate with Fahbad?

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So this must be a secret.

220
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Don't tell anyone, even the living god.

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't understand.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't you trust the living god?

223
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not that I don't trust you.

224
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But I have to do everything for the safety of Kaning.

225
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I lost her before.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't want to lose her again.

227
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you mean

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the living god doesn't trust you?

229
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
For you,

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I see you as the living god.

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You are just Kaning.

232
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Please cooperate with us.

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Now, the king has sent a new code

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
for you, Kaning.

235
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What code?

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The code of the king's name.

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can see it now.

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I will give you the code.

239
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The king has made it clear.

240
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He must have a plan.

241
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We don't have any news yet.

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But it could be that he might be investigating the news

243
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,000
or hurt people.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What's the name of that coach?

245
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Coach Joe.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Coach Joe.

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I need your help.

248
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What is it?

249
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Coach Joe.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Coach Joe used to be a soldier at Phuchong Pissut.

251
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And he suddenly became a national-level swordsman.

252
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Just a few months.

253
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Alright.

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
First, Phuchong Pissut is suspicious.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But when we found out the truth,

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:58,520
we found out that Phuchong Pissut was just a

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The coach Joe's history is the information that came up.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Please try to hurt each other.

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If you get caught, it means you are caught.

260
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So please cooperate with me.

261
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I think we can do it for Sir Kanin.

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
How did it happen?

263
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sure that there's nothing about Fahbad.

264
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Fahbad just followed the advice of Sir Wasin.

265
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Go get it done.

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, sir.

267
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I sent it to you.

268
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I sent it to you.

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This forest is very dangerous.

270
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There are both bad animals and many traps.

271
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I looked from the ruins and there were a lot of traps.

272
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's like a plan to trap the bad guys.

273
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I never thought before that I would be the owner of Wasin.

274
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because he seems to be a good person.

275
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
People don't know each other.

276
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And why do you think the owner of Wasin will commit a crime?

277
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Power.

278
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Everyone needs power.

279
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Our country should be equal.

280
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
People like you want power for yourself.

281
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
To be more self-sufficient than people together.

282
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Did you check the stuff again?

284
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Again?

285
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes.

286
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If I didn't know that the country was peaceful,

287
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I would have had a war.

288
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You…

289
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What are you talking about?

290
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's here.

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
GPS.

292
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
GPS.

293
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
abandoned CPA

294
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Speak.

295
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
You should protect the prince.

296
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Go inside.

297
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Please, the prince.

298
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Please come in.

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Please come in.

300
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
This way, please.

301
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This way, please.

302
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Go.

303
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Catch the prince.

304
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Go.

305
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Go.

306
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Ouch.

307
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Sama.

308
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Sama.

309
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Are you hurt?

310
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm fine.

311
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Are you hurt anywhere?

312
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Are you okay?

313
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm fine.

314
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
This egg has a tracking device.

315
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But this is what the prince gave me.

316
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Your highness, I've been looking for Fahproud.

317
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If you find him, the one who is holding the throne will find us.

318
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You mean…

319
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The one who is holding the throne is the prince Vassin?

320
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because you don't have a heir, you have to get rid of the heir from other family?

321
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Other family?

322
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
If you want to know the truth, you have to get out of here as soon as possible.

323
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm not sure what else is in this forest.

324
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
But you have the key.

325
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Wai.

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Let's get out of here.

327
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Bring the crown.

328
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yes, your highness.

329
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Are you all safe?

330
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I've separated the two families as I prepared.

331
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
We will meet again in Ra-Win palace.

332
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Are you okay?

333
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm fine.

334
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Sir, are you safe?

335
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm fine.

336
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Are there more people than us?

337
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
We're almost there.

338
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You think you can escape?

339
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What do you want?

340
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Nothing. I never want anything from an old man like you.

341
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You took my lover and my family away.

342
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Wait. Calm down.

343
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Let's talk and talk.

344
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And we will forgive you.

345
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And we will allow you to flee to other country.

346
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I will take your revenge.

347
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You have killed many people.

348
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You don't know that the one who killed my wife's daughter is your father.

349
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So what's the matter with the prince?

350
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So what's the matter with the prince?

351
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The prince of the house of the king is at the kingdom of the gods.

352
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Now you are worried about the weather in the country that is very bad.

353
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The prince will be back from the kingdom of the gods?

354
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No, but I received the news from my family.

355
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
How do you know it's true?

356
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There is no reason to lie.

357
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh, you are so good at looking at the world.

358
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm so happy for you.

359
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,500
Yes, mom.

360
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
My family is not lying.

361
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Please have mercy on the people.

362
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
How?

363
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I want you to order the company to receive compensation

364
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and hold a趣 committee for her radar device

365
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
not to make the people's life in the trouble.

366
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's difficult.

367
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's said that we have been cursed.

368
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's a great blessing, Your Majesty.

369
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Yes.

370
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Then I bid farewell and wish you a healthy and prosperous life, Your Majesty.

371
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Thank you.

372
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We would like to ask for your help, Your Majesty.

373
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We would like to ask you to help us to put down the law of politics.

374
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The law of politics?

375
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We have examined the gold mine at the temple and found that the city has not been handling the crime.

376
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So we would like to ask for cooperation from all parties to present the law to take care of the city.

377
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Okay, I will help you.

378
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Thank you very much.

379
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:36,000
We would like to ask for your help to think of a technology that can help eliminate dust and pollution.

380
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Because now in Asawatthewatin, especially in Muangthong, we are experiencing this problem very much.

381
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Interesting.

382
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Think quickly.

383
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We should make a weather system to fix this problem.

384
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
It's an interesting idea, Your Majesty.

385
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yes.

386
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Nong Ying, Nong Ying, Nong Ying, Nong Ying, I'm here.

387
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What?

388
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you want me to report to the police?

389
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
No.

390
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay.

391
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Nong Ying, Nong Ying, Nong Ying, Nong Ying, Nong Ying, I'm here.

392
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Nong Ying.

393
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Why did you do this to me?

394
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
After releasing the medicine to cure lung disease and lung cancer,

396
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
now there are patients who come to the hospital to be treated more than 200% more than the average.

397
00:34:48,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I think I can make a lot of money.

398
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I think we should hurry up and develop this project.

399
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I will make all of you suffer more than Nong Ying.

400
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Announce that the king has ended the people with lung cancer.

401
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
When I announced that my wife died because of what?

403
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No one cares if my wife died because of the disease.

404
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Do you care about that disease?

405
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
My wife died because of lung cancer.

406
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
From the government's help in your care,

407
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
you finally became a lung cancer like my wife.

408
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But you don't think about solving any problems.

409
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You only care about the capital,

410
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
whether they will be useful

411
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and will they support you?

412
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Do you support you?

413
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
You only care about your family's power,

414
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
whether it will be useful.

415
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You don't care about the people, you don't care about the country.

416
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You should die.

417
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Your Majesty.

418
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Why did you protect her?

419
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You don't know that the one who killed your mother is her.

420
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You don't know that.

421
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Put the gun down.

422
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Help.

423
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I told you to put the gun down.

424
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Put the gun down.

425
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

426
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Put the gun down.

427
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Put the gun down.

428
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Your Majesty.

429
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Your Majesty.

430
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Why, Vinul?

431
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
How do you feel that everyone close to you is betraying you?

432
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You have to understand me.

433
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Listen to me.

434
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
My sister will die.

435
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
My family will die because of your country.

436
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Your Majesty must be Vinul's sister.

437
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You never betray anyone around you.

438
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Blood is thicker than water.

439
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You came to me

440
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
to protect me?

441
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's not a coincidence or intention.

442
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We are the same.

443
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Don't act like a traitor.

444
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I have to thank Vinul for sending the news to us.

445
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's why I saw the opportunity to revenge again.

446
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I want you to try to drink tea.

447
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Because it's tea that comes from England.

448
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
As soon as I knew from Vinul that Kanim was still alive,

449
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I sent someone to kill him immediately.

450
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Go away.

451
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
We have to change the plan. We will contact you soon.

452
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
When the plan to lure the army from England failed,

453
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I knew that I had to separate the people from Kanim.

454
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Otherwise, the plan would not be successful.

455
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I will take the responsibility of protecting Kanim's king.

456
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I will not allow the king to meet with Kanim.

457
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So I want the king's nephew to be defeated or be destroyed.

458
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Your Majesty.

459
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And I did it.

460
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The living god gave the sign to this coach

461
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
as a regular coach for the king.

462
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

463
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
But Coach Joe did it.

464
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So I have to change the plan to lend the king's hand.

465
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You are the one who killed the king.

466
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Keep it.

467
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I like it.

468
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But it's just a piece of shit.

469
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Why can't we do anything?

470
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Do you think there is no evidence to play their game?

471
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't dare to do anything.

472
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Finally, I have to be the one who is in trouble today.

473
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But I can't touch you.

474
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I have to do it with the person who is your hope.

475
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I understand you.

476
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But why don't we kill each other?

477
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No need to point out.

478
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We are the living gods.

479
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
They can't do anything to us.

480
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Are you sure?

481
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Are you sure?

482
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Are you sure?

483
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Where are you going?

484
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Hurry up.

485
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Are you ready?

486
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Nint.

487
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Nint.

488
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Nint.

489
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
How are you?

490
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I miss you.

491
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm fine.

492
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You go first.

493
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We'll talk later.

494
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So, wait.

495
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
This way.

496
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Nint.

497
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Quiet.

498
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Nint.

499
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Saki.

500
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Saki.

501
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Saki.

502
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Saki.

503
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Saki.

504
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Saki.

505
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Nint, what should we do?

506
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Saki.

507
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Saki.

508
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Saki.

509
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Saki.

510
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Saki.

511
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Saki,

512
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
we are here to visit

513
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the place where the king was talking.

514
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Can you tell me?

515
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And for the news of the competition,

516
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
the king will shoot the arrow around the city of Meenanakarin.

517
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What's wrong with the living god?

518
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The competition still has to go on, doesn't it?

519
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
A little bit more.

520
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The audience will be the biggest in the land.

521
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I just see that we have a chance to change.

522
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I just have to fight for the sword to win.

523
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm sorry, my king.

524
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The living god.

525
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
The living god.

526
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Every minute is not just about us

527
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I will remember every night

528
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Let love go away

529
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Just hear the sound of heart
