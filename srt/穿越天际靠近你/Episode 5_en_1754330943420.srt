There are three competitions

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
between the royal family.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't think it's appropriate, Your Majesty.

have been a tradition for a long time.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Changing the rules is not appropriate, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I understand.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
However, I don't agree with the family.

82
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I only propose this to

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,820
and it gives you back somebody he loves.

183
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,460
then that repeatedly affects the intern,

184
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,780
Not沏's problem.

185
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,100
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,500
It's my fault.

187
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,020
I've been talking to her for long.

188
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,780
Okay, provide me this.

189
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,860
you already had it in your mind and get it back.

190
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,940
Not you you!

191
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
not you.

192
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Do you have tissue?

193
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
No.

194
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,140
I'll go find it.

195
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
I'll go.

196
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,500
Why are you here so early?

197
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,900
I thought you were my friend.

199
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
It's okay.

200
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,420
Can I get a taxi?

201
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,540
It's just a small fee.

202
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
It's okay.

203
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
If you're okay, I'll go.

204
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Okay.

205
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
Hey,

206
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,260
I...

207
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,540
If you need anything, just tell me.

208
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Thank you.

209
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,980
But I'll call it a day.

210
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
891.891.com

211
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,140
The most exciting PG game online.

212
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
The mahjong is over.

213
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
The mahjong is over 2.

214
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,140
The prize-winning queen.

215
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,140
The treasure-seeking golden city.

216
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
The talented cat.

217
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
The prize-winning captain.

218
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
The super high rate of compensation.

219
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,140
The reward is high.

220
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,140
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,140
Hurry up and join.

222
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Macau's new Beijing Entertainment City.

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,140
891.891.com

224
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,140
Come in.

225
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Hello, sir.

226
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm at the Faculty of Engineering.

227
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,140
This semester, I'm the assistant teacher.

228
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,140
It's the same as last semester, right?

229
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Yes.

230
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Please take care of me this semester.

231
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Okay.

232
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
This is Kawin.

233
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,140
He's a student from Buche.

234
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,140
He just moved to our Faculty.

235
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
What?

236
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,140
He's a student from Buche.

237
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
He just moved to our Faculty.

238
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Hello, I'm Jay.

239
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
You may not be familiar with this place.

240
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
Please take care of him.

241
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Thank you.

242
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,140
This way is our Faculty building.

243
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,140
And this area is our Faculty.

244
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Why did you come to study here?

245
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Because it's my country.

246
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
This university is very famous for its art.

247
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,140
What's your best art skill?

248
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Do you draw?

249
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
I don't know yet.

250
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
But I can do everything.

251
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
What's your skill?

252
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
I think it's drawing.

253
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,140
This is the cloth I borrowed from you this morning.

254
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
I'll wash it for you.

255
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
Then I'll return it to you.

256
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,140
It's okay. I'll give it to you.

257
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
No.

258
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
It's expensive.

259
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,140
I'll wash it first.

260
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Then I'll kill the virus.

261
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,140
Then I'll return it to you.

262
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,140
The national flag of Mali

263
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,140
is the symbol of the four tribes.

264
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,140
The symbol of Asawa Thewatin is the golden horse.

265
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,140
Golden horse is the symbol of the four tribes.

266
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
Because the Asawa Thewatin

267
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
is made of many kinds of gold.

268
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,140
So gold is an economic product.

269
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
You seem to be out of your mind.

270
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,140
I have no energy to study anymore.

271
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Then you should take a break.

272
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Take a break from studying.

273
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,140
Come and see this.

274
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,140
This is the national flag of Phan Dap.

275
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,140
The king of Tharin sent it to the king.

276
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Why do you want to see it?

277
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,140
The king of Tharin was very concerned and cared about the king.

278
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,140
So he sent a good teacher to the king.

279
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Then please let me choose.

280
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Then let me choose.

281
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,140
No, I can't.

282
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Please choose.

283
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
I have no mood to do anything.

284
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Please try a little bit.

285
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Please.

286
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
You want me to choose a coach, right?

287
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
Yes.

288
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:48,140
I remember that Chakri has something that she hasn't told me yet.

289
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,140
If she tells me where the flag is, I will choose it.

290
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,140
I don't like it.

291
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Then I won't choose.

292
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
No, I can't.

293
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Please choose.

294
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,140
If you don't tell me where the flag is, I won't choose.

295
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
Then I will go out to find the flag.

296
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,140
That's not a big deal.

297
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,140
If you go out of your own kingdom, you will definitely be forgotten.

298
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Then take me to the flag.

299
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Fahmad.

301
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Fahmad, you're running to catch me, right?

302
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Bi, Fahmad.

303
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Fahmad.

304
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
I give up.

305
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
I give up.

306
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
I give up.

307
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Today.

308
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
You're done with the coach, right?

309
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Let's go to the gym.

310
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Fahmad.

311
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Let's change clothes.

312
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Fahmad.

313
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Let's go to the gym.

314
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Put your heart at ease.

315
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,860
Then let the

316
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,600
I thought you'll take best out of theipeineb project

317
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,240
what should i do

318
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:10,900
okay

319
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,180
after a product

320
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,180
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,580
The picture of Aiden...

322
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,460
Did you draw it?

323
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,780
I don't have time to draw it.

324
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,540
But after this, I'll have more time to work on art.

325
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,460
The beautiful Aiden

326
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,100
reminds me of greed in human's mind.

327
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,340
Human is destined to control everything in this world.

328
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,620
The more we have to stop it,

329
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,940
the more we want to own it.

330
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,700
It's hard to stop that feeling.

331
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,420
aussi.

332
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I'm sorry.

333
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
How was your drawing?

334
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,700
I drew an abstract.

335
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
I saw the picture you drew last time.

336
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Is there anything bothering you?

337
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
It's hard to answer.

338
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
If there's something stressful,

339
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
it can be released through art.

340
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Well,

341
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
I can't say much about the incident.

342
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
But as a fan of Emily,

343
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
I just want to let you know

344
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
that I'm worried about you too.

345
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Don't worry about that.

346
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
You're safe.

347
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm relieved

348
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
that you're still worried about me.

349
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Keep drawing.

350
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Yes, sir.

351
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
What are you doing here?

352
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
I just happened to pass by.

353
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
What's wrong?

354
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm sorry.

355
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
What's wrong with you?

362
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm fine.

363
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Don't worry.

364
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Oh,

365
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
you're going to the toilet.

366
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Please believe me.

367
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Why did you come here?

368
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
See you next week.

369
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
What are you doing here?

373
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm here to see the place.

374
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
To learn.

375
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Why don't you stay with me?

376
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Why are you here?

377
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
You didn't answer my message.

378
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I still worry that you're sick and want to understand him.

379
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
He's your boss.

380
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Your boss takes care of the prince.

381
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
His highness,

382
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
you stay with him.

383
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
He's your master.

384
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
So he doesn't clocks to the time.

385
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,900
Cond

386
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,100
Th people

387
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
must be at a place in the tier

388
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,660
With

389
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:07,660
release

390
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,660
playing

391
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,580
So

392
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,580
that

393
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I'll leave you to your business.

394
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
I'll go to teach first.

395
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
As for the conversation,

396
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
I'll talk to you later.

397
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,580
If it's not too much of a bother,

398
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I want you to keep the position of the prince as a concubine

399
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,580
as you wish.

400
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Who are you?

401
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,180
One has to surpass one to have something in common.

402
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Whatever one is born, will be perfect.

403
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
But one can learn it all.

404
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
I'm sorry.

405
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,900
It's not about that.

406
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,420
I think you should go back to your room.

407
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,060
You have to go back with me.

408
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,220
I'm afraid that it's not now or soon.

409
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,220
You don't have my permission?

410
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,580
It's not like that.

411
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,820
But I have to work here.

412
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,580
Okay?

413
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,980
I realize now.

414
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,780
predicament

415
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,780
I think she's the one who sent this photo.

416
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
So I brought it back for her.

417
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,780
Well, the car is waiting for us over there.

418
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,780
We haven't gone back yet.

419
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780
I saw that she was in a hurry to come out.

420
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
So I thought...

421
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,780
How can I go back? Why didn't she follow me?

422
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Chakri, take her to the cemetery.

423
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,780
Phra Baad, she sent you the order.

424
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,780
But you haven't followed me.

425
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,780
If you do that, I'll be a thief.

426
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,780
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

427
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
No.

428
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
Thank you.

429
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
You're a thief?

430
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I'm sorry, I'm a thief.

431
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Hello.

432
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Hello.

433
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Do you want to drink alcohol?

434
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
No, I'm fine.

435
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Have you seen this person?

436
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,780
Yes, I have.

437
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
I think I've seen her somewhere.

438
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
You have? Where?

439
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
I don't think I've seen her.

440
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Have you seen her?

441
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
No, I haven't.

442
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
Have you seen her?

443
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
I think it's been a long time.

444
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,780
It's hard to think.

445
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,780
But if you have something that can stimulate your thoughts,

446
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
it will be easy to think.

447
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
How much do you want?

448
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
We're friends.

449
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
How much do you want?

450
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
I have to use my brain.

451
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
I have to think a lot and pay for it.

452
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,780
You can take a little bit.

453
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,780
How much do you want?

454
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
Take a little bit.

455
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
You can pay for it later.

456
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
You can pay for it later.

457
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
Can I have some alcohol?

458
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Yes, you can.

459
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
Can I have some alcohol?

460
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
Yes, you can.

461
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Thank you.

462
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
You can't find the person who stole the money.

463
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
Come to me and find her.

464
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Yes, I can.

465
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,780
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,780
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,780
I'm sorry.

474
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
I'm sorry.

475
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
You should go to rest.

481
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,780
Thank you.

482
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
I'm sorry.

483
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,780
Add some color here.

484
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
To make it look more romantic.

485
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Here?

486
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
Can you do it like this?

487
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
P'Type.

488
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
I'm sorry.

489
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Is this what you want?

490
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Come with me.

491
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
Wait.

492
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Don't you know who you belong to?

493
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
What do you do for a living?

494
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
I don't know who I belong to.

495
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
I don't know what I do.

496
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,780
I don't have any right to tell you.

497
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Don't be a artist.

498
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
I'm a god.

499
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
My enemy.

500
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
If you don't want to be in trouble,

501
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
don't stay with them.

502
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
No.

503
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

504
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

505
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

506
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

507
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

508
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

509
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

510
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

511
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

512
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

513
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

514
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

515
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

516
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

517
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

518
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
I know that you have a lot on your mind.

519
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,780
Please help me, my dear.

520
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
You are mine.

521
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Mine alone.

522
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,780
The End

523
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Buy all the equipment.

524
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Buy all the clothes.

525
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Don't let anyone get it.

526
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
Yes, sir.

527
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,780
You know why I called you here, right?

529
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,780
You only do stupid things.

530
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Where can you get the wisdom to fight against him?

531
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Thank you, sir.

532
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
I have chosen a new coach for you.

533
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,780
From now on, the competition is the most important thing in your life. Remember that.

534
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,780
Yes, sir. I will do my best.

535
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Good. If you don't do your best, I will fire your close friend.

536
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
Yes, sir.

537
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
Thank you.

538
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Thank you.

539
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,780
No one told you that you have to change your position?

540
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,780
This is my coach. Please give him a hug.

541
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,780
I will go to practice with the national coach first.

542
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,780
And you can practice with your body first.

543
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:43,100
Fighting, English

544
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Fighting

545
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Have you put it back?

546
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,780
Do you have anything for me to use?

547
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
You want this, right?

548
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,780
If you don't have anything for me to use, please excuse me.

549
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,780
I have just finished drawing the picture of Eden. Please give it to me.

550
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
Thank you, sir.

551
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
Thank you for thinking of an old man like me.

552
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,780
Your drawing is beautiful.

553
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Thank you, sir.

554
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,780
And the statue of the god of death has a pattern from Eden.

555
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,780
In this picture, it is the anger of the mother.

556
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
I will go to practice with the national coach.

557
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Thank you.

558
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
I have something to do.

559
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Please give me a new role.

560
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Please stay.

561
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
I have something to ask you.

562
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I have been practicing in the field.

563
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
I don't have a coach to take care of me.

564
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
I feel lost.

565
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,780
I don't know if I can practice well.

566
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
I know that I'm not a newbie.

567
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I'm like a newbie.

568
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
But I'm very determined to compete.

569
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,780
I hope you understand that I do it for your safety.

570
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,780
Don't worry about the coach.

571
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
I will find a good coach for you.

572
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I understand what you did at that time.

573
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,780
But the coach who will train you is something I'm thinking about.

574
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:45,780
I think the coach who will help you practice should be someone who understands you and gives you advice.

575
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,780
I think one person is suitable for you.

576
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:58,780
I think you should know yourself and win the competition.

577
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,780
I want you to be my coach.

578
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
I'm sorry.

579
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
You shouldn't say that to me.

580
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
I'm just telling the truth.

581
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
It's normal to change.

582
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
I'm not changing.

583
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I just change.

584
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
I know what I have to do.

585
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
And you want that from me.

586
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,780
I just want you to be with me.

587
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Since you brought me back, you've been away from me.

588
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,780
Why can't you be my coach?

589
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
I'm sorry.

590
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
Or you don't want to be with me?

591
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,780
You flew across the sky and brought me back.

592
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
And you're leaving me?

593
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
You don't want to use me anymore?

594
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
I didn't think that way.

595
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
If you don't want us to see each other again,

596
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
we won't see each other again?

597
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,780
Answer me.

598
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,780
Do you think you're suitable for me?

599
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I'm not suitable for you, right?

600
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
I'm not suitable for you, right?

601
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
I'm sorry.

602
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,780
I'm sorry.

603
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Can you answer me?

604
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,780
Why can't you be my coach?

605
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I don't want to see you again.

606
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm sorry.

607
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,780
From now on, I'll be your coach.

608
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,780
If you have any questions, please leave the job.

609
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Thank you for watching.

610
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,780
You look very happy today.

611
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,780
I'm sorry to bother you again.

612
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
I won't be able to teach you again.

613
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,780
I don't know when you'll be able to teach me again.

614
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Until the competition to draw from the competition,

615
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
I will not be able to teach you again.

616
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Until the competition to draw from the competition,

617
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I will not be able to teach you again.

618
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
Until the competition to draw from the competition,

619
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
I will not be able to teach you again.

620
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Is there anything wrong?

621
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
There are messages.

622
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
And about Mr. Tat,

623
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,780
I sent him a picture.

624
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,780
You can try.

625
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,780
I'm at the same place as we met in Thailand.

626
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,780
I think Tat is going to emily now.

627
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,780
I'll find out first and tell you again.

628
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,780
If there's anything, please update me.

629
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Thank you very much.

630
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,780
You're very good, Chakri.

631
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
You ordered it from Thailand?

632
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Yes.

633
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
So fresh.

634
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
Fahbad.

635
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Fahbad sent off the costume for the competition.

636
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Why did you hug him?

637
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Hug him first.

638
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,780
Fahbad wants you to be his coach, right?

639
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
1, go up and down.

640
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,780
2, go up and down.

641
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Continue, Fahbad.

642
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Faster, Fahbad.

643
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Faster.

644
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
1, 2, go faster.

645
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,780
3, go faster.

646
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,780
Faster, Fahbad.

647
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
Come on.

648
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
Thank you.

649
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,780
How much did you tell me to do?

650
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,780
You can do only 3 sets.

651
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
You can't do it like me.

652
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,780
No, I'm just tired.

653
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
Faster, Fahbad.

654
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
Faster.

655
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
My lord.

656
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,780
Where did you hurt the king?

657
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,780
I hurt the king.

658
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,780
This side or the other side?

659
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:57,780
No, this side.

660
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
What's wrong?

661
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,780
The doctor said that the condition is bad.

662
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,780
Go to the medical department.

663
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:18,780
I think I should go.

664
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Yes.

665
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
I think my condition is better.

666
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,780
If your condition is better, we will come back to train you.

667
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:34,780
I feel hurt again.

668
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:51,780
This training is an important skill for the body.

669
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,780
It will make you more patient and can fight longer.

670
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,780
I can't do it anymore.

671
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,780
I have a toothache.

672
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,780
Are you sure?

673
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,780
I'm sure.

674
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,780
I will try harder.

675
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,780
I will try harder.

676
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Please take it.

677
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
Let me see your teeth.

678
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,780
Slow down.

679
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,780
Please sick blessings.

680
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,120
How are they related to you?

681
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
So you less know.

682
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,060
It's you!

683
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,620
Listen…

684
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,880
I'll do everything you say.

685
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,920
I'll live my life to the fullest,

686
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,440
and not to yol weld.

687
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,540
All right?

688
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,420
Yes, sir.

689
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,040
How's it going?

690
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,740
I'm almost there.

691
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,740
to the Royal Palace.

692
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

693
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,740
Please take me there.

694
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,740
Your Majesty.

695
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,740
Your Majesty, you made a mistake.

696
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,740
So you lost the game.

697
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
I think you should take a break.

698
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:15,740
I have to go now.

699
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,740
If you need anything,

700
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,740
you can always tell me.

701
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,740
The southern city of Emmery,

702
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,740
the main product is the dark champagne egg.

703
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,740
It's beautiful.

704
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,740
Do you want to see the dark champagne egg?

705
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,740
It's hard to find.

706
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,740
If you want it, you have to order it first.

707
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,740
If you want to see it, I will take you there.

708
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,740
This egg is my mother's treasure.

709
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,740
My father ordered me to make it.

710
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,740
And give it to my mother on her wedding day.

711
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,740
Please allow me.

712
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,740
I trust you.

713
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,740
To close in all the time.

714
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,740
I trust you.

715
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,740
I trust you.

716
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,740
I trust you.

717
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,740
I trust you.

718
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,740
I trust you.

719
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,740
Whatever I have to ask, you tell me.

720
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,740
And just like that, I will not leave.

721
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Remember me and take me to the end of the world.
