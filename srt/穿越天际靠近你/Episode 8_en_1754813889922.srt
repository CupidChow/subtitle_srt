1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
Please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

2
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,200
Yes.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,720
Your Royal Highness!

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,760
Your Royal Highness...

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,680
Your Royal Highness!

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,240
His Royal Highness is now safe.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Fortunately, Mr. Charan intervened

8
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,080
and raised concerns
about the poison in time.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,520
Thank you, Charan.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,360
Mr. Charan has been reinstated
as your coach, Your Royal Highness.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,640
Chakri didn't lie;
you did stay by my side.

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,360
I vow...

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,760
to protect you with my life.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Ran.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,080
What?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Still find it strange?

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,240
Are you still thinking about...

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,360
last night?

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,120
Will you give me a bite of that macaron?

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Please.

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,479
Give me a bite.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
I want to be spoiled.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
Would you really deny my plea?

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
Oh...

25
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,079
Prince Calvin!

26
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm here to see Prince Khanin.

27
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,760
Oh...

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Please proceed this way,
Your Royal Highness.

29
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,890
Have you recovered from your illness?

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,160
You sure have a sharp eye.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,740
I'm feeling much better now,

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
both physically...

33
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
and emotionally.

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,880
Would you like some macarons?

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
I shall not disturb you.

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,120
Please feel free to carry on.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,040
You just came to ask that?

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Knowing that you've recovered,

39
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,610
I feel at ease.

40
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,800
I shall take my leave.

41
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,960
But I don't think he'll tell anyone.

42
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,090
I believe there is nothing
to worry about.

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,400
But from now on, let's be more cautious

44
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
when we're close, Your Royal Highness.

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
We don't need to.

46
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Your Royal Highness...

47
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,540
I want to be this close to you.

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
What's wrong with that?

49
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,880
Let's do what I said.

50
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,840
Come on.

51
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Let's go to my room.

52
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Please get some rest.

53
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Chakri,

54
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,320
I want something.

55
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
Can you order it for me?

56
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,220
You're talking about...

57
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,540
Lolane Intense Care Water Treatment?

58
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,520
We still have them, Your Royal Highness.

59
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Yeah, that's good.

60
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Make sure we're not running out of them.

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,760
But what I was talking about...

62
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
is...

63
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,190
What is it, Your Royal Highness?

64
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,560
What's the emblem
of the Davichmetha clan?

65
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,600
Uh...

66
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,200
A bird.

67
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,520
That's correct.

68
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,920
What kind of bird?

69
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,960
I need to know that, too?

70
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,200
Yes.

71
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,360
Who would know that?

72
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
A flamingo, I guess.

73
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,340
Nin, if you fail to be attentive,

74
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,960
you may face unexpected problems
during the Competition.

75
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
I just don't know the answer.

76
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,059
If you do, tell me.

77
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
How about this?

78
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
If I get it wrong one more time,

79
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm willing to be punished by you.

80
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,640
Come on, I'll let you punish me.

81
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,280
What kind of punishment do you want?

82
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,600
Well...

83
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
One wrong answer,

84
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,680
and I'll give you a kiss.

85
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,800
One kiss for one wrong answer.

86
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,240
Right here.

87
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,290
How exactly is that a punishment?

88
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Of course it is!

89
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
It's all on me.

90
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,440
You won't kiss me,

91
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,300
but I'll kiss you.

92
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,040
What?

93
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,920
You were literally...

94
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,880
Anyway,

95
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
it's just a kiss.

96
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,410
Let's focus on our lesson.

97
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,870
What is the former capital of Emmaly?

98
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
♫When looking at the sky,♫

99
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,570
Higher.

100
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,840
Again.

101
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,800
♫Yet I don't think it's much of a climb♫

102
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,170
You need to be faster.

103
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,880
♫If our love feels out of sight,♫

104
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,600
♫Just hold each other's hand tight♫

105
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,360
♫I believe that love conquers all,♫

106
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,600
♫Nothing can make it fall♫

107
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,390
Faster!

108
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,950
♫As long as you're with me,
right by my side,♫

109
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,440
♫I am not afraid♫

110
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,360
Your Royal Highness!

111
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,200
♫No matter how endless
the sky may seem,♫

112
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,160
♫And how treacherous
this journey might be,♫

113
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,440
♫If I must cross the heavens,
I'll set out willingly,♫

114
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,520
♫As long as you're there,
waiting for me♫

115
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,280
♫We'll build a bridge
of a million stars,♫

116
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,560
♫Let love guide us, no matter how far♫

117
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,800
♫All I ask
is to trust in love and in me,♫

118
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,600
♫Take my hand and you will see,♫

119
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,710
♫Above the sky, we're meant to be♫

120
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,260
You beat me again.

121
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,760
It's no fun at all.

122
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,090
Your shoulder twitches
before lunging again.

123
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,280
I didn't mean to.
What do you want me to do?

124
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,320
You need to stay more focused.

125
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,810
When all you care about is winning,

126
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,560
it tends to backfire.

127
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
Let me ask you something.

128
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,520
Does being adopted by His Majesty
mean you have to be a fencing expert?

129
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,920
I was born into the Phithakthewa family,

130
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,480
so I've been learning fencing
since I was little.

131
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,010
Why, though?

132
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,200
My family serves as royal guards,
protecting the Assavadevathins.

133
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,320
But why would they have to do that?

134
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,180
My ancestors swore
an oath to His Majesty

135
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,280
the moment he was crowned king.

136
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,560
So it's inherited?

137
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
Even if I hadn't said anything
to Grandfather,

138
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,800
you still would've become my guard.

139
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,120
Whether I become a royal guard or not

140
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,420
is solely up to His Majesty.

141
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,070
Do you protect me this well

142
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,920
just because of some oath
your ancestors made?

143
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,760
If it's my duty,

144
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,880
I need to do it
to the best of my ability.

145
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,080
How about...

146
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,920
this thing?

147
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,410
About that,

148
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm sure you can tell
from everything I've done.

149
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,540
A reward for being so sweet.

150
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,080
It's been such a long day.

151
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,040
I don't wanna fence anymore.

152
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Let's do something else.

153
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
How about we go have some fun?

154
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Wanna touch him?

155
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,760
Is this how we're gonna have fun?

156
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,660
It sure will be fun.

157
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,910
Your turn.

158
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,200
Don't worry.

159
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,420
Dyrane never harms anyone.

160
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,640
Dyrane?

161
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,600
That's his name.

162
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,320
Come on, touch him.

163
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Let's get to know each other,
so you'll feel more comfortable.

164
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,780
You and him seem so close.

165
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,840
I've trained him myself.

166
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,660
It's only natural we're close.

167
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,840
Seriously, being close to a horse?

168
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,080
Have you introduced yourself to him?

169
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,360
What?

170
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,080
I need to do that with a horse?

171
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,600
Yeah, so you'll get closer quickly.

172
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Fine, here we go.

173
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,920
Dyrane...

174
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm Nin,

175
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Khanin.

176
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,960
Please don't kick me, okay?

177
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,920
I want to be friends.

178
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,020
Let's be friends, alright?

179
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Is this a joke?

180
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,560
It was your plan, wasn't it?

181
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,510
That's for tricking me.

182
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,440
I won't do it again.

183
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,480
Come here.

184
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Hold the saddle right here firmly.

185
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,150
Put your left foot in the stirrup

186
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,280
and push yourself up.

187
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,760
Go on, try it.

188
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,000
Here, hold this.

189
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Don't tense up.

190
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not.

191
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,800
Let me know if it scares you.

192
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,920
It won't as long as you're here.

193
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,640
Ran...

194
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,040
Should we call it a day? We might fall.

195
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,420
He's not moving.

196
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
We'll never fall.

197
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
You should've told me you wanted a hug.

198
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,860
You should've done it if you knew.

199
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,040
It feels nice,
just being together like this.

200
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,960
Then, let's be together for eternity.

201
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,640
We've got tough training ahead.

202
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,820
I don't want you to worry too much.

203
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,890
I will be fine

204
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,440
as long as you're with me.

205
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,420
I've always been with you.

206
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,320
If there's anything
I can do for you, I will.

207
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,720
And I'll do my best
to always be there for you.

208
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
It's gonna be okay.

209
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I'm right here.

210
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,920
I had Chakri order it a while ago,

211
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
but I couldn't find the right moment
to give it to you.

212
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,120
Wait...

213
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
You should close your eyes.

214
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
Wear these when it rains,

215
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,440
so nothing will scare you now.

216
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,320
I just want to help you
through tough times,

217
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,360
the way you helped me survive mine

218
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
when I had no one but you.

219
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,800
Thank you.

220
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,080
You don't have to worry
about anything now.

221
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
I'll be right here for you, always.

222
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,040
Have you had enough
of Emmaly yet, Prince Calvin?

223
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,800
I would never have, Your Majesty.

224
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,840
I've enjoyed it here,

225
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,040
and with some friends at the university,

226
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,440
it's even more enjoyable.

227
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm grateful
you hold our country in high regard.

228
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,920
And how is your father doing?

229
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,960
He is pleased and in excellent health.

230
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,240
Should you need any help,

231
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,480
do not hesitate to ask.

232
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I am glad to help.

233
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,060
I appreciate your kindness.

234
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,470
You did mention your university.

235
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,580
How is everything going?
Is Charan attending to you properly?

236
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,440
He has been looking after me well.

237
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,180
During this long holiday,

238
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,780
my friend has invited me
to visit his hometown in Meenanagarin.

239
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
I see.

240
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,340
Oh, you're here.

241
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,660
Join us for a meal.

242
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Let me know if you need anything.

243
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,800
Prince Calvin just told me

244
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,800
he's visiting Meenanagarin.

245
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,480
Did you say Meenanagarin, Grandfather?

246
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
You want to come, too?

247
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,080
Yes.

248
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,960
I've just learned
about the dark champagne pearls,

249
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,400
so I want to see them
in their natural setting.

250
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,120
I see.

251
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
So,

252
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,600
would you like to join my trip?

253
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
May I accompany Prince Calvin
on the trip?

254
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,740
Alright, then.

255
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm coming as well.

256
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,580
It's been a long time
since I last visited there.

257
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,740
Alright?

258
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,580
Let me give you a hand.

259
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,860
Why are you not joining me
for a bike ride?

260
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,620
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

261
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,700
But...

262
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,860
today,

263
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:13,740
my muscles are sore.

264
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,780
A bike ride after a while feels so nice.

265
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
I've had enough of the fencing training.

266
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
But...

267
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,680
if Prince Rachata finds out

268
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,040
that you skipped your training...

269
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,540
My father will never know about it.

270
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
Trust me.

271
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,140
Companions

272
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,700
must endure

273
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,300
and take the blame for one another.

274
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,200
Father!

275
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
- Prince Ramil...
- Stop it!

276
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,640
Stop!

277
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,020
Just let go of me.

278
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,920
Stop it, Father.

279
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,140
Please, Father.

280
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,170
- Let go!
- Please stop.

281
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,090
Leave me alone!

282
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,160
- Prince Ramil!
- Father!

283
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,920
- Prince Ramil...
- It's not his fault at all!

284
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,880
Prince Ramil, you should stop.

285
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,200
Father, it's not his fault!

286
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,280
- Prince Ramil...
- What the hell?

287
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,820
- Take him out now.
- Your Royal Highness...

288
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,240
- Prince Ramil...
- Please stop!

289
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,500
Prince Ramil!

290
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,020
You should stop.

291
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,460
- Have you gone nuts?
- Please, Prince Ramil.

292
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,080
- Why?
- Guards!

293
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,680
- Paytai!
- Get him out of here.

294
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,340
- Prince Ramil...
- Please stop, Father!

295
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,480
Please!

296
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,530
Paytai!

297
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,760
Who said you could stop?

298
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,920
I...

299
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,960
I'd like...

300
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
a break, please.

301
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,440
Are you really going to
defy Prince Rachata's command?

302
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Stop!

303
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,200
Stay away from him.

304
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,760
That's a command from me,

305
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,040
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut.

306
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,360
Get rid of those.

307
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Your Royal Highness,

308
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,280
please don't get involved.

309
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,900
If Prince Rachata finds out,

310
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,320
I'll surely face
even harsher punishment.

311
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,090
No!

312
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,400
Now!

313
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,120
No more punishment.

314
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,240
I deserved it, Your Royal Highness.

315
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,010
Being your companion comes with a duty

316
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,920
to take the blame for you.

317
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,460
Come with me.

318
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,960
I trust that

319
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,200
you will keep me safe.

320
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,400
What are you going to do to me?

321
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
So...

322
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,180
is everything going well?

323
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
Both of you,

324
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,800
place this bag

325
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,700
and those two

326
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,220
at the door.

327
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,440
There's so much stuff.

328
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,160
Come on.

329
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,340
As you're aware,

330
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,610
formal attire is needed

331
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,650
when visiting other cities.

332
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,050
Right,

333
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:10,770
did you bring
my Lolane Intense Care, too?

334
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,000
Oh...

335
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,520
Yes.

336
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,910
That has been prepared,
Your Royal Highness.

337
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

338
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,300
Please make haste
to His Majesty's presence immediately.

339
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,120
Wirun!

340
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,120
I wish to talk to His Majesty
about the mining matter.

341
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,080
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

342
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,460
It'd be better to wait
until His Majesty is fully recovered.

343
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,460
I came to discuss a matter with you,

344
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,240
only to find out you had an accident.

345
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,560
Come on,

346
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,800
it's nothing serious.
No need to make a fuss.

347
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,600
Alright.

348
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,840
Are you okay, Grandfather?

349
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,800
I just had a little fall.

350
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Do not be concerned.

351
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,990
He injured his wrist

352
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,030
and has caught a cold,

353
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,610
so the doctors advise

354
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,240
against any travel.

355
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,250
Sickness

356
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,110
is simply a part of nature

357
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,910
and can happen to all.

358
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,200
That said, the trip to Meenanagarin

359
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,040
must proceed as scheduled.

360
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Otherwise, we'd be failing
Prince Calvin's trust.

361
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
I could use some rest, too.

362
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,710
Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Your Majesty.

363
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,160
I entrust Khanin and Prince Calvin
to your care.

364
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,080
They are on their way to Meenanagarin.

365
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

366
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,560
I shall take good care of
them and the entourage.

367
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,370
Please recover quickly, Your Majesty.

368
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,720
I am truly honored
by your visit to Meenanagarin.

369
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,440
The honor's all mine,
Your Royal Highness.

370
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
The royal attendants
shall take you to rest.

371
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,960
Please feel at ease, Prince Calvin.

372
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,800
Should you need anything, let us know.

373
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
I will.

374
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,560
I'm really glad
you came to visit us, Khanin.

375
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,310
I wish to learn about your culture

376
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,800
and see the dark champagne pearls
with my own eyes.

377
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,400
I humbly ask for your permission, Uncle.

378
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,760
You don't need my permission at all.

379
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,230
I'd like to stroll around the city

380
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,320
like an ordinary person.

381
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,600
Could you please treat me like one?

382
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,380
I'm more than happy to do as you ask.

383
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,720
However, as you are the important heir
of the Assavadevathins,

384
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,040
and Prince Calvin
will also be accompanying you,

385
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,490
I can't take any risks.

386
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,250
Therefore,

387
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,370
I will have my guards

388
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,830
discreetly protect you from a distance.

389
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,240
I hope you do not mind.

390
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,670
I don't, Uncle.

391
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,480
If my child were still alive,

392
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,970
he would be about your age.

393
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,080
I'm going to bed now.

394
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:54,930
Oh...

395
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,400
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

396
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:05,670
Should you need anything,
please don't hesitate to let me know.

397
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
Ran,

398
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,320
stay with me.

399
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,720
Not here.

400
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,930
Not there

401
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,360
and not here.

402
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,200
Looks like I'm the only one
wanting to stay with you.

403
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,690
I want to stay with you, too,

404
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,600
but I don't think
it's proper to do it here.

405
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Why not?

406
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,570
No one would doubt it.

407
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,890
A guard's duty is
to be by the prince's side.

408
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,450
Trust me on this.

409
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,810
Listen to me, okay?

410
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,200
Rest well.

411
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,640
We're having a trip tomorrow.

412
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,120
What a nice car to ride in.

413
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,690
It seems perfect for everyday use.

414
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,290
Do you recall that...

415
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,000
we've also ridden in
another model of this car?

416
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,200
Are there two models?

417
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
Yes.

418
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,680
You sure are good at this.

419
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,880
You know exactly
what fits each situation.

420
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,320
Oh...

421
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,640
Have you been here long?

422
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,440
Yeah.

423
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,160
Let's go for a walk, then.

424
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,480
Calvin!

425
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,380
Is everything okay?

426
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Yeah, everything's fine.

427
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,040
I was just texting my friend.

428
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,200
You've got a friend here?

429
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,880
He's a friend from Morpheus,

430
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,960
and he's from around here.

431
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,640
It's a semester break, so he's home.

432
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,070
I see.

433
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
So...

434
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,000
wanna go see him for a bit?

435
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,680
We can plan to meet up again later
to return to the palace.

436
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,560
Sounds nice?

437
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,680
Prince Wasin firmly instructed that...

438
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,760
Just send someone
to follow him at a distance.

439
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,400
A distance, you know?

440
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Come on,

441
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,560
we're on a trip here.

442
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,800
Just relax.

443
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,880
I understand his concerns, though.

444
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,600
You can send someone,

445
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,440
but make sure they keep their distance.

446
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
Thank you.

447
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Ran,

448
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,880
why are there only male vendors?

449
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,320
None of them are female.

450
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,420
In Meenanagarin,

451
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,960
it's believed that the husband
should provide for the family

452
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,560
while the wife is responsible
for the housework.

453
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,060
What?

454
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,520
Seriously?

455
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,780
Why do they still believe
in things like that?

456
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,480
What if a man doesn't want
to be the provider?

457
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,880
What if a woman doesn't want
to stay home?

458
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,940
Why can't we do things we love?

459
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,320
They should stop imposing
these roles on people.

460
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,980
Not saying anything?

461
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,650
You also believe in it?

462
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,850
I just think beliefs...

463
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,940
are the hardest thing to change.

464
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,200
But that doesn't mean
change is impossible,

465
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,800
right?

466
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,300
Yes.

467
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,570
It just takes time.

468
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
Yeah.

469
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,820
Let's check it out.

470
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,840
Feel free to look around.

471
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,460
Let me know if you like anything.

472
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,900
Feel free.

473
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,820
Let's go further.

474
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,620
Okay.

475
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,060
Feel free to check them out.

476
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,440
Oh, you're the prince!

478
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,680
Do you have any dark champagne pearls?

479
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,550
Oh!

480
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,390
I just happen to have the last one!

481
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,360
Finally, a real one!

482
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
It's beautiful.

483
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,200
What do people usually make

484
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,560
with pearls this size?

485
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,920
They're usually made
into necklaces, Your Royal Highness.

486
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,760
A single pearl can enhance the elegance
of both the piece and the wearer.

487
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,480
So now we have to look for
a necklace maker?

488
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,820
About that,

489
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,600
please leave it to me.

490
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,600
Thanks.

491
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,140
Isn't it pretty?

492
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,560
It is.

493
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,860
- We'll take this, please.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,180
June!

495
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,740
June...

496
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,480
This is June, my sister.

497
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,480
My name is Calvin.

498
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,730
Are you okay?

499
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,380
You alright?

500
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,980
He came to travel.

501
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,520
You should show him around.

502
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,820
But Mom isn't home yet.

503
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,860
I can't leave you.

504
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,640
I'll be fine.

505
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,550
It's nothing.

506
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,590
I can wait.

507
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
You can stay with her.

508
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,260
Jay, just take him on a walk.

509
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,660
I'll be fine.

510
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,500
It's nothing.

511
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,980
Coming back this time,

512
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
her condition's gotten so much worse.

513
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,890
It's hard to believe

514
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,600
someone so young

515
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,040
could be that ill.

516
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,100
Now...

517
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,360
I understand
why you're part of the protesters.

518
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,060
This was never just about her illness.

519
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
The truth is,

520
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,380
my dad passed away

521
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,140
from a severe lung disease.

522
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,990
After that,

523
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,100
we left Assavadevathin and moved here.

524
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,570
I originally joined the movement

525
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,140
just to get justice for my dad...

526
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,500
and June.

527
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,380
But once I got involved,

528
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,700
I realized something.

529
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,700
If we don't fight for change,

530
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,540
how many more lives

531
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,200
will end up like my dad and my sister?

532
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,900
If we all stay quiet

533
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,280
and don't speak up,

534
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
how will anyone in charge

535
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,100
even know this problem exists?

536
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,670
But I think...

537
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,560
those in power
also want to help the people.

538
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,840
If they really do,

539
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,200
why is there no sign of progress?

540
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,240
If they do care,

541
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,480
shouldn't there be
some solutions by now?

542
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,680
Do you want to join me tomorrow?

543
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,200
Sure.

544
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,260
I appreciate your understanding.

545
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,140
We're friends after all.

546
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,860
Friends...

547
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,580
share both the good and the bad, right?

548
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,480
I never thought I'd like you this much.

549
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,320
The super strict...

550
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,480
and meticulous one...

551
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,060
Yet when you give me what I want,

552
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,560
you'll become the sweetest!

553
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,240
I can't give you everything you want.

554
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,880
- I have my duties to...
- Come on.

555
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,090
I know, I know.

556
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,660
That word again.

557
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,580
So being strict

558
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,340
is part of your duties,

559
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,170
but falling for me

560
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,600
is beyond them, right?

561
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,040
You understand me, right?

562
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,860
Yeah.

563
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,040
I'll try to.

564
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,120
Will you stay with me tonight?

565
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:38,870
I can't.

566
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Again?

567
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,100
Jeez.

568
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,550
At least...

569
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,840
join me for dinner,

570
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
please!

571
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,840
Come on, we'll just have dinner.

572
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,500
It's not a big deal.

573
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,380
Will you say yes?

574
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
Take a seat.

575
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,920
How was everything?

576
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,680
Did you have a good time, dear?

577
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,500
Your city is truly beautiful, Uncle.

578
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,200
And the air feels so fresh.

579
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,260
Make sure you come back often, then.

580
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,040
You're always welcome here.

581
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,340
Uncle,

582
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,420
actually,

583
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
there is something I wish to request.

584
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,580
What is it?

585
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,240
I came across this flyer.

586
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,040
And I hope to join the campaign

587
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,400
and sing with the people.

588
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,680
Sure.

589
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,040
The younger generation
holds you in great admiration.

590
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,440
To them,

591
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,480
you represent change for our country.

592
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,940
Meeting you in person,

593
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,820
they'll grow even more fond of you
and offer greater support.

594
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,140
Thank you, Uncle.

595
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,320
But I will have my guards

596
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,800
discreetly protect you from a distance.

597
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,800
I hope you do not mind.

598
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,720
I'd like you to stay by my side today.

599
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,290
I don't want you too far from me.

600
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Why?

601
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,960
Afraid I'll disappear on you?

602
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,080
We have to stay alert all the time.

603
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,840
I don't want to risk you getting hurt.

604
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,270
Public places can be unpredictable.

605
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,360
What happened in Davichmetha
might happen again.

606
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,260
I know,

607
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,780
but I also want to stand
with the people.

608
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,400
You understand me, right?

609
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,320
I want to use my title
to truly make a difference.

610
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,120
[Your prosperity comes
at the cost of our suffering]

612
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,240
[We deserve air to breathe,
not dust in our lungs]

613
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,480
It's turned off?

614
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,100
Thank you.

615
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,300
Let me know if you need help.
[Say no to lung cancer]

616
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,860
Thank you.

617
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,460
- Hey, Jay.
- What?

618
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,100
Prince Khanin's joining us.

619
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,680
He is?

620
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,600
Yeah.

621
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,880
He has...

622
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,520
visited our university.

623
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,650
Oh...

624
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,720
- Oh, right.
- Oh, right.

625
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,000
Wait, this is gonna be fun.

626
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
Come with me.

627
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,180
Come on, Jay.

628
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
Hurry.

629
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:20,800
Quick!

630
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,520
Prince Khanin...

631
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,320
May I join you, too?

632
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:34,270
But...

633
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,800
I wanted to help.

634
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

635
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,560
Then...

636
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,660
Please proceed this way.

637
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
This way.

638
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,360
Dear everyone who loves Emmaly,

639
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,360
let us sing with all our voices,

640
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,640
so those in power hear us
loud and strong.

641
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,040
Okay?

642
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,880
Okay!

643
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,560
- Yay!
- Okay?

644
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,880
Let those in power

645
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,920
recognize the hardships we endure.

646
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,040
Let this song turn Emmaly's fate

647
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,440
toward a brighter tomorrow.

648
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,080
Exactly!

649
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,920
♫Hard to see the road ahead♫

650
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,240
♫Through the quiet dread♫

651
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,160
♫The mist is thick,♫

652
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,320
♫The sky is dead♫

653
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,800
♫With our fading breath♫

654
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,440
♫Keep your eyes open wide♫

655
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:35,200
♫Every soul deserves to breathe♫

656
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,920
♫Don't walk away from silent cries♫

657
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,800
♫Each heart longs to live♫

658
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,000
♫Whispers in the mist♫

659
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,800
♫Always echo, never quit♫

660
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,400
♫We rise inside the mist♫

661
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,440
♫They don't see, but we persist♫

662
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:04,880
- ♫Whispers in the mist♫
- Louder!

663
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,640
- Sing it clearly!
- ♫Always echo, never quit♫

♫Even shadows can resist♫

665
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,880
♫Hear whispers in the mist♫

666
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,120
The Assavadevathins

667
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,280
are knowingly taking innocent lives.

668
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,720
Ran,

669
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,840
stop it.

670
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,240
I want to talk to him.

671
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,440
Your Royal Highness...

672
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,880
Your Royal Highness!

673
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,160
What did you mean by that?

674
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,780
The mine in Assavadevathin...

675
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,600
It killed my parents.

676
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,880
That mine has blood on its hands.

677
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,480
The King is killing more people!

678
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,000
You're all so damn selfish.

679
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,240
Your mine does nothing
but spread toxic dust.

680
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,840
We're dying out here.

681
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,880
Do you even care?

682
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,800
If it weren't for your greed,

683
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,680
my parents would still be here.

684
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,200
- Hey...
- Hey!

685
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,000
Just take it easy!

686
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,830
Stop!

687
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,360
Come on, calm down.

688
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,760
Hey, you're going too far.

689
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,760
Think you can do anything to me, huh?

690
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,200
You're hurting us!

691
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,310
You're harming your people!

692
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,480
You're harming us!

693
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,840
Things are starting to go wrong.

694
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,760
We need to go.

695
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,240
Hey, don't be violent!

696
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,800
Don't hurt them!

697
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,520
Stop!

698
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,320
- Calm down!
- Take it easy.

699
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,560
Just calm down.

700
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,560
Don't be violent.

701
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,680
Hey!

702
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,520
Stop!

703
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,540
Don't hurt them.

704
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,680
Calm down! Stop!

705
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,400
He didn't harm me, Uncle.

706
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,760
We were the ones who went too far.

707
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,200
He nearly lost his life
from suffocation.

708
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,920
You can't really tell

709
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,280
who's on which side.

710
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,240
Your Royal Highness!

711
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,520
Trust no one

712
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,280
but yourself, Nin.

713
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,880
Not even me.

714
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,640
Your Royal Highness...

715
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,160
- Please...
- Sorry to bother your personal time.

716
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,160
I can't even trust

717
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,400
my own family.

718
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,080
Come closer.

719
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,240
I'll let you have a bite.

720
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
I enjoyed our stroll today.

721
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,760
Can you take me here often?

722
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,560
If nothing's in my way,

723
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,240
I will.

724
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,120
Next time, let's bring this along
as a snack,

725
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,320
so we can eat it anywhere.

726
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,160
♫The only love I've longed for,♫

727
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,760
♫Just the word "love" from you,
