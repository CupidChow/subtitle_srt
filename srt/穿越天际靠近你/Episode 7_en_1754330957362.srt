00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
your nephew is going to play some mischief to squeeze applauding

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,600
It's an excellent idea

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,980
to come out of this校

4
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,000

5
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,360

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,780

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,840

Please take care of me

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,640

!!

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Dad died withter,

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,900
so I can't tell you clearly now.

16
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,540
Is everything guys say true or not?

17
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,420
Yes, dad.

18
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,740

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
I fell asleep and didn't know what to do.

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,540
Where have you been?

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Did you have fun?

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
See you tomorrow.

24
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,900
You really chose the right place.

25
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Go to bed.

26
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm sleepy.

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Let me take you to bed.

28
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Go.

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
Okay.

30
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
I'm going to bed.

31
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
I'm going to bed.

32
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
I'm going to bed.

I'm going to bed.

34
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm going to bed.

35
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
I'm going to bed.

36
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
I'm going to bed.

37
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
I'm going to bed.

38
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
I'm going to bed.

39
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm going to bed.

40
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,900
I'm going to bed.

41
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
I'm going to bed.

42
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm going to bed.

43
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm going to bed.

44
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
I'm going to bed.

49
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I'm going to bed.

50
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm going to bed.

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm going to bed.

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I'm going to bed.

53
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm going to bed.

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm going to bed.

55
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm going to bed.

56
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,900
The Long Ballad

57
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Episode 18

58
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,900
The Long Ballad

59
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Sis.

60
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
You're awake?

61
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Do you remember what you did last night?

62
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Settle down!

63
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,860
Seriously,

64
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,900
you're late!

65
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,100
Do you know who I am?

66
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,740
Of course.

67
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,340
Do you know that I'm the prince?

68
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,540
I think you're too drunk, Kawin.

69
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,740
Sis, can you drive me home?

70
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,380
Huh?

71
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Hey, Kawin.

72
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,860
I'm sorry

73
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,620
for making you feel so hot.

74
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,340
It's okay.

75
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,340
We're friends now.

76
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,780
You were so drunk last night.

77
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,500
You didn't know what to say.

78
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
I didn't know who you were with.

79
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,660
By the way,

80
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,620
what are you doing here?

81
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,420
I'm here to see my friend.

82
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you sure?

83
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,900
I'm here to see my friend.

84
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,140
Oh,

85
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,140
when you were still awake,

86
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,500
I went out to buy some food.

87
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,100
Aw.

88
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,180
iler.

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,300
The house you're staying in

90
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,780
is very huge.

91
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,780
And, it looks so good.

92
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,140
I wonder

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,100
if you're

94
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,220
a rich Shi Pao fighter abroad.

95
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,020
Or

96
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,380
a middle-class trirumphant boy?

97
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,220
Do you really believe me?

98
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,180
That's the plot of the series.

99
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,340
If you were really the prince,

100
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,700
we wouldn't be so close.

101
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,940
You would have to

102
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,660
meet rich people,

103
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,220
businessmen,

104
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,220
or high-ranking officials like me.

105
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Right?

106
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,540
This place is good.

107
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,980
Do you want this one?

108
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,540
I bought this for you.

109
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,140
One member perspective

110
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,700
This.

111
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,380
You still don't know how to open a sandwich?

112
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,380
Tanes first.

113
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
I will try to find it.

114
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,420
But I haven't forgotten to return it to you.

115
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
I will return it to you when I get home.

116
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
Thank you.

117
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,420
But where is your house?

118
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,420
My house is in Minanakarin.

119
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
If there is a day off,

120
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,420
would you like to go there?

121
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,420
I will be your guide.

122
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
There is a fish there.

123
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
There is also a sea.

124
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,420
Let's go.

125
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I want to go.

126
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,420
I want to go.

127
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,420
I want to go.

128
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Then, I will see you when I get home.

129
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
Okay.

130
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
One moment.

131
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
What's up?

132
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,420
The train at 5 p.m. is leaving.

133
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Where are you going?

134
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Central Station.

135
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Are you still there?

136
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
I'm going.

137
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,420
See you.

138
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
I have to go with my friend.

139
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
I have to go to the forest fire

140
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
at the temple today.

141
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,420
Would you like to go with me?

142
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I want to apologize.

143
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I have something to do.

144
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Let's go after we finish eating.

145
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
Okay.

146
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,420
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Is it okay?

152
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
If you want to order anything,

153
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,420
please tell me.

154
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,420
I don't want anything.

155
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Don't be shy.

156
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
Just tell me.

157
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,840
Maybe I can follow you now.

158
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,900
Eat, please.

159
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,020
Do you want to write too, fishing now?

160
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,980
But you still need to save that fish

161
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,040
to make yours more expensive.

162
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,940
Yes, he always called me a guru.

163
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
Do you want to write a poem instead of me of him?

164
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,660
Young master,

165
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,580
I wish you a long New Year Там before you die.

166
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,620
Seize her time so that' s okay.

167
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,700
What time?

168
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,980
Which time are you going to go?

169
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,780
You...

170
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:26,820
You...

171
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,940
What do you want me here for?

172
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,780
don't mind me.

173
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,260
Why do you younger the song?

174
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,020
Yes, I understand.

175
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,140
I want to talk now about this...

176
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,020
on Twitch Meta.

177
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,500
That's ok.

178
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,060
Forget about him

179
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,100
for now

180
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,780
We just need to be careful

181
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,820
Thank you so much, Your Majesty

182
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,020
Your Majesty

183
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
For what?

184
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,700
I don't dare to column against my daughter

185
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,300
That's something I can't confirm

186
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,780
But I've seen how madam dressed

187
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,820
and it's not good for our Boris Ah Sai's Everglow people.

188
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,060
In the past two years,

189
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,820
the first scene never performed well.

190
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,820
I noticed various rumours from our viewers

191
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,380
and their displeasure about watching

192
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,260
some people gettingcribed by someone else.

193
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,460
I think they came here to insult us

194
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,820
and test us,

195
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,660
because it'll be easier

196
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,740
if they're critical,

197
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,580
cause either there'll be someone else

198
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,020
or there'll be some other possibilities.

199
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,380
So we got to be careful

200
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,900
You said,

201
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,940
we didn't know what happiness is all about because of the diet.

202
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,060
Have you done any research?

203
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,340
I looked into the direction of your flow state of mind.

204
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,580
So the rest,

205
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,220
we will have to act before taking a step from our adamant.

206
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,740
Anyone else want to talk with me?

207
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,980
All right, adults are all here.

208
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,760
Good pet 너

209
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,960
Well,

210
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,620
what?

211
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Why did you switch disconnecting power off

212
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,920
andAPPLAUSE all of a sudden?

213
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,380
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,380
Sir, something big happened.

215
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,380
I know that you're smart enough to know why I called you here.

216
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
I know.

217
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm sorry for making you feel so embarrassed.

218
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Sir.

219
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
Please wait for me.

220
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
Taking her to that place is not a good idea.

221
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,380
I order you to be sent to the place where you will be responsible for taking care of her.

222
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,380
You don't have to risk your life.

223
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,380
You can't go back to the place where you were sent to.

224
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
I know that.

225
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,380
If you havecejing, I'm okay.

226
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
If you don't like someone, then I could do it for you.

227
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
them.

228
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,380
But how about this thatanned.

229
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
What's wrong with him and equip?

230
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,380
You must deal withutes these two teachers in this grouped.

231
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,580
You angry?

232
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:44,680
What are they thinking

233
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,220
I don't want to lose

234
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,340
Dongcong...

235
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,260
Dongcong, you do have...

236
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
You...

237
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,260
village chief Ma...

238
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,060
scammer Ma signature...

239
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,980
yeah, that's me...

240
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,680
snack time...

241
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,820
You have to forget it.

242
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,180
Kanin isn't hot about more.

243
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,220
But you'd know we're doing this,

244
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,420
because of his qualifiedAAA.

245
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm not sure if I can be your master.

246
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Sir.

247
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Don't be angry.

248
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
If you can't do it,

249
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
why would you be my master?

250
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Please go back to your seat.

251
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
The water is boiling.

252
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Don't let the boat get stuck.

253
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
I'm still standing.

254
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Even if you're my master,

255
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
don't forget that

256
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,220
your life is the most important thing.

257
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
Can you try again?

258
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Sure.

259
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,220
Our armadillo chief said

260
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,220
he's doing the coaching of Mr.Kanin

261
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
for the same time.

262
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
Charan has been returned to his ice receive city.

263
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,220
I don't want to see him.

264
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,220
You don't want your nephew to meet with other people.

265
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
You are too high.

266
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I think this is a good opportunity

267
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
to let us be with him.

268
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,220
And we can be with the new coach.

269
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,220
The new athlete is our man.

270
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,220
So I have done it properly.

271
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
And how is the result?

272
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,220
Have you chosen your life?

273
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,220
It's good news.

274
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
Good.

275
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Let him report about the case all the time.

276
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,220
I won't let you miss.

277
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Only one person.

278
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
The final result

279
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
will be announced in the final round.

280
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:27,220
The winner will get 10

281
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
10 pointers in the trial.

282
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
I am the coach Jo K invitation card.

283
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
I used to be a teammate.

284
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,220
And I'm widely known

285
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,220
and the ability to fly like a bow.

286
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:57,340
The左手跟右手 hesitation

287
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,640
and the potential to do v-th coordinated action.

288
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,340
In particular,

289
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,980
You should have told us.

290
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,860
But you told us to mind our own business.

291
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,940
You also asked us to forego your 90% of that.

292
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,500
What is it?

293
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,980
You told us to do that

294
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,140
before giving us a chance to deal with the Chu plaintiff.

295
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,340
Why?

296
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,220
I'll ask you now.

297
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,860
Let me ask you.

298
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,140
Yes, I can ask you.

299
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,340
Please tell me.

300
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I'm мог.

301
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,980
Can I help you?

302
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,380
Yes.

303
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,740
I expect so much for our future together

304
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,140
Can I leave it in your hands for the investigation?

305
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,340
Where Serendipity is at now and what's going on?

306
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,020
And if they do find it out,

307
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,820
we'll be very sorry

308
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,100
Yes, Your Majesty

309
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,860
I know.

310
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,300
You know about your new coach.

311
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,860
You're okay, right?

312
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
I'm okay.

313
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,420
My father is in the capital today.

314
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,540
He has something to do.

315
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,980
I'm worried about my son.

316
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,020
So I came here to tell you about him.

317
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,060
Thank you, my father.

318
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,460
Please forgive my father for me,

319
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:55,840
for

320
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,980
causing shit to your life.

321
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,460
Actually,

322
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
You're smart enough to protect your daughter.

323
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,140
But when she's gone,

324
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,780
you don't know who you can trust anymore.

325
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,380
Being a man

326
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,060
who has the duty to compete in the national competition

327
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,740
is not easy.

328
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,700
Here.

329
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,500
You must be careful all the time.

330
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,700
Here.

331
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,100
My lady,

332
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,300
I'm living in Nefsati's friend zone.

333
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,900
I understand the task.

334
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,580
Please wait for me a little while.

335
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,060
I'm sureGr viel Leben should understand the task.

336
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,980
Teyvah.

337
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,420
Your highness,

338
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,380
Luobo, the son of Lu Yi,

339
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,660
will be in prison tonight.

340
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,180
Let's wait for her.

341
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,260
Ok, the child is small.

342
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,460
That's the Sixth animation director's daughter.

343
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,020
Hope that he andnie Gu細 can be together.

344
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,300
She looked like Lu Yi.

345
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,900
You're a woman.

346
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,900
You must accept this.

347
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,940
I do.

348
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,900
What about you?

349
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,020
Do you accept it?

350
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,580
Or are you always disappointed

351
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,100
that there's a woman in your family?

352
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,680
This girl forced me to leave affirm Dreamängt

353
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
and now

354
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,080
I'll prove myself to my father.

355
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,100
Waha

356
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
I'm here.

357
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
Mr. Wirun,

358
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,300
I want to take a few minutes to bother you.

359
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
Can you tell me the location of Mr. Charan's office?

360
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm sorry, I'm busy.

361
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
I'm busy.

362
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Can you tell me the location of Mr. Charan's office?

363
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Why do you want to know?

364
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
The order of the Lord of the Universe

365
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,300
is to leave the place without Mr. Charan meeting with the young master.

366
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,300
I'm not the young master.

367
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Oh, Mr. Wirun, I really want to meet Mr. Charan.

368
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Can you tell me the location of Mr. Charan's office?

369
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
It's been two minutes.

370
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Can I go now?

371
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Where are you going?

372
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Are you going to see Mr. Charan?

373
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Do you want me to go with you?

374
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Can I give you a ride?

375
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Mr. Wirun, I'm busy.

376
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Mr. Wirun, Mr. Wirun.

377
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Go.

378
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
Oh, wait.

379
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Whose is this?

380
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,300
It's Mr. Wirun's.

381
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,300
Oh, Mr. Wirun.

382
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Yes.

383
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Oh, there are Thai snacks.

384
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,300
I just found out that Mr. Wirun likes to eat Thai snacks.

385
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I'm sorry.

386
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,300
I'm sorry.

387
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm sorry.

388
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm sorry.

389
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm sorry.

390
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm sorry.

391
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I'm sorry.

392
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,300
I'm sorry.

394
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm sorry.

395
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm sorry.

396
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm sorry.

397
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,300
I'm sorry.

398
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Long Chinese Allah

400
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Chakri.

401
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Mr. Chak is 22 just fainted.

402
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
How do you find me?

403
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
You've been looking for someone, right?

404
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Uncle, he is very thin.

405
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
That he asks me to find you.

406
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Thank you.

407
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
And,

408
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I'm sorry for your loss.

409
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Please tell the priest not to worry about me.

410
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
Let him practice hard.

411
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
And be careful.

412
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Be careful?

413
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
There are so many coaches in this country.

414
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,300
Finally, this person is free to teach the young master alone.

415
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I think the new coach

416
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
may be related to the development of the young master and the ministry.

417
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Yes, I will take care of the young master.

418
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,300
And I won't tell the young master that you are here.

419
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
You are here.

420
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
But,

421
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
I have a question.

422
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Are you really okay to be here?

423
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
I like to be here.

424
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,300
I just can't go out for a while.

425
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
You never seriously punish me.

426
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
The reason is

427
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm afraid that I will be punished.

428
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Are you ready to go inside?

429
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Yes.

430
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Mr.Klee,

431
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Please take care of Mr.Sai Kanin closely.

432
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Yes.

433
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
I will take care of it.

434
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
You are very good.

435
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:12,980
J macca

436
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,060
The most important thing for JOHNny

437
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,180
is cold

438
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,380
I'm toll.

439
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,240
Right?

440
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,240
We should practice more.

441
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,480
Hello Uncle Tai,

442
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,460
nice to meet you.

443
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,720
Your hand is not very good today, Reyn aggiimmg?

444
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,680
It has sprained handsome, large celebrate

445
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,600
as you said he's not very good condition to see presents sent by the processors.

446
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Of course it hurts.

447
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm still glad to see how you are street-herding our van,

448
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm very happy to see how everything is working out for you

449
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,280
I want to tell you that

450
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
you should be worried about him.

451
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
You should train him well.

452
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
And you should be careful of him.

453
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,960
I can't go to see him, right?

454
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,360
If you insist on going to see him,

455
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,800
someone will know about it.

456
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,720
This time,

457
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,760
you may be punished more severely.

458
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,440
So please don't tell him right away

459
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,280
and ask your parents to help.

460
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,080
You are truly safe.

461
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,120
Spread your hands!

462
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:17,580
Harder!

463
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,040
Please give me a new one

464
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
Please give me a new one

465
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,340
Take a rest

466
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,820
Give me a new one

467
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,500
Three Baht

468
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,000
New one

469
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,920
New one

470
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Again.

471
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Again.

472
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Again, Your Majesty.

473
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Enough, Your Majesty.

474
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Your Majesty, you will get hurt.

475
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Come on, I'll help you.

476
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
I just stopped practicing.

477
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,760
But you still did a bad job, Your Majesty.

478
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
You only shot the target several times.

479
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I can't do it anymore. I'll practice later.

480
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Your Majesty.

481
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Who do you think you are?

482
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm sorry.

483
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
No one has ever been so stupid

484
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
to follow your orders like me.

485
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
No one is stupid to follow our words either.

486
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
I said I couldn't do it anymore.

487
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Do you want me to practice again and get hurt?

488
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
Your Majesty.

489
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
It's strange.

490
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
What do you think, Your Majesty?

491
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Since I was here,

492
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I've never felt this way

493
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
since I took the position of the prince.

494
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
I've never felt this way before.

495
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Your Majesty, you are now

496
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
a coach, right?

497
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Yes.

498
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Or do you feel the same way?

499
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
The way you talk and the way you look.

501
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
I don't think it's sincere.

502
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't think it's sincere.

503
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
I'm sorry.

504
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
But don't worry.

505
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,760
I won't let you do anything to him.

506
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
You can count on me.

507
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,760
So, let's start

508
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
the first lesson.

509
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Yes.

510
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

511
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Today, we will learn about

512
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
the history of Emmerich.

513
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Emmerich.

514
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
What else do we need to adjust?

515
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,760
The skill of shooting the arrow of the princess is excellent, Your Majesty.

516
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
But there are things that need to be adjusted.

517
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
The most important thing, Your Majesty.

518
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Even it's time to rest, you need to rest.

519
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
It's now.

520
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
But I don't think

521
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
I can do it.

522
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
I'm not sure.

523
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
But if I don't teach…

524
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Your Majesty, don't push yourself too hard.

525
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
No.

526
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
I don't want you to blame me.

527
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Especially in the competition.

528
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,760
I'm sorry.

529
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Let's practice shooting the arrow here.

530
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
So we can change the atmosphere.

531
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
So we won't be stressed.

532
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Because the arrow competition

533
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
will take place in the race.

534
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
So this kind of training

535
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
can help you a lot.

536
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
You come here to exercise, right?

537
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I knew it.

538
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
Your Majesty.

539
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I don't trust you.

540
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I don't trust you.

541
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
The arrow used today

542
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
is a little different from the previous one.

543
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I have adjusted some parts

544
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
to make it more suitable for you.

545
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I want to use the arrow I use every day.

546
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Let go.

547
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,760
Let go.

548
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Let go.

549
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Let go.

550
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,760
Let go.

551
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
Let go.

552
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
Let go.

553
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
Let go.

554
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
Let go.

555
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,760
Your Majesty, are you okay?

556
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,960
My Lord.

557
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
My Lord.

558
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
My Lord.

559
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,760
My Lord.

560
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,760
My Lord.

561
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,320
Doctor, come here.

562
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,400
Sir, what's wrong with him?

563
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,960
He's been practicing martial arts and is in a coma.

564
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,360
He must be practicing too much.

565
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,360

00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,220
results from the investigation.

576
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,580

But if you can't, I will help you.

599
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,940
Punishing someone is meaningless.

No matter how close the competition is,

609
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,940
I can't trust anyone.

610
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:23,940

00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,940

00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,940
I will follow the story as closely as possible.

614
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,940
I want to know who my enemy is.

615
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,940
I don't mind how to find him.

Who ordered you to do this?

620
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,940
It's a set up.

621
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,940
The result of the person who did the mistake

622
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
will not be told.

623
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,940
I didn't do anyone's work.

624
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
As you wish.

625
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,940
If it's ordered,

626
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,940
the Da Vin's group can't help.

627
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,940
If I tell you,

628
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,940
you will be punished.

629
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,940
I will be punished.

630
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,940
I will be punished.

631
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,940
I will be punished.

632
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,940
If I tell you,

633
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,940
What?

634
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,940
About my safety,

635
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,940
Keep an eye on him.

636
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,940
I will be there.

637
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,940
Let me see.

638
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,940
Any news about Mr.Kanin?

639
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,940
Now,

640
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,940
there is a court trial of Mr.Kanin.

641
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
But it's a secret.

642
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,940
Is he dead?

643
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
Faba,

644
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
why did you do this?

645
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,940
I was too scared.

646
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,940
I was worried about him.

647
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:13,940
If he died, he would be bored.

648
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
I'm sorry, Faba.

649
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,940
He was killed by a knife.

650
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,940
Where is our destiny?

651
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,940
Faba is dead.

652
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
What shall we do now?

653
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
Later.

654
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,940
Later.

655
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,940
Brother.

656
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,940
Let's go.

657
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,040
This is the end of the story.

658
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,040
We need to bring the truth to justice.

659
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,040
We need to bring the guilty to the punishment.

660
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
What's wrong with you?

661
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
How is your brother?

662
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,040
I think he's a little sick.

663
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,040
I'm sorry, Mom.

664
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,040
God has forbidden others from visiting him.

665
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:55,040
I think you can't...

666
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,040
I can...

667
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,040
I understand.

668
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
Yes.

669
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
Why do you act like you're someone else?

670
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Because I'm really someone else.

671
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,040

01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,600
Actually,

758
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,240
on the night of the wedding,

759
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,320
you always come to watch the Buddha.

760
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,720
I don't know what to say.

761
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,680
I don't know what to say.

762
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,440
I'll go and find you.

763
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,840
Goodbye.

764
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,360
I can wait anymore

765
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:50,560
until you're Quindiqu신

766
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,240
and back.

767
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
Father,

768
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
are you hurt?

769
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,240
If you didn't think of the mistake,

770
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,240
I would have died like your father.

771
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,240
I'm...

772
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
I'm worried about you.

773
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,240
I'm sorry.

774
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,240
Thank you.

775
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,240
It's my fault.

776
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,240
I made you face danger.

777
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
How can I blame you?

778
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,240
You were killed by the police.

779
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
But now,

780
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,240
you have the permission to come back to help me.

781
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Really?

782
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,240
That's good.

783
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,240
I think

784
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,240
I should go prepare the beautiful equipment

785
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
for you to use in the future.

786
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,240
Congratulations on your return.

787
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,240
You can smile now.

788
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,240
Always smile.

789
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,240
I'm sorry.

790
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,240
You really followed the secret that Mr.Kri told you.

791
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
I remember.

792
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
I'm sorry.

793
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,240

Really?

817
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
I'm glad

818
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,400
But I have to sleep now

819
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,400
Don't you blame me for this?

820
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,400
I'm sorry

821
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,400
Don't be a guard anymore

822

823
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Okay?

I want you to hold this

882
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,400
This

883
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
This

884
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,400
And

885
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,400
Do you want to hear it yourself?

886
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,400
Where did you come from?

887
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,400
I'm sorry

888
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,400

I'm sorry

891
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,400
I didn't recognize you

892
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,400
I'm sorry

893
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,400
I'm sorry

894
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,800
Are you sure that was really happening?

895
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,120
If I could do...

896
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,600
There's only me around here.

897
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,220
Hey.

898
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,180
We are the only one around.

899
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,720
Change with Lin.

900
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,400
What aboutgrunting yourself?

901
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,520
Yes.

902
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,480
The one facing you.

903
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,760
Let it go!

904
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,800
Let it go!

905
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,040
Whenever you feel like being a miss,

906
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,820
the most important thing for me is your therapy.

907
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,540
Has he ever liked or hated that I was insensitive?

908
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,100
Never.

909
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,800
I'm sorry.

910
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,800

I'm sorry.

920
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,800
I'm sorry.

921
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,800
I'm sorry.

922
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,800

I'm sorry.

926
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,800
I'm sorry.

927
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,800
I'm sorry.

928
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,800
I'm sorry.

929
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
I'm sorry.

930
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:34,800
I'm sorry.

931
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,800
I'm sorry.

932
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,800
I'm sorry.

933
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,800

I'm sorry.

935
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,800
I'm sorry.

936
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,800
I'm sorry.

937
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,800
I'm sorry.

938
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,800
I'm sorry.

939
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,800
I'm sorry.

940
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,800
I'm sorry.

941
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
I'm sorry.

942
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,800
I'm sorry.

943
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,800
I'm so sorry.

944
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,800
I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry.

946
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,800
I'm sorry.

947
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,800
I'm sorry.

948
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,800
I'm sorry, smokes.

949
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
I'm so sorry.

950
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,800
I'm so sorry.

951
