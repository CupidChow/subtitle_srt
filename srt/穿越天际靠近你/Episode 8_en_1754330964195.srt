1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Please take care of Mr. Saikanin closely.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sir, sir, sir.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sir, Sir Lek is safe now.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good thing that you came to help and noticed about the crime.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you so much, Sir.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You have been allowed to return to help the teacher and the students.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You really take care of me like a man.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I promise that I will protect you with my life.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
P'Lan.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why? Are you not used to it?

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Or do you miss what happened last night?

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please, help me.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please help me.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please help me.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want you to follow my heart.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will not follow your heart.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I will not follow your heart.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sir Kawin.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We are here to visit Mr. Saikanin.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please follow this way.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mr. Saikanin is not here to ask for help, right?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sir Kawin is really a good man.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am much better now.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My body and my heart.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you want to eat macaroni together?

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't mind. Please feel free to ask him.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is that all?

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I see you are strong. I am relieved.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Excuse me.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think he doesn't want to tell anyone.

32
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I think he thinks that there is nothing.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But after this, I want us to be more careful to get closer.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't see you need to be careful.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want to go to the park?

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you want to go to the park?

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not far.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who will do it?

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do as I say.

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go back to our room.

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go.

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go.

43
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's go.

44
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go.

45
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go.

46
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's go.

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

48
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's go.

49
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's go.

50
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go.

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's go.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

53
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's go.

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's go.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's go.

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Please rest.

59
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I will.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Jacqueline,

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I need something.

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Can you order it for me?

63
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, you mean low-land intense care treatment for hair like water or hair?

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But there is still water.

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I will add it all.

66
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But what I want to say is…

67
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is it, P'Pet?

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What is the sign of the Metha tribe?

69
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A bird.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right, a bird.

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What kind of bird is it?

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you have to know about the tribe?

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who knows what tribe it is?

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's probably the Mingos.

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you don't care,

77
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I think there may be a mistake in the competition.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
People don't know.

79
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you know, just tell me.

80
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's do this.

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If I answer wrongly again,

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I will be punished.

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I will be punished.

84
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What do you want me to punish?

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hmm.

86
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I want you to be punished.

87
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If I answer wrongly again,

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
would you kiss me?

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If I get the wrong answer, you kiss me.

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And what is the punishment?

92
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Punishment.

93
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You only have the advantage and the disadvantage.

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I am not the one who kisses you.

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But you are the one who kisses me.

96
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why?

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because at that time…

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's it.

99
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This is just a kiss.

100
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's focus on studying.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is the ancient city of Emily?

102
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The ancient city of Emily.

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You should be faster.

104
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Faster.

105
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come on.

106
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I lost to you again.

107
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not fun.

108
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now you are back to the show before you can perform again.

109
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm just doing what I should do.

121
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You need to be more conscious.

122
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
When you focus on winning, the secret is losing.

123
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let me ask you.

127
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are the son of a life-giving monk.

128
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You must be so good at sharpening the sword.

129
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm a god-like family.

130
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I have to practice sharpening the sword since I was a kid.

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why?

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
My family has a duty to be the king of the gods.

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But why does your family have to be the king of the gods

134
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
since the day you became the king of the gods?

135
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So it's a duty to be the king of the gods.

136
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you don't ask for the sword,

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
you must be the king of the gods.

138
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It depends on the order of the king.

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I may be the king of the gods or not.

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You take care of me so well

141
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
because of the deal of the Buddhist temple?

142
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you mean that?

143
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If it's a duty, I must do my best.

144
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What about this?

145
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If it's a duty, I think you know it well from all my actions.

146
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a reward for your love.

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm so tired. I don't want to sharpen my sword anymore.

149
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You still do it like me.

150
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Let's find something to do.

151
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What's up?

152
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I heard that it's fun.

153
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's fun for sure.

154
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Try to hold it.

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't be afraid. I never hurt anyone.

156
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You?

157
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is called Diren. Try to hold it.

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's get to know each other first so we can get to know each other better.

159
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You are so familiar with the dog.

160
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I raised it by myself. How can I not be close to it?

161
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Who is close to the dog?

162
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who is close to the dog?

163
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Have you introduced yourself to Diren?

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Huh? Do I have to introduce myself to the dog?

165
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, so we can get close quickly.

166
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Fine.

167
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Diren, my name is Nin.

168
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm Nin.

169
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm Nin.

170
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't kick me.

171
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm here for this.

172
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's be friends.

173
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Are you teasing me?

174
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Are you teasing me?

175
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you teasing me?

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, I'm not.

177
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hold this tight.

178
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then step on my left foot on the circle.

179
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And put yourself on the roof.

180
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Try it.

181
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hold the line now.

182
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hold the line.

183
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hold the line.

184
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't be nervous.

185
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm not nervous.

186
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you're scared, tell me.

187
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm here for you. You shouldn't be scared.

188
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's not easy to do it رiş fifth that you have to get close to, so talk about loving each other.

189
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because you've been caught after we and Min Y Braden fell off the cliff.

190
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's enough, I'm scared because I'll fall.

191
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If you're afraid of us,

192
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want you to hug me.

193
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you want me to hug you, tell me.

194
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you know, hug me.

195
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's good to be together like this.

196
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's been a long time since I was like this.

197
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Next time, I will fight hard. I don't want you to be stressed.

198
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's okay to be stressed. I have you.

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We are together forever.

200
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will do whatever I can do for you.

201
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I will take care of you as best as I can.

202
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I love you.

203
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Don't be afraid. You are here.

204
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I want you to take a break.

205
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I let you take a break for a while.

206
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But I never had the chance to give you a break.

207
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I love you.

208
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I want you to take a break.

209
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I want you to take a break when it rains.

210
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So you don't have to be afraid of anything.

211
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want you to go through bad days.

212
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like when I had nothing left, I had you here with me.

213
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Thank you.

214
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You don't have to be afraid or worried anymore.

215
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Because you will be by my side.

216
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Are you getting bored of Emily already?

217
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Not at all.

218
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I like Emily.

219
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And the more friends I have at the university, the more fun it is.

220
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thank you for liking our country.

221
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
How is your father?

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He is a good Buddhist monk.

223
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
If you want me to help you, you can tell me. I'm glad to help.

224
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,500
Thank you.

225
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm glad to help.

226
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
You talked about studying. How was your study?

227
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Did you take good care of him?

228
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I took good care of him.

229
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,500
During this break,

230
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
my friend asked me to visit his birthplace in Minan.

231
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,000
I see.

232
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
You're here. Let's have a meal together.

233
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
If you need help, just let me know.

234
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,500
The young monk Kawin just told me that he would visit Minanakarin.

235
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Minanakarin or what?

236
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
I want to go with you.

237
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,500
I just learned about the dark champagne egg.

238
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I want to see the real thing naturally.

239
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
So, are you interested in traveling with me?

240
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes.

241
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Can I go with you?

242
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Sure. I'll go with you.

243
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
I haven't visited Minanakarin for a long time.

244
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay.

245
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Please help me.

246
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Why don't you ride a bike with me today?

248
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
I'm sorry.

249
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,500
But I have a sore muscles today.

250
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I'm tired of riding a bike.

251
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm tired of the sharp teeth.

252
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,500
But if the young monk knows that you haven't practiced, he will…

253
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
My father will never know about this.

254
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Trust me.

255
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,500
The close ones have to endure.

256
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
You can take the punishment.

257
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Stop.

258
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,000
Father.

259
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,000
Sir.

260
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,000
Stop.

261
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,000
Stop.

262
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't touch me.

263
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,000
Father, stop.

264
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,000
Father, please.

265
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,000
Let go.

266
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,000
Stop.

267
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,000
Let go of me.

268
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,000
Father.

269
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,000
Sir.

270
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Sampet.

271
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's not my fault.

272
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,500
Sir.

273
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

274
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,500
What?

275
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let go of me.

276
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,500
Sir.

277
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,500
Stop.

278
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Sir.

279
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Sir.

280
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,500
Are you crazy?

281
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,500
Sir.

282
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm not.

283
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,500
Come here.

284
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,500
Khun Tine.

285
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,500
Let go of me.

286
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,500
I said stop.

287
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,500
Son.

288
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Help.

289
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Who ordered you to stop?

290
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,500
I…

291
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,500
I…

292
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm taking a rest.

293
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You disobeyed the order of the king.

294
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,500
Stop.

295
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't mess with the stage.

296
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,500
This is our order.

297
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The most respected sir.

298
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Take it out.

299
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,500
Sir.

300
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Please don't help me.

301
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
If you want to follow me,

302
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I will be punished harder.

303
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,500
No.

304
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,500
Hurry.

305
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Don't come to take the punishment.

306
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm here to take the punishment.

307
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Because the duty of the close person of the sir

308
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
is to take the punishment.

309
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Come with me.

310
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I believe that you will protect me.

311
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
I'm sorry.

312
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm sorry.

313
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,500
I'm sorry.

314
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm sorry.

315
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm sorry.

318
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,500
I'm sorry.

319
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm sorry.

320
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,500
I'm sorry.

321
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,500
I'm sorry.

323
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm sorry.

324
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,500
I'm sorry.

325
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,500
I'm sorry.

326
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm sorry.

327
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,500
I'm sorry.

328
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,500
I'm sorry.

329
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,500
I'm sorry.

330
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,500
I'm sorry.

331
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,500
I'm sorry.

332
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Are you done?

333
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Then you two,

334
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
take this bag

335
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
and those two bags

336
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and put them in front of the door.

337
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,500
I'm sorry.

338
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm sorry.

339
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm sorry.

340
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,500
I'm sorry.

341
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,500
I'm sorry.

342
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,500
I'm sorry.

343
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,500
I'm sorry.

344
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,500
I'm sorry.

345
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,500
I'm sorry.

346
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,500
I'm sorry.

347
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm sorry.

348
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm sorry.

349
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm sorry.

350
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,500
What's wrong with you?

351
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You know you have to go to a new city

352
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
in your most favorite clothes and.

353
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Have you brought my cloud intense care drink to you?

354
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,000
I have everything ready.

355
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,000
Sorry, Phra藩.

356
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'd like to invite you to follow the living god.

357
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Uncle, I want to discuss about the money with you.

358
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I think we should wait for the living god to come back to us.

360
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I have something to discuss with the father of the little boy.

361
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
When he arrives, he will know that it's an accident.

362
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No, it's a small thing. Don't make it a big deal.

363
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Here.

364
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
How are you, sir?

371
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'm fine. I just fell. Don't worry.

372
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You have a wound on your wrist and a fever.

373
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The medical department says you shouldn't go out.

374
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Being sick is a natural habit.

375
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It can happen.

376
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
But I hope that the treatment will be as usual.

377
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Otherwise, we will lose the opportunity to talk to the living god.

378
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I want to rest a little.

379
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Please be quick to leave the invitation.

380
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Please take care of Khun Kanin and Khawin.

381
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
They are on their way to meet the guests.

382
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I will take care of both of them and the family.

383
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Please be quick to leave the invitation.

384
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Thank you.

385
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's an honor that all of you have been standing here for a long time.

386
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
It's an honor too, Your Majesty.

387
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Please take the prince to rest.

388
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Khawin can do whatever he wants.

389
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I have something to tell you.

390
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

391
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm so glad that you came to visit this time.

392
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I want to learn about the history of the Minanakarin Temple

393
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
and want to see the color of the champagne.

394
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I would like to disturb you.

395
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
No, it's not a bother.

396
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I want to go to the city for a trip like a normal person.

397
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Can I practice like a normal person?

398
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I am very happy to do as you asked.

399
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You are the most important heir of the divine kingdom.

400
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And this time, Khawin also appeared.

401
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I can't ignore it.

402
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I want you to ask your people to keep your feet on the road.

404
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You won't mind, right?

405
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Please go.

406
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
If your son is still alive, he will be as old as you.

407
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
We will rest now.

409
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, okay.

410
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Your Majesty.

411
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
If you want something, call me anytime.

412
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Ram,

413
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
you should sleep with me.

414
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I can't.

415
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
You can't.

416
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You can't.

417
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You want to be with me, right?

418
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I want to be with you too.

419
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
But I don't think it's appropriate here.

420
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Why?

421
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
No one will be suspicious.

422
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
The love nest must be with the king.

423
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Believe me.

424
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I won't be stubborn.

425
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Rest well.

426
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We will go out together tomorrow.

427
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's good to sit in a car like this.

428
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's suitable for daily use.

429
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Do you remember that we used to sit in this car?

430
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There are two cars?

431
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yes.

432
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You are good at driving.

433
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You know how to use it in that situation.

434
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I know you use it in that situation.

435
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Are you there yet?

436
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes.

437
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Let's go out.

438
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hey,

439
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
what's up?

440
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Nothing.

441
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I just want to say hello to my friend.

442
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Do you have a friend who works in the industry?

443
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
He is my friend, Morphe.

444
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I work with him here.

445
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I went home after school.

446
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Do you want to go to see him?

447
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Let's meet up later.

448
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Okay?

449
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The king has made it clear that…

450
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You can send someone to the border.

451
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
The border.

452
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Don't be stressed. We are here to travel.

453
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I understand you.

454
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can send someone to the border.

455
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Thank you very much.

456
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Let's go.

457
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Hey, why are there only shops here?

458
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
There are no women.

459
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There are many people here.

460
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I think men should find a family.

461
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Women should take care of their homes.

462
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Right?

463
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Why do you still believe in this stuff?

464
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
If men don't want to work,

465
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
why don't women want to live in their homes?

466
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Why don't we let everyone do what they want to do?

467
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Why do we have to force ourselves to be stubborn?

468
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Why are you quiet?

469
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I agree with these beliefs.

470
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I just think that belief is the hardest thing to change.

471
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But it doesn't mean that it can't be changed.

472
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Right?

473
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes.

474
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
But it takes time.

475
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Let's go see.

476
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You can put the heart on the heart.

477
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You can check it first.

478
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Let's go inside.

479
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You can check it first.

480
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Do you want to see the egg with the color of the champagne?

481
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The last piece is just right.

482
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I see the real thing.

483
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It's beautiful.

484
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
What are you doing with a piece of egg like this?

485
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm going to make a necklaces.

486
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
One middle piece will make the egg and the dress look good.

487
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You have to find a shop to make the necklace.

488
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'll take care of the necklace.

489
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Thank you.

490
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
It's beautiful.

491
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
It's beautiful.

492
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I'll take one.

493
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Thank you.

494
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
June.

495
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
June.

496
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Is she your sister?

497
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm Kawin.

498
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Are you okay?

499
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Are you okay?

500
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Are you okay?

501
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Kawin is here.

502
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Take him to go out.

503
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm not going home.

504
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I can't leave you alone.

505
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I can stay.

506
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm fine.

507
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I'm in a hurry.

508
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
You can stay with June.

509
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
You can take him to go out.

510
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm fine.

511
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I've come back this time.

512
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I've been thinking about this more than I thought.

513
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I never thought that a person who is still young could get sick because of you.

514
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I understand why you like to be in the same group as Nalong.

515
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Actually, it's not just about June getting sick.

516
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Actually, my father died because he was seriously ill.

517
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And since he died, we moved out of the Wateen Milk Group.

518
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
At first, I joined the Nalong Group

520
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
because I wanted to help my family with my father and June.

521
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
But when I actually joined,

522
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I felt that if I didn't help them,

523
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I would have to have many people like my father and June.

524
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If we all stay quiet, it won't be useful to us.

525
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
How can the person who can handle this problem see the problem?

526
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I think the person who has the power wants to help the rest of the community.

527
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
If you really want to help, why don't you see the situation?

528
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
If you really want to help, you must see a way to solve the problem.

529
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Will you come with me tomorrow?

530
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yes.

531
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Will you come with me?

532
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Go ahead.

533
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Thank you for understanding me.

534
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We are friends.

535
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Friends must be happy together, right?

536
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I never thought that you would like me this much.

538
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You are so strict and quiet.

539
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I understand. But I can do everything in your heart.

540
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I have to do it myself.

541
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I know. It's my duty.

542
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Doing your duty, being strict is your duty.

543
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But you like each other. It's your duty, right?

544
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You understand me, right?

545
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yes.

546
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I will try to understand.

547
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Will you sleep with me tonight?

548
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
No.

549
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm full. I'm bored.

550
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Let's have dinner together.

551
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Please. Just have dinner. It's okay.

552
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Let's have dinner.

553
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay.

554
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Please have a seat.

555
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
How was it? Did you like it?

556
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The city of Sred Rung is very beautiful. The weather is good.

557
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
If you like it, you must come here often. I'm glad to welcome you.

558
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Sred Rung, actually I have something to ask you.

559
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
What is it?

560
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I got this leaflet.

561
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I want to go to work and sing with the people.

562
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Sure. Newbies like your nephew very much.

563
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
They say that your nephew is a symbol of the change of our country.

564
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
If the people get close to your nephew,

565
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they will give the people a lot of admiration

566
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and support for your nephew.

567
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Thank you.

568
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
But I would like your people to follow you to protect you.

569
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
You don't mind, right?

570
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Today I want you to be close to me all the time.

571
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I will always be close to you.

572
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Why? Are you afraid that I will disappear?

573
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
You have to be careful all the time.

574
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't want you to be in danger.

575
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
If you go to the water,

576
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
you may have an accident like the one you mentioned on Twitter.

577
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I understand.

578
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
But you want to be with the people.

582
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You understand me, right?

583
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I want to use your status as a benefit to the people.

584
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Turn off the engine.

585
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Thank you.

586
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I have something to tell you.

587
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Thank you.

588
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
What's up?

589
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
What's up?

590
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Mr. Kanin is here to see you.

591
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
He's here too.

592
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah.

593
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
He used to come here to see me.

594
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He used to come here to see me.

595
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Yeah.

596
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I think this event is fun.

597
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Follow me.

598
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Let's go.

599
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Wait.

600
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Mr. Kanin, can I join you?

601
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm here to help you.

602
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Thank you.

603
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm here to help you.

604
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
If so,

605
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
this way, please.

606
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Follow me.

607
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Thank you.

608
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
My brothers and sisters in the Emory state,

609
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
let's sing loudly

610
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and let our voice reach the people up there.

611
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Let's sing together.

612
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Right?

613
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yes.

614
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Right?

615
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Let the powerful people

616
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
see our problem.

617
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Let this song change the future of Emory.

618
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yes.

619
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Let's sing together.

620
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Yes.

621
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yes.

622
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yes.

623
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,000
My brother and sister in the Re tragedy.

624
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
My brother and sister all broke down in thealed Holl utilizar.

625
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Poor people.

626
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Let's dance.

627
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
Me too.

628
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Even shadows can resist.

629
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Here whispers in the mist.

630
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The gods are trying to kill people.

631
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
P'Nan, stop.

632
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I want to talk to her.

633
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I…I…

634
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
What do you mean?

635
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
The gods are trying to kill people.

636
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Why did my parents die?

637
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The gods are trying to kill people.

638
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
The gods are trying to kill people.

639
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
You guys are talking nonsense.

640
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Your town is full of evil.

641
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
We are all going to die.

642
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Do you see that?

643
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
If it wasn't for you,

644
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
my parents wouldn't have died.

645
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
They wouldn't have died.

646
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Hey, Jarniat.

647
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Jarniat,

648
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
the god has passed away.

649
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
What can I do?

650
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
What did he do to the people?

651
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
The weather is bad.

652
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Is it good?

653
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The god has passed away.

654
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Stop.

655
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Jarniat,

656
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
stop.

657
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Wait.

658
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Stop.

659
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
We…

660
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
We didn't do anything like that to him.

661
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
If it touch him too much,

662
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
it will break his breathing.

663
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,480
because who will be on your side?

664
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,480
Stop!

665
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,560
Apart from me,

666
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,400
don't trust In too much.

667
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,760
But you.

668
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,760
Pachai!

669
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,320
I want someone to take care of the king's personal time.

670
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,320
Even the gods themselves.

671
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,560
I can't trust them.

672
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Here.

673
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Move over.

674
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'll feed you.

675
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,520
Today's trip was so much fun.

676
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,040
Can you take me there more often?

677
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
If you're free,

678
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,520
I'll take you there again.

679
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,520
Next time, let's go eat at Longthong.

680
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,520
So we can eat everywhere.

681
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,520
Can you hear me?

682
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,520
I need your love

683
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,520
Only one in my heart

684
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,520
Do you know

685
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,520
who loves you?

686
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,520
Only you

687
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:01,520
Oh, I need your love

688
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,520
Only you
