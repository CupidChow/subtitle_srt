Three weeks later

Directed by Kritsada Techanilobon

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Mom's friend asked me to visit her birthplace in Minah.

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,920
It's an honor for all of you to be here in Minah, my wife.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Do you want to go see your friend?

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Right? If we don't help Pupdam,

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,920
there will be many people who are like my father and P'June.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
But I want to be with the people.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Let's sing a song to raise our voice.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Let our voice reach the people.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,920
The God of the Earth wants to kill the people.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Let's go to the people.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Don't do it.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,920
God of the Earth

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
God of the Earth

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,920
God of the Earth

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,920
God of the Earth

18
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
God of the Earth

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,920
God of the Earth

20
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,920
God of the Earth

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,920
God of the Earth

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,920
The God of the Earth

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
God of the Earth wants to kill the people.

24
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
God of the Earth is going to kill people.

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Stop. Don't hurt him.

26
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Don't hurt him.

27
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Don't hurt him.

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Don't hurt him.

29
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
Don't hurt him.

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Kaning.

31
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Kaning's niece.

32
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Are you okay?

33
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm sorry for what happened today.

34
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Today's story probably made your niece lose her gift.

35
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
But I let people deal with the person who caused the trouble today.

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Deal with?

37
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Yes. Take him to the prison for the rest of his life.

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Punish him for hurting Kaning.

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
But they didn't do anything to me.

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
We did more than they did.

41
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
They almost died.

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I just want to know if what people said is true.

43
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Did the gods intentionally let people die?

44
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,920
No. It's my fault that my niece died.

45
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,920
The gods and my niece didn't do anything wrong.

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Let's stop talking about this.

47
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Here. I prepared a gift for you. I hope you like it.

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Open it.

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Open it.

50
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,920
Black jelly will protect the body and strengthen the body.

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,920
This is the local snack. I especially prepared for you.

52
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Try it.

53
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Thank you.

54
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
It's very delicious.

55
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I feel a little bit weak. Please take a rest.

56
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I understand. You can invite your niece to rest.

57
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
This incident has caused an impact on the gods.

58
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Don't be angry,?

59
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I know.

60
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Now we have to deal with the cause and close all channels.

61
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
There are only social media channels that cannot be controlled.

62
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
How is Kaning?

63
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,920
She looks a little bit tired. She's resting now.

64
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Take good care of her. Don't let anything happen to her.

65
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Otherwise, we will create new problems.

66
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Please answer the call.

68
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
What should we do?

69
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
We can't just let you stay in the palace.

70
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
You have to dress up, shave your beard and shoot arrows all day.

71
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
How can someone outside cause trouble?

72
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
That's not it.

73
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
The king and the gods will find a way to take you back.

74
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
I don't think so.

75
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
That's not it.

76
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,920
The king and the gods will find a way to take you back.

77
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
The duty of the king is to keep the city peaceful.

78
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Your duty is to compete in this competition.

79
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You have to be more careful about other things.

80
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I think the king and the gods will find a way to take you back.

81
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
I think you should be suspicious too.

82
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
You should believe me because I'm right.

83
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Everyone does it for themselves. Don't trust anyone.

84
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm warning you.

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Don't trust anyone.

86
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Even me.

87
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Why do you say that?

88
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
If you still can't believe it, who else will you have?

89
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I said it wrong.

90
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
I understand.

91
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
If one day you have to choose between me and duty,

92
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
you won't choose me, right?

93
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Not like that.

94
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
If I made a mistake today and something happened to you,

95
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
how would you be?

96
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,920
How can you be sure that I can protect you every time?

97
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I don't trust myself yet.

98
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm worried.

99
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm worried about you.

100
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Just admit that you're worried about me.

101
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,920
It's not that hard.

102
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
I'm really worried about you.

103
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,920
So don't take yourself to the risk again.

104
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I understand.

105
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I understand about duty too.

106
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
But don't be mean to me like you did just now.

107
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I accept your request.

108
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
I accept your request.

109
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Where are you taking it?

110
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
You have news about today, right?

111
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Let me see.

112
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Chakri, show me.

113
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Chakri, show me.

114
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm sorry.

117
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
I was scolded.

118
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
You don't have to apologize to me.

120
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Just do it.

121
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I don't think I have to read it anymore.

122
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I…

123
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Why don't you want me to read it?

124
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
What's wrong with you?

125
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Is what he told you about Muang really true?

127
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Is it true that someone died because of Asawatthewatin?

128
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
You don't want to answer that it's true, right?

129
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I understand.

130
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,920
Even Asawatthewatin himself, I can't trust him.

131
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm sorry.

132
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm sorry.

133
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
I want to know who's behind this.

134
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I have to find out who is behind this.

135
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I need the video of the victim who was shot.

136
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Yes, Mr. Ongkarak.

137
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
It's not funny.

138
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
There's one more thing.

139
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Have you read the letter I sent you?

140
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
I think it's just a fake letter that's just to distract you.

141
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
It might be.

142
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
But it's better to know who did it first, right?

143
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I want to find out who did it.

144
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Sure. If there's anything, I'll tell you.

145
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

146
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
That's all.

147
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,920
You're not feeling well.

148
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm fine.

149
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
It'll be better.

150
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Thank you so much, Doctor.

151
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
It's my pleasure.

152
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
How's your wound, Doctor?

153
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
It's much better.

154
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Don't worry.

155
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,920
But is there any wound in your wound?

156
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
It's okay.

157
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Thank you for worrying about me.

158
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
It's something that no one wants to happen.

159
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
You don't have to risk yourself.

160
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
It's dangerous.

161
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm sorry.

162
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I'm sorry.

163
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
It's dangerous.

164
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Don't do this again.

165
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I have something to ask you.

166
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
The story that the people talked about in the prayer book

167
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
about the angelic spirit.

168
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Angelic spirit?

169
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The story about the angelic spirit

170
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
with a proof.

171
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
What value does it have

172
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
that makes it interesting?

173
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
If there's no evidence,

174
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
what is the reason that the people are claiming about us?

175
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
It's politics.

176
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Politics is a complicated subject.

177
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Don't pay attention to it.

178
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Go do your job well.

179
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
If you think so,

180
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I understand, Doctor.

181
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
You should rest.

182
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I won't bother you anymore.

183
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm here.

184
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Sit down.

185
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
The tea smells so good.

186
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
It reminds me of the old days.

187
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
It's the best.

188
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
The taste is so good.

189
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I've already sent my grandson to bring it from England.

190
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,920
But sometimes, there's something bad that bothers me.

191
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
So the tea,

192
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
the taste of it,

193
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
disappears into thin air.

194
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I want you to contact Ton-Ait

195
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
so that we can cut the fire before he gets lost.

196
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
And be like before.

197
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I want it to be a secret.

198
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Don't reveal it to anyone.

199
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Sir Kanin,

201
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Sir Kawin is waiting for you at the ward.

202
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Is he here?

203
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
This way, please.

204
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,920
I saw the news that there's a woman in the ward.

205
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I feel uncomfortable.

206
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
How is he?

207
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Thank you for worrying about me.

208
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
But I'm fine.

209
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
The person who should be worried is the public.

210
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
But I feel bad

211
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
that I can't help you.

212
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm sorry.

214
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I can't help you.

215
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Sir Kawin didn't do anything wrong.

216
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Does he know you?

217
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
He studied at Morpheus.

218
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Are you close?

219
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I'm not sure if I can call it a close.

220
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Is this your room?

221
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
No.

222
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
I just want to know more about the meeting.

223
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I think Sir Kawin is close to you.

224
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Maybe we can talk.

225
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Is there anything you don't know?

226
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Nothing.

227
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
I have a feeling about something wrong with you.

228
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
A feeling?

229
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I covered for you that I'm the prince.

230
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I don't know how to tell him.

231
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
I don't have a good chance.

232
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
If you don't have a chance, just do it.

233
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I think you can handle the prince's level.

234
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
This kind of thing

235
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,920
is not good for someone who you feel special to know from others.

236
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Feel special?

237
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,920
If you don't feel special, you won't think about it, right?

238
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
I'm sorry.

239
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Sis.

240
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Can I talk to you?

241
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I can't make an appointment and I can't reach you.

242
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I…

243
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
I…

244
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,920
What?

245
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

246
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
An urgent matter?

247
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
It's so urgent that you can't tell me before?

248
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm sorry.

249
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Are you home yet?

250
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Yes.

251
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,920
I'm glad that I can go to the park with you today.

252
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
But about…

253
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,920
about tomorrow…

254
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Oh, I forgot.

255
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
You haven't sent me the money yet, have you?

256
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Just a moment.

257
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I'll send it to you.

258
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Okay.

259
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
I'll send it to you.

260
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay.

261
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Well…

262
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Is there anything?

263
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
No.

264
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
I know that I'm wrong.

265
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm sorry.

266
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
But I feel so good about you.

267
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
If it makes our relationship more clear,

268
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
should I say it?

269
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Do you know why I'm so mad at you?

270
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Because I was wrong about you.

271
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
You disappeared when I kissed you.

272
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
I didn't know what to do.

273
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
What should I do?

274
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
I didn't know what happened in the morning.

275
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Don't you think

276
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
I'm worried about you?

277
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
I'm sorry that I disappeared

278
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
and didn't tell you anything.

279
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
From now on, I won't make you feel like that again.

280
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I promise.

281
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,920
I promise.

282
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
If you can beat me,

283
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
I'll give you a reward tonight.

284
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,920
I can't give you a reward like this.

285
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Because I can beat you.

286
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Ployphart.

287
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Ployphart.

288
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Are you okay?

289
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Are you okay?

290
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Ployphart, are you going?

291
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
I'm going.

292
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Let's get out of here.

293
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Let's go.

294
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm sorry that we're late.

295
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Are you okay?

296
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Go and follow him.

297
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
Yes, sir.

298
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Let's go.

299
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
I'm sorry

300
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
that you have to get hurt because of us again.

301
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
I'm okay.

302
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
It's good that I'm okay.

303
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Because if anything happens to me,

304
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I'll be the one who's going to be punished.

305
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
It's not your fault.

306
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
But I won't let you go this time.

307
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Whoever dares to hurt me and my people

308
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
will be punished.

309
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Let go of me.

310
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Let go.

311
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Let go.

312
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Who sent you?

313
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,920
It's about the order from the lifeguard.

314
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Is it because I want to know if the gentleman is far away?

315
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
How can I trust someone like you?

316
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Are you okay?

317
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm lucky that I'm fine.

318
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,920
But my people got hurt.

319
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
That's good.

320
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Who dares to hurt you?

321
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
I think there are only two families

322
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
who are willing to cut off their children.

323
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
If you don't tweet Meta,

324
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
you'll be cursed.

325
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
My love can't catch one person

326
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
who claims to be your lifeguard.

327
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Taom is sick.

328
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
You should visit him.

329
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
See you later.

330
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Wait for me.

331
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Prepare the prayer for me in 10 minutes.

332
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Yes, sir.

333
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
I have something to consult you.

334
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay.

335
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Okay.

336
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
I think we should consult with the government

337
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,920
and the people who call for a clear and transparent prayer.

338
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Okay.

339
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I think it's better, sir.

340
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Are you going to continue playing or not?

341
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm done.

342
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,920
You're doing unnecessary things.

343
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
If I don't listen,

344
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
how can I know what they want?

345
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
You can still get a lot of harm from the government.

346
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
If you don't want to see this,

347
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
you have to go to the economic crisis.

348
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Do as I said.

349
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
Are you going to continue playing or not?

350
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
If you don't play,

351
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
why are you going to continue?

352
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
It's been a long time since the government visited us here.

353
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
We're fine now.

354
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
It's not difficult.

355
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920
But I'm sure Song is fine.

356
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
It's normal for a senior.

357
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
Don't worry.

358
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,920
What about your nephew? I heard that he was hurt.

359
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I got a little injury.

360
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I got to meet someone who is my senior.

361
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Thank you very much.

362
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,920
So you're relieved now.

363
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,920
It's a pity that the government can't catch the culprit.

364
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Don't worry.

365
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I'll have someone to investigate.

366
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Thank you.

367
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,920
But do you think you can be a good fit?

368
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
I'm not sure.

369
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Do you have any meaning in the question?

370
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I don't have any meaning.

371
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
I just want to know.

372
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
I'm sorry.

373
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Come in.

374
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
We haven't found the culprit yet.

375
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
I think we may need more time.

376
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I was so scared that I was about to die.

377
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I knew that it was the hands of those…

378
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Asawat and Teewatthin.

379
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Why can't we do anything?

380
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Do we have to wait like this?

381
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Do you think there's no evidence to play their game?

382
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Don't forget who is behind Asawat and Teewatthin.

383
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,920
And as long as I talk to Tao, he won't accept or deny anything.

384
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,920
He probably thinks he has the power to do anything.

385
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,920
Sir, is the meal ready?

386
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,920
I'll go to bed soon.

387
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Where are you going?

388
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Are you going to the temple?

389
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
What are you looking at?

390
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
It's about Muang.

391
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,920
From the words of the person who is in the situation,

392
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,920
this child wants to take money to treat her mother who is sick with cancer.

393
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Her mother was affected by the work in Muang.

394
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,920
What is the conclusion of this story?

395
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
I have to wait for the word to be announced again.

396
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
It's a small child.

397
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
No.

398
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Come here.

399
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
What? Why did you go out?

400
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
No.

401
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,920
Some of the members of the club have worked in the city of Asawat and Teewatthin.

403
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Now the club has expanded more.

404
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,920
It makes both the workers and the students from all over the country.

405
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,920
This story has spread like a fire.

406
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,920
From the opinion of the club, the image of the people cannot be controlled.

407
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,920
The more controlled, the faster the situation will be.

408
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Don't do this.

409
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Sir, sir.

410
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
Please excuse me for disturbing your personal time.

411
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
What's the hurry to come here?

412
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Why do you come to me?

413
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
I have something to ask you.

414
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,920
I want to study the politics at Asawat and Teewatthin.

415
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,920
I think it's better to end this competition.

416
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
But from the protests,

417
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,920
I think we need to adjust the politics of Asawat and Teewatthin.

418
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,920
The claims of the bad people are just rumors.

419
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
It's not just rumors.

420
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
I've seen the politics for a long time.

421
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
I've always seen good management.

422
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,920
If you study, you take care of the people as you should.

423
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
But I think that sometimes the rumors may be true.

424
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,920
You are Asawat and Teewatthin.

425
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Don't you believe that you can't be as good as your father?

426
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,920
I think you just want to verify the truth for sure.

427
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
I think there's nothing to verify.

428
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
If someone says that we are bad,

429
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
and we don't try to find any truth or proof,

430
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,920
it makes us feel like what people say is true.

431
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Get out.

432
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Can't you bear to hear the truth?

433
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

434
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Fine. I don't want to see your face anymore.

435
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Go.

436
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Go.

437
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Go.

438
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
Go.

439
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm alone now.

440
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,920
If you want to blame me, can you leave me alone?

441
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,920
You know that you shouldn't make your life miserable.

442
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
But you still do it.

443
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Can you give me a reason?

444
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
I can't just leave you alone like this.

445
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
I'm sorry.

446
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
The problem about the city and the weather

447
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
is not something that you can fix.

448
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Don't talk like you are my brother.

449
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I don't know what the truth is.

450
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,920
I want to know what the answer is.

451
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
Go.

452
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Go.

453
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Who are you?

454
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Tell me.

455
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Do you think you have the right to fight?

456
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Keep it.

457
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Your order to come to life is your order to come to life.

458
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm sorry.

459
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
Are you angry?

460
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,920
Are you angry?

461
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
I had a fight with the king.

462
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
The king just recovered.

463
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Don't fight with the king.

464
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm sorry.

465
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Your Majesty.

466
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,920
I came to tell you that you will return to the kingdom of the sun.

467
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
And soon there will be a big event.

468
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,920
What event?

469
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Aren't you going to tell me?

470
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,920
I'm sorry. I may not teach you well enough.

471
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:00,920
You don't remember?

472
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
It's a firework event of our city.

473
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,920
It has been a long time since this kind of fight.

474
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Are you interested in going to the event?

475
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Am I interested?

476
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,920
But can I go?

477
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
You have fixed your movement.

478
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
You have already practiced.

479
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Yes, but I have to get used to it.

480
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Good. You will remember it when you practice more.

481
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,920
Have you ever been to a firework event?

482
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
Yes, when I was a kid.

483
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,920
When I was a kid, my mother passed away.

484
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
I didn't go back to the kingdom of the sun.

485
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,920
Let's make new memories there.

486
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I promise you that I will practice hard when I'm there.

487
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,920
You are practicing hard.

488
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
No, I swear.

489
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:10,920
Do you think you can escape from the power of the great living god, Mr. Tattanai?

490
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Follow us.

491
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Where are we going?

492
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Where are we going?

493
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
Take a good walk through this way.

494
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Come on. Look at the camera. Do you want to be famous?

495
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Come on. I'll take you there.

496
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,220
Let's go.

497
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
This way.

498
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Okay, it's safe now.

499
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,920
Who are you? Why are you helping me?

500
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,920
I'm Wateed, Charan's friend.

501
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,920
What do you mean by Charan asking you to follow me?

502
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,920
Is there anything wrong?

503
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,920
No, just Charan sent me to take care of you.

504
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,920
It's okay. I can take care of myself. I have a lot of work to do.

505
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,920
I almost died. If I didn't help you, you might be captured by those guards.

506
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,920
They can't do anything to me.

507
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,920
Don't be too confident. If you are captured, it means you are captured.

508
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,920
So please cooperate with me. I think we can do it for Mr. Kanin.

509
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,920
What's wrong?

510
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Don't do anything to us. We have a problem.

511
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,920
We are in power.

512
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
If you can't do anything, get out.

513
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,920
I think we should do what we have to do.

514
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Changing is taking time.

515
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Changing requires courage and real intention.

516
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,920
Is the incident that caused the patients in the city true?

517
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Yes.

518
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
It's true.

519
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,920
We are in power.

520
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,920
Changing requires courage and real intention.

521
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Is the incident that caused the patients in the city true?

522
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
I'm tired.

523
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,920
It's late. Why are you here?

524
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
I want you to draw this picture for me.

525
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,920
I know that I only love you. Can you hear me?

526
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
I need your love.

527
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,920
Only you in my heart.

528
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Do you know that I only love you?

529
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,920
I need your love.

530
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Only you in my heart.
