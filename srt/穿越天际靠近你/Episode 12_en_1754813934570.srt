1
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,550
Dad,

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,580
please explain everything to me.

3
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,120
You are Prince Khanin,

4
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,570
the only heir of the Assavadevathin clan.

5
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,450
Your mother was ambushed.

6
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,910
She did not survive the incident.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,990
His Majesty sent me in secret
to rescue you.

8
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,400
He commanded me

9
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,160
to take you into refuge with me.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,490
Dad.

11
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,210
I still have no idea who hurt us.

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,440
If you want to find out
who hurt you and your dad,

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,440
the only way is to go to Emmaly.

14
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,090
I am...

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,690
Khanin Assavadevathin.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,090
A body, charred beyond recognition,

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,120
was found.

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,210
Once the results are in,

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,450
I will report to you
immediately, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,830
No need to do that.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
That body is Thatdanai's.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,160
What did you just say?

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,730
Thatdanai has passed away,
Your Royal Highness.

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,650
I hereby order your punishment

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,930
for neglecting your duty
to care for Khanin.

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,960
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,880
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,120
His Majesty has assigned this coach

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,280
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,690
Your Royal Highness...

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,600
Your Royal Highness!

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,600
Your Royal Highness!

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,479
Your Royal Highness,

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
can you hear me?

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
I want to entrust you with something.

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
I wish to know

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
who stands against me.

39
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,570
I haven't managed
to catch the culprit yet.

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,550
I'll have someone look into it.

41
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

42
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,329
But do you have any idea

43
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,040
who might be behind this?

44
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,400
It was taken at Heathrow Airport.

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,770
If I were to guess,

46
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,210
he's probably already in Emmaly.

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
Thanks a lot.

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,840
[Meet me in Assavadevathin]

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
Thank you, Wasin.

50
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,640
This is impeccable
and truly magnificent.

51
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,560
I am deeply grateful
to Your Majesty the King

52
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,080
for entrusting me with this duty.

53
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,120
And I thank Chana

54
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,760
for introducing the technology to assist
with scoring in this archery match.

55
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,440
In this round, I ask for your permission
to root for Khanin, Your Majesty.

56
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,080
Thank you.

57
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,680
Thank you.

58
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,159
How about rooting for Ava,
the front-runner?

59
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,240
She is unmatched
when it comes to archery.

60
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
It's too soon to say that.

61
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,120
Let's wait and see for ourselves.

62
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,080
Please, Father.

63
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,680
Welcome to the second round
of the Royal Competition.

64
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,000
This round features an archery match.

65
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,080
The competitors from all three clans
are now ready to compete.

66
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,680
This match features
four different targets:

67
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,680
standard targets,

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,700
birds,

69
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,480
horses,

70
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,400
and snakes,

71
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
each with their own scoring value.

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,280
Once the time is up,

73
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
the competitor with the highest score

74
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,560
will be crowned
the winner of this round.

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
All you have to do

76
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,520
is to get to the top.

77
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,320
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

78
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,440
You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

79
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,800
If you wish to change Emmaly,

80
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,720
one way to do it

81
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
is to win the Competition.

82
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,159
I'll do my best to win.

83
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
If all competitors are ready,

84
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,919
I shall now declare
the archery competition

85
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
officially underway.

86
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Ten,

87
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
nine,

88
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
eight,

89
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
seven,

90
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
six,

91
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
five,

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
four,

93
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
three,

94
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
two,

95
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,800
one,

96
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
begin.

97
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Sorry.

98
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
I just took the last shot.

99
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
What is happening?

100
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,840
What's going on?

101
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Smoke bombs.

102
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
What's going on?

103
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,560
Father...

104
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,000
Send someone out
to find Khanin immediately.

105
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Send the soldiers to the scene at once.

106
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,000
What's going on, Wasin?

107
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
Terrorism in Meenanagarin?
Is that possible?

108
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,000
There has never been
any act of terrorism in my city.

109
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I ask for time to verify the facts.

110
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,000
Please rest assured,
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses.

111
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,720
I won't allow my daughter
to be put in such danger.

112
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,080
I believe my people
are on their way to the scene.

113
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
My apologies, everyone.

114
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,040
We are currently unaware
of what has happened in the arena.

115
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,280
I kindly ask you
to proceed to a safe area.

116
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,680
Please.

117
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
- Ava!
- Ava!

118
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Are you okay?

119
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
Watch out!

120
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,320
These arrows are the same as ours.

121
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
It's a setup.

122
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,440
They want to make it seem like

123
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
we turned on each other.

124
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,920
Let's get out of here.

125
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Can you get up?

126
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Let me help.

127
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,320
Get on my back, can you?

128
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Yeah.

129
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
You alright?

130
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,050
Go, Khanin.

131
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,400
I'll see you at the designated spot.

132
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,640
Your Royal Highness...

133
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Father,

134
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm worried about Khanin's safety.

135
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,240
No matter what, he must be safe.

136
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
May I have your permission,
Your Majesty?

137
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,600
I apologize for my escape.

138
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
You have fled. What made you return?

139
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,760
Honestly, I had no intention to flee.

140
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,640
But being constantly watched
made it difficult to perform my duties.

141
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,320
Still, I have obeyed
your commands fully, Your Majesty,

142
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
to pursue the perpetrator.

143
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,640
Here is all the evidence
I have gathered.

144
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Your Royal Highness?

145
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,240
Make yourself at ease.

146
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
That would be inappropriate.

147
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,920
I wanted to meet you today
to talk about important matters.

148
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,480
I will ensure your protection

149
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,520
if you agree to help me.

150
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
Do you want me...

151
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,160
to help you?

152
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,520
Yes.

153
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,319
You must keep this confidential.

154
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,720
Do not reveal it to anyone,
not even His Majesty.

155
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,900
I don't understand.

156
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,119
Do you not trust His Majesty,
Your Royal Highness?

157
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not that I don't trust him,

158
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,760
but everything I do
is to keep Khanin safe.

159
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
I lost him once,

160
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

161
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,360
Are you implying that...

162
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,320
His Majesty holds no goodwill
toward Prince Khanin?

163
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,480
To my father,

164
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,240
Assavadevathin comes
before everything else.

165
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,280
Do it for Khanin.

166
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,680
Join me in this.

167
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,960
Prince Rachata is planning
to send a new coach to Prince Khanin.

168
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,720
Prince Rachata?

169
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,720
He must be plotting something.

170
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
There's no solid lead at the moment,

171
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,800
but it's possible he wants information
or is planning an ambush.

172
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,240
What's the name of that coach?

173
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
It's Joe.

174
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,160
Please send me his profile.

175
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,920
Okay.

176
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
I need your help.

177
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
With what?

178
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Coach Joe.

179
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,080
He was once a soldier
serving Bhuchongpisut.

180
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,000
Out of nowhere,

181
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
he became a top-tier fencer

182
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,880
in just a few months.

183
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,880
Got it.

184
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
At first,

185
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,120
all suspicion pointed
to the Bhuchongpisuts.

186
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
But once the truth came to light,

187
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,720
it turned out

188
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,480
they were merely a scapegoat.

189
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,560
Coach Joe's profile was fabricated.

190
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
So it was an intentional attack.

191
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
If you get caught,

192
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
you're as good as gone.

193
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,460
So please come with me.

194
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,640
If nothing else,

195
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,640
do it for Prince Khanin.

196
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
[Coach Joe Detained over Plot
to Poison Prince Khanin]

197
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,590
How did it turn out this way?

198
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,680
I'm confident nothing will reach you,
Your Royal Highness.

199
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,960
You've merely followed
Prince Wasin's advice.

200
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,640
Make sure everything is handled.

201
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,480
[You were right;
Coach Joe serves under Prince Wasin]

203
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,440
My source sent me these.

204
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
This forest is really perilous.

205
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,000
It's full of wild animals

206
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,320
and countless traps.

207
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,160
I'm noticing a lot of vulnerabilities
in this map.

208
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,520
Seems like it's designed
for a terrorist attack.

209
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,520
I never expected it...

210
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
to be Prince Wasin.

211
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
Because he seems kind?

212
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
You never know what's on someone's mind.

213
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,600
What do you think he's doing this for?

214
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Power.

215
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Everyone's just hungry for power.

216
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
In this freaking country,

217
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,520
everyone should be equal by now.

218
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,120
We're all human.

219
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,840
What's the point of having power?

220
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
To put himself above everyone else.

221
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,960
He also checked the storeroom today.

222
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,880
Jeez,

223
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,520
again and again?

224
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,220
Yeah.

225
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,440
If I didn't know things were calm,

226
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
I'd believe war was coming.

227
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,280
Come on.

228
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,920
Stop talking nonsense.

229
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,920
Shit...

230
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
The GPS...

231
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,520
[You were right;
my source spotted something off]

232
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,440
[Vedish: You were right;
my source spotted something off]

233
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Soldiers,

234
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
detain Prince Wasin.

235
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Follow me this way.

236
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
Your Majesty and Royal Highnesses,

237
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,240
please proceed this way.

238
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,810
All of you, please.

239
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,850
This way.

240
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,290
This way, please.

241
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,810
Soldiers,

242
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,080
detain Prince Wasin.

243
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,080
Watch out!

244
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,310
Your Royal Highness!

245
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
- Ran...
- Your Royal Highness.

246
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,440
Are you hurt, Your Royal Highness?

247
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,700
I'm okay.

248
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,440
Are you injured anywhere?

249
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
You're not hurt, right?

250
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,840
I'm totally alright,
Your Royal Highness.

251
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
This pearl...

252
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,400
has a tracker in it.

253
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
But Prince Wasin gave me this.

254
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,280
Exactly.

255
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,040
That's why I could locate you.

256
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
And if I could,

257
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,520
so can...

258
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
the rebels.

259
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,840
Are you implying...

260
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
Prince Wasin...

261
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
is behind the rebellion.

262
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,480
Because he has no heir,

263
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,080
he chose to get rid of everyone else's?

264
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,040
If you want to uncover the truth,

265
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,920
we need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

266
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm not certain

267
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,360
what other traps may be in this forest.

268
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,400
But Ava's injured.

269
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I'm okay.

270
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
Let's leave this place at once.

271
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
This way, please.

272
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
This way.

273
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
Are we all going to be safe, Ran?

274
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,960
Both clans have been directed
to proceed to the designated spot.

275
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,080
We shall meet again in Davin.

276
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,210
Are you hurt, dear?

277
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,350
I'm unharmed, Father.

278
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,480
Your Royal Highness, are you alright?

279
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I'm fine.

280
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,560
Have our people arrived?

281
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,280
The ship is almost here,
Your Royal Highness.

282
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,840
You think you can escape me?

283
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,240
What is it that you want?

284
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Nothing!

285
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,240
I never wanted anything
from someone as selfish as you.

286
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,040
You ripped my loved ones away

287
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,960
and tore my family apart.

288
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,120
Wait, wait.

289
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
Calm yourself.

290
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,760
Let's talk nicely and calmly,

291
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,320
and I shall grant you a pardon

292
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,040
and allow you to seek refuge abroad.

293
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm the one bringing you to justice.

294
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
How many lives have you taken?

295
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,680
You probably don't even know

296
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,040
that it was your grandfather
who killed my family.

297
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,520
So...

298
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,080
what matter brings you here today?

299
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,280
My wife was born in Assavadevathin.

300
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,960
She is currently deeply concerned
about the severely polluted air

301
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,600
near the mine, Your Majesty.

302
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,440
Has your wife just returned
from Assavadevathin?

303
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
No, Your Majesty.

304
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,720
But she was informed by her family.

305
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
What makes you certain that it's real?

306
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,280
There is no reason to lie,
is there, Your Majesty?

307
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,080
Wow, how very optimistic of you.

308
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,840
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty,

309
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,160
my family has told no lies.

310
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,440
I beg you
to help the people, Your Majesty.

311
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,360
How can I do that?

312
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,680
I humbly request that

313
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,800
you order the concessionaire company

314
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,240
to build containment pits for mine waste

315
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,120
to lessen the pollution

316
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,960
and protect the well-being
of the local people.

317
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Let's say
I have acknowledged your request.

318
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,640
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

319
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,200
With your permission,
I shall take my leave.

320
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,880
May you be blessed
with good health, Your Majesty.

321
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Thank you.

322
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440
We've come to ask
for your help, Rachata.

323
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,800
We were hoping you could support

324
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,800
the proposed mining law.

325
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,320
The proposed mining law?

326
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,600
Our inspection
of the gold mine in Assavadevathin

327
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,040
revealed a complete lack
of pollution control.

328
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,960
So we're asking all clans

329
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,040
to propose a regulatory law
for mining operations.

330
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,440
Certainly, I will lend my support.

331
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,240
We appreciate that.

332
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,160
I would like to ask for your help

333
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,000
to invent technology
that can reduce dust and pollution

334
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,480
as the people in Assavadevathin,

335
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,520
especially ones near the mine,
are suffering terribly from the issues.

336
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Interesting.

337
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,840
Here's a quick thought.

338
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,960
Air purifiers should be able
to address that.

339
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,160
It's quite an intriguing idea.

340
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,400
My love...

341
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,840
My love,

342
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,880
I'm right here.

343
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,560
Shall I inform the miners
right away, Your Majesty?

344
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
No need.

345
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,840
Understood, Your Majesty.

346
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
My love...

347
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
My love.

348
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,160
My love!

349
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,320
My princess...

350
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,760
After the lung and allergy medicine
was introduced,

351
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,210
patient visits at Bhuchongpisut Hospital

352
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,800
have risen over 200 percent,
Your Royal Highness.

353
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,040
This could be very profitable.

354
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
So...

355
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,600
I'll have the development team
accelerate this project immediately.

356
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
I will cause every one of you

357
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:43,390
pain and torment far beyond
what happened to my love.

358
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,440
Announce to all

359
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,800
that Her Royal Highness has passed away
due to preeclampsia.

360
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

361
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,760
When I declared why my wife died,

362
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
no one...

363
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,400
None of you even cared
if it was that disease.

364
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,560
My wife died from lung cancer

365
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,560
because of your careless
mining operations.

366
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,680
And now, you've got lung cancer, too.

367
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
Yet, you've never even tried
to do anything.

368
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,040
All you care about is the capitalists,

369
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
whether they'll gain profit

370
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,800
or whether they'll support you.

371
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,720
You only care if your family's power

372
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,200
will be threatened.

373
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,920
You care nothing for the people,

374
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,840
nothing for the country.

375
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,120
Go to hell.

376
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,480
Your Majesty...

377
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
Why are you protecting him?

378
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,040
Don't you know he's the one
who caused your mother's death?

379
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Stop! Drop the gun.

380
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
- Wait...
- Wirun?

381
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,680
I said, "Drop the gun."

382
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Guns down.

383
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,480
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

384
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,520
- Your Majesty!
- Grandfather...

385
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,440
Your Royal Highness...

386
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,600
- Your Majesty...
- Father!

387
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,240
- Grandfather...
- Why, Wirun?

388
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,120
How does it feel to be betrayed
by the one you trusted most?

389
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,560
Try to understand me.

390
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,920
My sister lost her life,

391
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,840
and my whole family died
because of your mine.

392
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,600
Is your wife Wirun's sister?

393
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,880
You just never cared about anyone.

394
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,800
After all, blood is thicker than water,
isn't it?

395
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Is this the reason

396
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,640
you took my side?

397
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Intentional or not,

398
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
the outcome wouldn't change.

399
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,200
Stop pretending to be the victim.

400
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Thanks to Wirun for the information.

401
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,840
It gave me the opportunity
to seek revenge again.

402
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,000
You should try Earl Grey,

403
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,080
the tea imported from the UK.

404
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,960
As soon as I found out from Wirun

405
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that Khanin was still alive,

406
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,760
- I sent my men to get rid of him.
- Go.

407
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
We need to change the plan.

408
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,320
I'll reach out to you once we're there.

409
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,600
Since the assassination attempt
in the UK failed,

410
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,600
I realized I had to separate
Charan from Khanin.

411
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,040
Otherwise, the plan would never succeed.

412
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,840
You are dismissed
from your role as his coach

413
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
and confined,
prohibited from seeing him.

414
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,160
So you want me
to lose the Competition, Grandfather?

415
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,960
Your Royal Highness...

416
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,350
And I did it.

417
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
His Majesty has assigned this coach

418
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,160
to be your personal trainer,
Your Royal Highness.

419
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,050
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

420
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,200
But Joe messed it up,

421
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,440
so I turned to Rachata instead.

422
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,800
Who do you work for?

423
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,080
Kill him.

424
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,480
His Majesty the King!

425
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,000
Turned out he was a coward.

426
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,680
Why can't we do anything?

427
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,480
You think you can take them down

428
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,800
without any proof?

429
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,200
Didn't have the guts to do anything.

430
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,200
I had no choice
but to finish it myself today.

431
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,040
But since I couldn't hurt you directly,

432
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,480
I had to hurt the one
you placed your hopes in.

433
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Prince Wasin,

434
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,880
Wirun...

435
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,080
I understand you all,

436
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
but killing us won't do any good.

437
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,680
Stop, Khanin. There's no need.

438
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
I am the King.

439
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,200
They can't lay a hand on me.

440
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,720
Are you sure?

441
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,640
- Your Majesty, Prince Tharin...
- Let's go!

442
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Thatdanai?

443
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,190
Freeze! Don't move.

444
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
This way, please.

445
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,440
Dad...

446
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,280
Khanin!

447
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,200
- Khanin!
- Dad...

448
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,400
Nin...

449
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,520
Khanin.

450
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,080
How have you been?

451
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,000
- I missed you.
- I'm okay.

452
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,420
You should go now.

453
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,360
We'll talk later.

454
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,360
Charan, take him.

455
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
- This way.
- Let's go.

456
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,360
- Your Royal Highness!
- Watch out!

457
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,560
Chakri...

458
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,680
- Chakri!
- Chakri!

459
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,440
- Chakri!
- Chakri...

460
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,070
Chakri, hey!

461
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,960
Chakri...

462
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,960
Chakri!

463
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,600
Ran, what do we do?

464
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,080
- Chakri!
- Chakri...

465
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,840
- Chakri...
- Chakri...

466
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,260
Chakri,

467
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,500
I'm here to see you.

468
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,800
About what Prince Wasin said,

469
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,680
can you tell me about that?

470
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,120
For the Competition's archery match,
taking place in Meenanagarin...

471
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,340
Even if something happened to the King,

472
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,920
wouldn't the Competition
still has to go on?

473
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,640
Soon,

474
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,960
we shall rise
and rule over this country.

475
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,640
I believe we have an opportunity
to bring about change.

476
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,200
You must win the fencing match.

477
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,880
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

478
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,480
His Majesty...

479
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,080
