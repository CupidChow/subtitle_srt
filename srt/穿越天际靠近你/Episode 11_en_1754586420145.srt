1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
to the next level.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you want to be the Emily's friend,

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the determination to win

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
is another way to help this country.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm glad that you're willing to practice

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the skill better than before.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let your son continue practicing with Mira

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
or give up this competition.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want you to draw me.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you like me?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you like me as much as I like you?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Nan.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can I go to the next level

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
just to be your friend?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Of course.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You have to know the basics.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can only think and draw with your eyes.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to answer like a thesis.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like what I'm a teacher

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or a normal art teacher.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't have to be a member of the royal family.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't have to be a part of the rules

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
or be forced to do anything.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't have to take responsibility for anyone.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's true.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If you're not a member of the royal family,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
then you're just a normal citizen

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
who spends his life for me.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You don't need power.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But if you have power,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
use it as best you can.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's better to use it to your benefit.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your truth

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you have more power than me,

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I want to use it to do the same to others.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Whatever you do,

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
whatever position you're in,

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll be with you.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We are free

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We are free

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We are free

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In less than a week,

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you will have to compete with me.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The first round is the second round.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There may be questions

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that show more thought than answers.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I prepared a set of questions for you to answer.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The wind that blows today

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
not only makes the leaves fly,

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
but also brings the words of blessing to the land.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:17,940
For the

83
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,940
competition of the royal family,

84
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
I will give you a good lesson.

85
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,940
This is a very long time

86
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
that I have been waiting for until today.

87
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
You have worked hard

88
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
for the gods all the time.

89
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,940
I'm happy to hear it.

90
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
Good, good.

91
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
Good.

92
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Say it as well as you can.

93
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,940
And I would like to receive your congratulations.

94
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,940
The first round of competition that the people can vote for

95
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,940
shouldn't be a problem for you.

96
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,940
You have always been the favorite of the people.

97
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
You will definitely win.

98
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,440
Yes.

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Increasing competition this time

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
is for the benefit of the people.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
But for the next round of competition,

102
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
why do you agree to follow the winner?

103
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Why do you say that?

104
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,940
Why?

105
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
As close as possible,

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
is it possible

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
to have too many people

108
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,440
join the gods?

109
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Sometimes we have to use power to convince the people.

110
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
But the blessing to the people

111
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
is the same as keeping the people's minds.

112
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
To give Eva a competitive woman

113
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
and also increase the competition

114
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
that Eva is talented and capable of

115
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
is to make Rammin happy.

116
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,440
But will it make the king lose his favor?

117
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,440
You are really smart.

118
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,940
It's true.

119
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
But you have never been a powerful man.

120
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Giving hope to the people

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
is a very powerful thing.

122
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Eva is still good at shooting arrows.

123
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,440
But she can't defeat the family.

124
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
That's right.

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm just a lowly man.

126
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
I can't compare to you.

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Today is a good day.

128
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Let's go to the ceremony.

129
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,940
Yes, sir.

130
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Are you stressed?

131
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,940
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I changed my new look for you.

133
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,440
My hair is cute, neat, and good looking.

134
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Let's drink tea.

135
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,940
Tea.

136
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't be nervous.

137
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Just follow what I taught you.

138
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm not scared.

139
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I've been to all the places around.

140
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Everything is fine.

141
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm really strong.

142
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm scared.

143
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
You did a bad job.

144
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I can do it.

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I read and practiced.

146
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,940
Don't worry.

147
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
What ifâ€¦

148
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
No matter what the result is,

149
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I will always be with you.

150
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Don't be stressed.

151
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Drink tea and calm down.

152
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
The tea is more exciting than me.

153
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:14,940
I'm out of it.

154
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll get you some water.

155
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,940
Thank you.

156
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
It's no different from the old one.

157
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't be stressed.

158
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Just do your best.

159
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,940
Okay?

160
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Min, we haven't seen each other for a long time.

161
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I want you not to doubt my love.

162
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,440
I've loved you for 22 years.

163
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
But in the past,

164
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I didn't want to show anything

165
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
because I didn't want you to be touched.

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
But now I see you.

167
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,440
You are so strong and beautiful.

168
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
I'm so proud of you.

169
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Thank you.

170
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
I understand you.

171
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm so happy that you understand me.

172
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
It's almost time for the competition.

173
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
You have to prepare yourself.

174
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Do your best.

175
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,940
Okay.

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Take a deep breath.

177
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,940
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Today is an important day

179
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
that the people of Emily have been waiting for for 3 months.

180
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Since the announcement of the event.

181
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Finally, we have come to the first round of the national competition.

182
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I said the first round

183
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
because the rules of this competition are different from the previous ones.

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
In the first round, we will answer the questions

185
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
to test the technique and the speed of the clip.

186
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
By answering one question per person.

187
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Soon, we will meet the three men and women.

188
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
The three men have been selected.

189
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
In the meantime, I would like to announce

190
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
the three men from the city council to compete in this competition.

191
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,440
It's so good to have a day like this.

192
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,940
It's true.

193
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
They stopped us to see

194
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
who will be the next person to rule our country.

195
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
It's the same as before.

196
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Finally, people like us

197
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
have to solve our own problems.

198
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,940
I think so.

199
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Do you really think so?

200
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,940
Yes.

201
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
P'Toon, do you want some water?

202
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:00,940
Why don't you call me?

203
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
And today, our country has been honored

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
from the country of the neighbors like Bucha.

205
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Hey, look.

206
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
That'sâ€¦

207
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,440
I want to thank you for coming to this competition.

208
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,940
Shit.

209
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
They didn't leave me, did they?

210
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
You don't know who I am, do you?

211
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,940
Of course, I do.

212
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
You don't know that I'm the prince?

213
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:32,940
Jay.

214
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,940
Jay.

215
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:34,940
Jay.

216
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Can you take the prince to be your servant?

217
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
That's so cool.

218
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:38,940
Hey.

219
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,940
Damn.

220
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
I think

221
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
you should know it too.

222
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
The King of Life

223
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
The King of Life has seen the importance of the voice of the people.

224
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
So he has decided to have the competition

225
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,440
decided by the people of M.R.E. through voting.

226
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
There's a vote too.

227
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
It's never happened before.

228
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Just a vote.

229
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
But when it comes to the decision,

230
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
no matter how much it is, you never know.

231
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
The King of Life

232
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
It's time.

233
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
I announce the start of the competition.

234
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Emily Nampani.

235
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
The King of Life

236
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,440
The first person to answer the question of the competition is

237
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Mr.Ramin, the finalist.

238
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Please come to the position.

239
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
The question of Mr.Ramin is

240
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,440
What problems do we have in our country

241
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
that are overlooked and become a problem

242
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
and are not yet being fixed properly?

243
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Please send the presentation to the people of M.R.E.

244
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
This is not the question I prepared.

245
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
No, Your Majesty.

246
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,940
Come on.

247
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:33,940
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm sorry.

250
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm sorry.

251
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,940
I will quickly check the situation.

252
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
There's nothing to fix.

253
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Just keep checking

254
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
to see if there's anything wrong.

255
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Actually, we think that all problems in M.R.E.

257
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,940
are important and should be fixed.

258
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
But if we want to choose one problem that is overlooked,

259
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,940
I think it's a family problem.

260
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,940
From last year's statistics,

261
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,940
the number may not be much, just 4,000 to 5,000.

262
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,940
But we must not look at this problem as just a number.

263
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
But it's a problem of people.

264
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
The family's violence

265
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
is often caused by women and children

266
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,940
and is affected by the body and mind of the perpetrator.

267
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
What are you doing?

268
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,940
But it's a wrong belief.

269
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
It's a generation-by-generation conflict

270
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,940
that has been passed on

271
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
that it will stimulate,

272
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
teach,

273
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
and promote the culture.

274
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,940
But it actually has a scar on the minds of many people.

275
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
It makes people lack confidence,

276
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
have various obstacles in life,

277
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,940
and even enter into society.

278
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
This makes people lack the potential

279
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,940
to grow up to be good adults

280
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
to develop the country.

281
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
We believe that

282
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
children are the future of the nation.

283
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
Everyone is the future of the world.

284
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
And that's the reason

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
why we have to solve this problem.

286
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,940
A gift for the son of the King of Ramin.

287
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
And the next rank,

288
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,940
please welcome Ms. Aewa, Tawit Betha, to the position.

289
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,940
If the law can be changed in the country of Mali,

290
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,940
how do you want to change the law?

291
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,940
The Mali law is passed on by people with male gender.

292
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,940
So some things are not fair to women

293
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
or other genders.

294
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,940
Even if there is a law that is equal to gender,

295
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
it still lacks understanding of other parts.

296
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Don't ask too much.

297
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
The teacher is a woman.

298
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,940
Isn't she too much and looks down on us?

299
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
I think that people with equal pay

300
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,940
should increase the quota for women in the position of governor.

301
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
I think it's a kind of information.

302
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,940
You have to understand that women have no equal rights as men.

303
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Addition of women's participation in the national and international organizations.

304
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,940
Adjust the education system to reduce gender inequality.

305
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Why is there only father and daughter here?

306
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
There are no women.

307
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
There are many people. I believe that men have to find a family.

308
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,940
The wife has a duty to take care of the house.

309
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
If you can do it, I believe that

310
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,940
there will be equal laws and women's rights will be protected for a long time.

311
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Please give the presentation to the professor of the Faculty of Science.

312
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,940
And the next question is from Mr. Kanin Asawatthewatin.

313
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Please, sir.

314
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,940
If you could recommend the way to stimulate the economy of emily,

315
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
what would be the way, sir?

316
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
There are many good things in emily.

317
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
There are interesting cultures

318
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
that are not only good for the country,

319
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
but also good for the country.

320
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
There are many good things in emily.

321
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
There are many good things in emily.

322
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
There are interesting cultures.

323
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
There are very delicious food.

324
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,940
Like me, I like Da Vin's spaghetti sauce that I ate since I was a kid.

325
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:18,940
The food, culture and culture of emily

326
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
can be used as a soft power.

327
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,140
Lin.

328
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,940
You called Mr. Kanin well.

329
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,140
Thank you.

330
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,140
But I think he must miss you a lot.

331
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Besides, emily also has four cities

332
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
with different characteristics.

333
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,140
We like that the most ancient city is Pichonpichut.

334
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
It has interesting history.

335
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
It has a beautiful scenery.

336
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I like the bright color of the sun at Meta's Tawit.

337
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
It's full of fun.

338
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I like the atmosphere that is the same.

339
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
The people are the same, even though we are gentlemen.

340
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,140
And the sea of Meenanakarin is beautiful to the point of suffocating.

341
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,140
And most importantly, we love this work called The Light at Asawatthewatin.

342
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:47,140
Which is the life and belief of the people who lead the country.

343
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,140
The fact that we get to know the people in each region

344
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
is the reason that makes us know that

345
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,140
the best thing about emily is the people who are cute,

346
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,140
who are themselves, and ready to welcome foreigners.

347
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
If we organize a campaign to push the indigenous people

348
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
to return to the people in each region

349
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,140
so that they can take care of themselves more,

350
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,140
it will further stimulate the tourism economy of the country.

351
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,140
But before we plan to stimulate other economies,

352
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
we think there are still problems that need to be fixed.

353
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
What are the problems?

354
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
The dust problem of Asawatthewatin

355
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,140
has long been affecting Emily's reputation.

356
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Fixing this problem

357
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,140
will help raise the economic and living standards of our country.

358
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Thank you.

359
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Please give a speech for the ceremony of the King of Kaninpaya.

360
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Please give a speech for the ceremony of the King of Kaninpaya.

361
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:33,060
And now, the three princes and the princesses have sent their

362
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
statements to the three questions.

363
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,140
Next, we will move on to the time of the first decision.

364
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Which every emily can vote for the prince and the princess from now on.

365
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,140
I'm glad.

366
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,140
Sis, sis, sis.

367
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,140
What's wrong?

368
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,140
Uh, uh, I'm glad.

369
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,140
I'm sorry.

370
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,140
You should be more sympathetic towards women.

371
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
I vote for you.

372
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,140
You're right. You're so fast.

373
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
Especially when you're a university student.

374
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
But I prefer the prince Lamin

375
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,140
who understands the problems of the family and the children.

376
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,140
But the prince Kanin seems to see the problems of Emily

377
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,140
more broadly than anyone else.

378
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Then I vote for the prince Kanin.

379
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:14,140
3 2 1, please close the vote.

380
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,140
And now, the results of the emily vote

381
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,140
throughout the country are all in our system.

382
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,140
I would like to present the vote and announce the person who got the highest vote.

383
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:53,140
And the person who got the highest vote is you.

384
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:15,140
The man who got the highest vote is Lamin from Phuchongpisut.

385
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Congratulations to the man who got the highest vote, Your Majesty.

386
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:46,140
But the royal competition is not over yet.

387
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,140
There are still two more rounds of competition waiting.

388
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,140
The next round will be a competition around the emperors in Meenanakarin.

389
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Which will be held in three days.

390
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Lamin is really the favorite of the emily people.

391
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

392
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
I would like to express my congratulations.

393
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Don't be sad.

394
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
I understand that your personality is always good.

395
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,140
But the people may see it with your talent.

396
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,140
What Lamin said is like a lot of things to me.

397
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,140
Don't look at me so mean.

398
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
I'm not that mean.

399
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
What do you call it?

400
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,140
Comfort. I'm just comforting you.

401
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
The competition is not over yet.

402
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,140
It's not the time for you to comfort anyone.

403
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,140
In fact, if our talent

404
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
can really solve the country's problems,

405
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
it will be a useful result for the people.

406
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
There is nothing to be comforted.

407
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,140
It's true, as you said.

408
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Why are you in a hurry?

409
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
How could it be?

410
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,140
We have been competing for a long time.

411
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
That's right.

412
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
See you next time.

413
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
I'm sorry.

414
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Can I talk to Mr. Kaning?

415
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,140
I admire that you are brave enough to answer the question.

416
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
Like that?

417
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,140
You talked about the problem of Asawat and Watin.

418
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,140
The louder and stronger the voice, the more we have to talk.

419
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,140
You are very good at calling for the law of equality.

420
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
I dare to say it because I have a problem with myself.

421
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,140
I feel relieved after saying it.

422
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,140
Even though I lose this time, I'm not sure about the next time.

423
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
I don't think I will lose either.

424
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,140
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
Can I answer you?

426
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
I'm sorry.

427
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Father, I can do it.

428
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
I'm glad.

429
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Do you think it's the best move of the audience?

430
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,140
It's good because I did it.

431
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
I'm sorry.

432
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,140
Who do you have the wisdom to defeat?

433
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Who are you?

434
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
God.

435
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
It's the order of the Lord of the Rings.

436
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,140
I'm sorry.

437
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
You are as good as the teacher.

438
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
You only think about the direct thing.

439
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:18,140
The survival of the audience must win

440
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,140
to come back as big as possible.

441
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
It's risky.

442
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
I don't care.

443
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,140
Go and buy the risk for it to be smooth.

444
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,140
How? Ram's vote must be the first.

445
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
I have given you the answer.

446
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
Father, then.

447
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,140
Then.

448
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Your duty is to go to the highest point.

449
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
Don't miss it.

450
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,140
Do you understand?

451
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Yes, sir.

452
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
I'm sorry.

453
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Thank you for coming out as a friend.

454
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
You're welcome.

455
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
But my friends are a bit loud.

456
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm annoying, right?

457
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
When?

458
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
I told you.

459
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
It's fun to have a lot of people.

460
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Normally, there are not many people in our house.

461
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
Stop it.

462
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
I'm okay.

463
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
You're so silly.

464
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
I invited you out for a walk

465
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
because I want you to come out to the air.

466
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Maybe you'll feel better.

467
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
I'm sorry.

468
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Karwin?

469
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,140
No, the prince of Karwin, right?

470
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
No.

471
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,140
Why?

472
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Don't you want to talk to him anymore?

473
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,140
I don't know.

474
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,140
I don't know how I feel now.

475
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
Go talk to him anyway.

476
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
It can't be.

477
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,140
It can't be.

478
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,140
It's okay.

479
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
But if we don't talk,

480
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,140
nothing will get better.

481
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
If you don't want to talk to him anymore,

482
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
just tell him frankly.

483
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
That's all.

484
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
My face?

485
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
I told him

486
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
that I don't care about me.

487
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Why do you have a hair like this?

488
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,140
We have nothing for sure.

489
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,140
We don't know when we will meet again.

490
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
When we will meet for the last time.

491
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Go talk to him anyway.

492
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Let's talk about this news.

493
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
This story happened online.

494
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,140
They happened to see a clip.

495
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,140
In this clip,

496
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
it's a storm storm about the weather.

497
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,140
But in that storm,

498
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,140
there's a prince of Karwin,

499
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
a prince from Phuja,

500
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
who is also in that clip.

501
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,140
Sis.

502
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,140
Sis.

503
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm going upstairs.

504
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
P'June is not here?

505
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
She's in her room.

506
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
Can I sit with you?

507
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
I have something to explain.

508
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Is there anything to explain?

509
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,140
It's just that

510
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,140
youâ€¦

511
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
Go.

512
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
I can't be with you anymore.

513
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
Can you talk to me like before?

514
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
I can't do that.

515
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,140
I have to do what's right.

516
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,140
I have to do what's right.

517
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
You mean

518
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,140
you will leave me like this?

519
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,140
We shouldn't have met like this from the beginning.

520
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Who?

521
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Don't do this.

522
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,140
I'm sorry.

523
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
I shouldn't have

524
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,140
known the truth from you.

525
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Before this,

526
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
I really wanted to tell you.

527
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,140
If you're done with the storm,

528
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
can I meet you?

529
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
On the day you were in the storm?

530
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,140
Yes.

531
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
But that day was chaotic, soâ€¦

532
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
I'm sorry.

533
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
I'm here today to apologize

534
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,140
and say goodbye.

535
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
I was ordered to go back to Bujaa.

536
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,140
I'm sorry.

537
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,140
I'm really sorry.

538
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,140
I don't have to accept that apology.

539
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,140
I'm sorry.

540
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,140
We shouldn't have met again.

541
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,140
Please go back to Bujaa.

542
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,140
I said please go back to Bujaa.

543
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
I'm sorry.

544
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,140
I'm sorry.

545
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:32,140
Wawa, I know the truth now.

546
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,140
So I have to find the picture.

547
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,140
About what?

548
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,140
My man

549
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,140
said that the king of the kingdom cheated the vote last time.

550
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,140
So he won the competition.

551
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,140
Welcome to the second round of the King's Competition.

552
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,140
This time, the three teams have prepared

553
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,120
the

554
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,140
three teams have prepared

555
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,140
I give you the ladder.

556
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,140
Your duty is to go to the highest point.

557
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,140
This competition is not clean anymore.

558
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:42,140
You have to do everything to win this competition.

559
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,140
If you want to share Emily's intention to compete,

560
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,140
it's another way to help this country.

561
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:15,140
If you're ready, I'd like to announce the start of the shooting round.

562
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:25,140
On this count of three, two, one, start.

563
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,140
I don't trust the king of the kingdom.

564
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,140
Just join hands.

565
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,140
We've lost him before. We don't want to lose him again.

566
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,140
Send me the code of the king.

567
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,140
Everyone in our country needs a leader.

568
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Let's take it to the heart.

569
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:51,140
From now on, I will only listen to the heart.

570
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,140
The whole world is like me.

571
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,140
I will leave it.

572
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
Will it be?

573
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,140
From now on,

574
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,140
every minute is not just us.

575
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,140
I will hold it.

576
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
Every night,

577
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,140
let love go.

578
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,140
Just listen to the heart.
