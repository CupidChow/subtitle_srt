3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,080
But the care that goes
beyond that closeness

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,840
doesn't reflect well, Charan.

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,920
I'm merely taking care
of His Royal Highness

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,080
I have no other feelings or intentions.

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
But we're friends, too, aren't we?

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,880
I returned and agreed to compete

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,240
just to find out
what happened to my dad.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,160
I had Vedish look into the evidence
I got from one of the attackers in the UK.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,720
Have you told Grandfather about this?

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
You're the first to know this.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
- And I'll tell...
- Don't tell him just yet.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,560
We should look into this ourselves first.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
We are delighted

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,200
that you came to visit our city.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
There's still one more important place

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
I'd like to show you.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,730
Argh.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,600
Ouch!

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,640
Prince Khanin.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,080
Prince Khanin.

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
Are you wounded?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm sorry to make you worry.

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
You mean more to me

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,039
than you could ever imagine.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,880
Prince Calvin of Bhujar

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,580
is to come and further his studies
in the arts at your university.

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,080
I fear that

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,640
I will have no time to dedicate
to training Prince Khanin.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,800
Go on and do what you truly love.

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Some distance
between Khanin and Charan

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,759
might be for the better.

34
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,680
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Is something the matter?

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,520
Mr. Wirun requests
that Prince Khanin should hurry

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
as all the royals are already gathered
in the grand hall.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,560
This way, please.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Khanin!

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,440
How are you doing?

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
Have you settled in yet?

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,039
Kind of, actually.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
That's great.

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,920
Hope to see you around more often.

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,560
You're so nice.

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Thank you.

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,600
You must be unfamiliar
with Emmaly's customs.

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
Hence, your manner
is so at odds with ours.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,079
Your Royal Highnesses,

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
it shall soon be time.

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Please proceed inside.

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,750
Don't worry about it.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
We are gathered here today

54
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,720
to propose fair terms
for this year's Royal Competition.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
All are welcome to voice their thoughts.

56
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,360
I worry for Ava, Your Majesty.

57
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
She's a woman,

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,720
and in competitions
between men and women,

59
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,160
it is not uncommon
for the men to hold back.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,120
Isn't gender irrelevant in this matter?

61
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,640
When the match begins,

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
no competitors show mercy.

63
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,940
Are you suggesting that
women stand equal to men?

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,140
Does my presence mean nothing?

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,230
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,470
For this Royal Competition,

68
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,390
all clans with heirs
should be allowed to participate.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
The Competition shall proceed
as it always has

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,750
in accordance with
the traditions of Emmaly.

71
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,960
May I be permitted to speak,
Your Majesty?

72
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,470
You may.

73
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
I humbly propose an addition
to the Competition.

74
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,440
While fencing remains
our proud tradition,

75
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
it may no longer be sufficient.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
I propose we include a test of ingenuity.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,480
The diverse talents of our heirs

78
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
will strengthen our kingdom's standing
on the global stage.

79
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,760
Would it be a good idea to include
a quiz competition, Your Majesty?

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,480
It would enhance the Competition.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,020
Furthermore,

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,860
we could allow the people
to participate by voting.

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,120
I agree with Prince Wasin.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Beyond fencing and ingenuity,

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,070
in addition to those competitions,

86
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,170
would it be wise
to include archery as well?

87
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,130
I agree with Prince Chana, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,440
Very well, let us follow these rules

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and host three competitions
for this year's Royal Competition.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
I must respectfully disagree,
Your Majesty.

91
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,020
Fencing has been
our long-standing tradition,

92
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,800
and altering the rules
would be highly inappropriate.

93
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Should Prince Rachata disagree,
I understand fully.

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,300
After all, I have no heirs
to carry on my lineage.

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,740
My proposal was made
only out of goodwill toward Emmaly.

96
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,920
The tests of ingenuity

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
and archery skills

98
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,980
are indeed appropriate.

99
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,680
Let all preparations be made.

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,080
Khanin,

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,880
Ramil,

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,760
and Ava,

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
the heirs of the three clans,

104
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,050
are to gather in Davin City
for their training.

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,560
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,890
Let the Royal Palace make it known:

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
the Fifth Royal Competition

108
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
shall take place in the near future.

109
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,920
[Khanin: Hey]
[Khanin: Where are you today?]

110
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,620
[Khanin: Why don't you answer me?!]
[Khanin: Charan]

111
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
[Khanin: Heyyyy!!!!!]
[Khanin: When are you coming?]

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Look!

113
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,080
What's wrong with you?

114
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,400
That was Professor Charan?

115
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,120
Yeah, Professor Charan Phithakthewa,

116
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,840
the nationally renowned art instructor.

117
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,520
His family owns our university,

118
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,160
and he's also adopted
by His Majesty the King.

119
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
Have you seen this?

120
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,560
It's a fan page
shipping him and Prince Khanin.

121
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,520
They're so cute together.

122
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,600
Aw, that's adorable.

123
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,040
Hey,

124
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,600
I think I'll go to the square this evening

125
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,770
to join the environmental campaign march.

126
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,980
You coming?

127
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Who's coming with you?

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,480
The usual guys.

129
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,490
Sure, I'm coming.

130
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,640
Let's go.

131
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,440
Wait...

132
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,480
- Hey, Jay.
- Yeah?

133
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,880
Your nose is bleeding.

134
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,250
Sit down right here.

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,140
Shit.

136
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Got any tissue paper?

137
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,280
No.

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I'll go find you some.

139
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
- Be right back.
- Okay.

140
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
Jeez...

141
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,600
Why are you back so early?

142
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,400
Oh...

143
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
I thought you were my friend.

145
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
It's okay.

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,120
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

147
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,440
Oh,

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200
that's alright. It's just a nosebleed.

149
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,320
If you're feeling better now,
please excuse me.

150
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Oh, okay.

151
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Wait, hey!

152
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,160
Your handkerchief...

153
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,720
What?

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,480
If there's anything else you'd like,
please let me know, Your Royal Highness.

155
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Thank you.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,840
Please just call me Calvin.

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Come in.

158
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Hi, Professor.

159
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,250
I've been informed

160
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,200
that this semester,
I'll be a student assistant again

161
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,860
just like I was last semester.

162
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,240
That's right.

163
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,160
Let's work well together.

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Sure.

165
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,760
This is Calvin,

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
an exchange student from Bhujar.

167
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,680
Just transferred into our program.

168
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,080
Hi, I'm Jay.

169
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,240
Calvin's still getting used to the place.

170
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Please keep an eye on him for me.

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Sure.

172
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,160
Over here is our faculty building,

173
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,520
and this entire area

174
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,400
also belongs to our faculty.

175
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,440
By the way, what made you decide
to study here?

176
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,440
In my country, this place is renowned
for its excellence in the arts.

177
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Which area of art
are you most skilled in?

178
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,200
Painting?

179
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,400
I haven't figured that out.

180
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,200
I know how to do everything, though.

181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,880
How about you?

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,600
Sculpture, I believe.

183
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,920
- I see.
- Right,

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
the handkerchief
I borrowed you this morning...

185
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll have it cleaned up
before returning it to you.

186
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
That's fine.

187
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,960
It's yours now.

188
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
You can't do that.
It seems pricey, though.

189
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,310
I'll clean it up and sanitize it,

190
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
then I'll give it back to you.

191
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,520
The national flag of Emmaly

192
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,960
features a crest
that unites the emblems of all four clans.

193
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
The emblem of the Assavadevathin clan
is a golden horse

194
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
since their region is known
for extensive gold mining operations.

195
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,680
As a result, gold has become
a key economic product of their domain.

196
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,440
You don't seem very focused today,
Young Prince.

197
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
I'm too tired, Chakri.

198
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Well then...

199
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,800
You should have some rest.

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Let's take a break from the lesson

201
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,140
and check this out.

202
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,120
Here's the list of top fencing coaches

203
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,360
that Prince Tharin has arranged
for Your Royal Highness.

204
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Why do I need to see it?

205
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Prince Tharin truly cares about you,

206
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,640
so he's sent skilled coaches
for you to choose from.

207
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah.

208
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
You can choose one for me, then.

209
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,000
I can't, Your Royal Highness.

210
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
Please choose one.

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,400
I don't feel like doing anything.

212
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Please at least have a look at it.

213
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,120
Please.

214
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,040
You want me to choose a coach, right?

215
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,080
That's right, Your Royal Highness.

216
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,430
But I remember that...

217
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,640
you're still keeping something from me.

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,960
If you tell me where Charan is,
then I'll agree to choose.

219
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
Well, I...

220
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
have no idea, Your Royal Highness.

221
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,520
No coaches for me, then.

222
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
No, you can't do that.

223
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Please choose one.

224
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,480
If you don't tell me where he is,

225
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,500
I won't choose.

226
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,580
I'll go find him myself.

227
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,880
That's even worse, Your Royal Highness!

228
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,880
If you leave the palace by yourself,

229
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,620
I'll end up locked away forever,
Your Royal Highness.

230
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Then, you'll take me to him.

231
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,560
Your Royal Highness!

232
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,920
You wanna play tag, Your Royal Highness?

233
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,780
Please don't...

234
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,840
Your Royal Highness...

235
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,560
Your Royal Highness!

236
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,440
Your Royal Highness...

237
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
Okay, I give up.

238
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
You win, Your Royal Highness.

239
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,920
Okay.

240
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
You win, Your Royal Highness.

241
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,360
This one.

242
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
We're done with the coach now?

243
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Let's go find Charan.

244
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,560
Your Royal Highness!

245
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Let's go change.

246
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Come on, Your Royal Highness...

247
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,770
Take it easy

248
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,080
and let your brush move
with your feelings.

249
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,280
What you went through
must be tiring, right?

250
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
Have something sweet.

251
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
It might help ease your stress.

252
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,280
Thank you.

253
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
The Garden of Eden...

254
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,600
Haven't you finished it yet?

255
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,040
I haven't had time to do so,

256
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,760
but I should have more time for art
from now on.

257
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,520
That gorgeous Garden of Eden

258
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,280
really shows how greedy people can be.

259
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
We all desire to have everything.

260
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,280
The more forbidden something is,

261
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,560
the more we want to own it.

262
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,270
Such feelings are difficult to restrain.

263
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,520
You are the most important
and precious to me, Your Royal Highness.

264
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,240
How did the last class go?

265
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,960
I did an abstract painting.

266
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,880
I saw your painting from last class.

267
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,680
Is something bothering you?

268
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
That's a tough question.

269
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,040
If something's troubling you,

270
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,880
you can let it out through your artwork.

271
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,000
Well...

272
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,520
About what happened,

273
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
I can't say much about it.

274
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,000
But as an Emmalian,

275
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,300
I just want you to know that

276
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,120
I was worried about Prince Khanin, too.

277
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Please do not let that trouble you.

278
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,320
His Royal Highness is safe now.

279
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,160
Hearing it directly from his royal guard

280
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,450
has put my mind at ease.

281
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
You may continue your painting.

282
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,760
Okay.

283
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Ahem.

284
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,600
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

285
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,440
I was just passing by here.

286
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you okay, Your Royal Highness?

287
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,460
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry.

288
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,600
Right,

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,400
His Royal Highness
was looking for a toilet.

290
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,600
This way, please.

291
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
That's weird.

292
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
How come His Royal Highness is here?

293
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,480
I'll see you next week.

294
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Why are you here, Your Royal Highness?

295
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I came to...

296
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
look around

297
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
and learn.

298
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,380
Why aren't you at the palace with me?

299
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,680
Why do you have to be here?

300
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,760
You didn't answer any of my texts.

301
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,740
I'm a professor,

302
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,260
and I have been ordered by His Majesty

303
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,580
to look after the prince
from the neighboring country.

304
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,820
Where is he, then?

305
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
You were with Paytai, weren't you?

306
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,720
Mr. Paytai is a student
in my special class.

307
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,440
That's why you don't have time.

308
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,880
- I was merely doing my duty.
- What about your duty to protect me,

309
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
take care of me,

310
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,960
and protect and remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins?

311
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,120
I, Khanin Assavadevathin,

312
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,310
command you, Charan Phithakthewa,

313
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,480
to reside in the palace every day
as my royal guard.

314
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Professor, it's time...

315
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
Uh...

316
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,520
Well...

317
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,040
My apologies for the discourtesy.

318
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,800
Who said you could come in?

319
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,960
So, I'll take my leave
and let you two continue.

320
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,360
I need to attend my class for now.

321
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,080
I'll come back

322
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,440
and finish our conversation later.

323
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,290
If it's not too much trouble,

324
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,400
I kindly ask that you...

325
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,100
keep Prince Calvin's title confidential

326
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
as requested by His Majesty.

327
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,120
Everyone has things they're not good at.

328
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,720
No one's good at everything
from the start.

329
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,060
But anything

330
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,680
can be learned, Your Royal Highness.

331
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,600
Not this one, though.

332
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,000
I think it might be best
if you head back to the palace first.

333
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,000
You need to come with me.

334
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm afraid that won't be possible now
or anytime soon, Your Royal Highness.

335
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
Are you going to disobey my order?

336
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
That's not what I meant,

337
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,720
but I must be here to teach my students.

338
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,320
Chakri,

339
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,080
why did you take it with you?

340
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,120
Oh...

341
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,820
I noticed that

342
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,480
you were trying so hard to paint this,

343
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,720
so I have brought it back for you.

344
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,280
Uh...

345
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
The car's parked over that way.

346
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's go.

347
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm not leaving.

348
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,240
You were rushing out,

349
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,520
so I thought...

350
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,240
How can I leave now?

351
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,680
What's taking him so long?

352
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,000
Chakri,

353
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,840
go get Charan.

354
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,840
Your Royal Highness,

355
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,360
you ordered Mr. Charan to come out,

356
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,000
yet he still hasn't.

357
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,970
I am honestly at a loss
as to what else I can do.

358
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Excuse me.

359
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Have you seen this person?

360
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,080
I haven't.

361
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,840
- Oh, thank you.
- No worries.

362
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,620
- Is it ten plus one?
- Yes.

363
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,920
Excuse me.

364
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

365
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,400
You want some popcorn? Here you go.

366
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,900
Oh, I'm good.

367
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,420
I was gonna ask...

368
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,040
if you've seen this person.

369
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,360
Wait...

370
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
He seems familiar.

371
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,800
I think I've seen him somewhere.

372
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
Really? Where did you see him?

373
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,320
I may not have.

374
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,200
Come on, have you seen him or not?

375
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,900
I mean, it's been a long time.

376
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,740
Well...

377
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm kinda stuck,

378
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,000
but if you've got anything
to get my brain going,

379
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,360
it'll be easier to figure it out.

380
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,840
How much do you want?

381
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,460
Come on, we're like friends.

382
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Let me ask how much you have.

383
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,420
It takes a lot of brainpower, you know.

384
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,880
- You need to...
- Jeez.

385
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,640
Hey,

386
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,640
I can give you a discount.

387
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,360
How much can you pay?
I'm fine with anything.

388
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,080
You can pay me after I find him.

389
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Come on, give me the job,

390
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,800
- or you won't find him.
- Can we have some popcorn?

391
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,360
- We want some popcorn.
- Sure, kiddos.

392
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
- Popcorn, please.
- Sure.

393
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
[Charan: Got anything?]
[Vedish: Still no clue yet]

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,560
- The last guy went missing for 48 years,
- We'd like some popcorn, please.

395
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,080
- but I found him in a day.
- Some popcorn, please.

396
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
Sure, sweeties.

397
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Let me know if you need more colors.

398
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
You should take a break.

399
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Thanks for today.

400
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,090
If you'll excuse me...

401
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,520
Adding more color right here

402
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,150
can give it greater depth.

403
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,100
Right here?

404
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
Is it better?

405
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,400
Paytai.

406
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Your Royal Highness...

407
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,160
Is this the matter you talked about?

408
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,440
Come with me now.

409
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,200
Don't you know who you belong to

410
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,760
and what your duties are?

411
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,360
I know who I belong to

412
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and what my duties are.

413
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
But there is no rule
that says I cannot study art,

414
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
is there?

415
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Charan works for the Assavadevathins,

416
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,200
my enemies.

417
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
If you don't want trouble,

418
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
stay away from them.

419
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

420
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,760
Now that you know,
make sure it sticks in your head.

421
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
I am fully aware of who I belong to.

422
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
I have acted inappropriately.

423
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Please punish me, Your Royal Highness.

424
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
You are mine,

425
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,040
all mine.

426
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,760
Siwakorn,

427
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
secure all the coaches.

428
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
Don't let anyone else have them.

429
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

430
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
You know

431
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,840
why I called you here, don't you?

432
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You've been wasting time on nonsense.

433
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
How do you expect
to compete with others?

434
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
Please forgive me, Father.

435
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,600
I've gotten you some new coaches.

436
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,920
From here on,

437
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,840
the Competition matters the most to you.

438
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Keep that in mind.

439
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,840
Yes, Father.

440
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,080
I will do my best to train.

441
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Good.

442
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Because if you won't,

443
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
I will have to dismiss your companion.

444
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
I understand, Father.

445
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,040
Oh...

446
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,680
Did no one tell you

447
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,840
that there's been a change
in today's schedule?

448
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,000
This is my coach.

449
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,800
Say hi.

450
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,000
If you'll excuse me, I'll continue
my training with the national coach.

451
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,240
As for you,

452
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,360
have fun with the dummy.

453
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
Good luck,

454
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,000
Mr. Number One
of the British Fencing Club.

455
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
It's okay.

456
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
I'll find you a new coach.

457
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,400
No need.

458
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,840
I know someone.

459
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,080
You're finally back, huh?

460
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Is there anything I can help you with,
Your Royal Highness?

461
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
So this is what you want?

462
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
If there is nothing else you require,

463
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,560
I may take my leave.

464
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,280
I've brought the completed painting
of the Garden of Eden

465
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,159
to offer to you, Your Majesty.

466
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,739
Thanks for thinking of
an old guy like me.

467
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,420
Your painting skills
remain as exquisite as ever.

468
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,159
Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,080
The garden at the Phithakthewa Manor

470
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,000
was in fact inspired
by the Garden of Eden.

471
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,320
This painting

472
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,679
is actually from
my mother's favorite spot.

473
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,960
That is all the matter I have for today.

474
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,920
May Your Majesty be blessed
with good health and strength.

475
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Don't leave just yet.

476
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
Grandfather,

477
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,920
I have a request to make.

478
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,560
Right now, I am training alone

479
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,600
without a coach to guide me.

480
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,380
I feel lost, Grandfather.

481
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm uncertain if I'm on the right path.

482
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,800
Alright.

483
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,360
I understand that
I did not grow up in Emmaly

484
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,840
and may still be seen as an outsider.

485
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,840
But I am deeply determined
to do my best in this competition.

486
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,720
I want you to understand that

487
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,960
you had to be raised in another country

488
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,740
solely for your safety.

489
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,560
As for your coach,

490
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
do not worry.

491
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll make sure
to find a skilled one for you.

492
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,280
I understand the reasons
behind what you did.

493
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,040
However, as for the coach to train me,

494
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,520
it's something I'm concerned about.

495
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,680
I think...

496
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,320
the coach should be someone
who understands me well

497
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
and can provide me with proper guidance.

498
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,570
I think...

499
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,440
there is one person
suitable for this role.

500
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,860
Having the right and capable coach

501
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,680
will help me recognize my weaknesses

502
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
and overcome my rivals.

503
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,920
I wish for Charan

504
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,080
to be my coach, Grandfather.

505
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
You shouldn't have said that
to His Majesty.

506
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,120
I was simply stating facts.

507
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Bargaining is totally normal.

508
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,880
I am not a bargaining chip.

509
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
I didn't say you were.

510
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
I know what I need to do,

511
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
and it's what Grandfather wants from me.

512
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,120
All I ask

513
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,360
is to have you by my side.

514
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,320
Since you brought me to the palace,

515
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,840
you have kept your distance from me.

516
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,680
Why can't you be my coach?

517
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,520
Is it because
you don't wanna be around me?

518
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,560
You flew across the sky
to bring me back,

519
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,880
and now you're just going to
leave me like this?

520
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
You have no sympathy
for me at all, do you?

521
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,320
It's not like that, Your Royal Highness,

522
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,580
but His Majesty...

523
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,760
What if he says
we can't see each other ever again?

524
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Will this be the last time we meet?

525
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,720
Answer me.

526
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,560
Your Royal Highness,

527
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,480
please conduct yourself appropriately.

528
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,950
So this is inappropriate, huh?

529
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Look into my eyes.

530
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
I told you to look into my eyes.

531
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Now answer me.

532
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,840
Why can't you be my coach?

533
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,520
I don't fence in front of others.

534
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Anyway,

535
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,680
I shall be your coach from now on.

536
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,560
If I overstep in any way,

537
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,880
I ask for your forgiveness in advance.

538
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,760
I think...

539
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
the coach should be someone
who understands me well

540
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,480
I wish for Charan

541
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,640
to be my coach, Grandfather.

542
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,240
It seems like
you're really in a good mood today.

543
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Please inform the university

544
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
that I won't be able to teach
for some time.

545
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,760
When will you be returning
to teach again, Master?

546
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,350
Not until the Royal Competition is over.

547
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,720
Any updates?

548
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,400
Just like I texted you.

549
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,140
About Mr. Thatdanai,

550
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,800
I just sent you a picture. Check it out.

551
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,020
It was taken at Heathrow Airport

552
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,480
on the same day we met in Thailand.

553
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,640
If I were to guess,

554
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,840
he's probably already in Emmaly.

555
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,480
But I'll look into it more
and get back to you.

556
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,260
I'll let you know
when there's an update.

557
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:39,920
That's all for now.

558
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,800
Thanks a lot.

559
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,600
Well done, Chakri.

560
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,520
Did you order these from Thailand?

561
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,480
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

562
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
How refreshing.

563
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,720
Your Royal Highness,

564
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,960
please remove your fencing uniform.

565
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:16,840
What?

566
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Why?

567
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,520
Please take it off.

568
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,720
You want me to be your coach, don't you?

569
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,920
Yeah.

570
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,440
One. All the way up and down.

571
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,920
Two.

572
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
All the way up and down.

573
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,980
Keep going.

574
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,820
Do it fast.

575
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,920
Faster.

576
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:37,800
One,

577
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,480
two...

578
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,560
Harder.

579
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,520
Three.

580
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,280
Faster?

581
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Harder.

582
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Good, Your Royal Highness.

583
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,920
Faster.

584
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on.

585
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,000
Hey,

586
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,230
won't you give me a break?

587
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,360
You've just finished three sets.

588
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,160
Do you wish to stop already?

589
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,480
No,

590
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,730
I'm just...

591
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,650
exhausted.

592
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,840
Faster, Your Royal Highness.

593
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,720
Faster than that.

594
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,280
- Ouch.
- Oh...

595
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,200
Your Royal Highness,

596
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,480
are you hurt?

597
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,280
My ankle might be sprained.

598
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
This ankle?

599
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,640
No.

600
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
This one.

601
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Chakri,

602
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,160
His Royal Highness is severely injured.

603
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,680
Please get the doctors immediately.

604
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,320
Oh...

605
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,360
I think we should...

606
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,280
Uh...

607
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
I'll get the doctors.

608
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,160
Uh...

609
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,840
I think I'm feeling better now.

610
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,920
If you are,

611
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,840
then let's continue our training.

612
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,320
Argh.

613
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
It hurts now.

614
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,880
This training

615
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,400
is to strengthen your body.

616
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,840
It is a crucial skill

617
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
to enhance your endurance

618
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,880
and help you last longer in a match.

619
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,520
I'm too tired.

620
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,000
Can't we fence already?

621
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,280
Are you sure you want that?

622
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm more than sure.

623
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,760
Were you born with a sword or something?

624
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,840
Shall we continue, Your Royal Highness?

625
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,720
You won't give me a break, will you?

626
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
I thought you wanted to fence.

627
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,760
Well, yeah.

628
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,880
Your Royal Highness,

629
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,600
please forgive me.

630
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,550
Mr. Charan, I'll...

631
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,320
It's okay.

632
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,480
Bring a cooling towel
and some cold analgesic gel

633
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,040
to His Royal Highness' room.

634
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,120
Okay.

635
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:54,600
Come here.

636
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,680
Don't drop me.

637
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,480
His Royal Highness simply misstepped,

638
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,120
causing him to fall and twist his ankle.

639
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,120
Let's have Khanin
take a break for now, then.

640
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Khanin.

641
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,480
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

642
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,520
Meenanagarin

643
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,680
is the southern city of Emmaly,

644
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,150
and its main export commodity is
the dark champagne pearls.

645
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,440
This is beautiful.

646
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,880
I'd love to see the dark champagne pearls
with my own eyes.

647
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,280
They're hard to come by

648
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
and must be ordered in advance.

649
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,560
Well...

650
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,000
If you wish to see it,

651
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,440
I know a place I can take you to.

652
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,520
These pearls belonged to my mother.

653
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,240
My father had it custom-made

654
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,760
and gave it to my mother
on their wedding day.

655
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,200
If I may...
