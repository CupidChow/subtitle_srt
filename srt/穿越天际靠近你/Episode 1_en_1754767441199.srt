1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,760
Centuries ago,

2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
the lands of Southeast Asia
brimmed with life and riches.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Meenanakarin,

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,920
Davichmetha,

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Assavadevathin

6
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,200
and Phuchongphisut

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,600
coexisted in peace for generations

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,240
until an enemy came unbidden,

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
and all four kingdoms were attacked.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,880
The king of Meenanakarin called for unity,
so the four kingdoms became one:

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,400
the nation of Emmaly.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,580
Years passed,

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,000
the dynasties took turns on the throne,

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,039
and now it belongs to King Thipokbowon
of the Assavadevathins.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,160
For when we stand united,

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
we shall never fall.

17
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
Mr. Charan.

18
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,980
His Majesty has issued
a royal command for you

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,750
to appear before him
within the next half hour.

20
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,500
Understood.

21
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,970
Stop it, Charan.

22
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,740
Your skill remains as sharp as ever.

23
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,780
This is the finest combat instructor
who trains our royal guards.

24
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,270
His role remains classified.

25
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,950
You must be quite curious
why I tested you, aren't you?

26
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm certain you have
your own justifications, Your Majesty.

27
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,770
The cicadas are shedding their skin.

28
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,390
Summer must be coming soon.

29
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,720
Wouldn't it be great
if someone who understands me

30
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,630
could join me for a cup of tea?

31
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,550
One more thing,
I've mentioned this many times.

32
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,550
When it's just the two of us,
there's no need for formality.

33
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,970
You're still the grandson I've raised
since you were little.

34
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,250
Now rise.

35
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,950
My apologies, Your Majesty.

36
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,970
Have a seat.

37
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,600
Sit down.

38
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,520
You're the only grandson

39
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
I can talk to freely.

40
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,760
How are you doing?

41
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,070
I have withered away
as the days went by,

42
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,870
but I feel lonely.

43
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,400
That's why I asked you to join me.

44
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,140
What kind of tea would you like to drink?

45
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,400
Chamomile or oolong?

46
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,200
Both can no longer satisfy me

47
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
because I know there's something better.

48
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,560
You should try Earl Grey,

49
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,480
the tea imported from the UK.

50
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,450
The flavor lingers...

51
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,470
reminiscent of days long gone.

52
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,420
But now, I am too old to fetch it myself,

53
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,570
and I cannot trust anyone enough
to ask for such a favor.

54
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,360
If you trust me,

55
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
I will bring it to you.

56
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,240
Then you should hurry.

57
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,920
You're the only one
I can place my trust in.

58
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,560
Go to Thatdanai, an old friend of mine.

59
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,640
He will have
the finest tea prepared for you.

60
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,030
If you wait any longer,
it may be too late.

61
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
Your command is my will, Your Majesty.

62
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,950
En garde.
(On guard)

63
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,400

You got this.

73

Allez.
(Go)

74
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,860

One-minute break.

En garde.
(On guard)

83
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,440
Prêts?
(Ready?)

84
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,440

- Yes.
- Good.

113
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,890
Nice shot.

114
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,060
Let's go!

115
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,250
The last one was great.

116
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,870
Yes.

117
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,320
- Good.
- Yes, come on. Yay.

118
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,540
Congratulations to
the winner of Group A, Kenneth.

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,720
I've heard that
Kenneth is of Emmaly descent,

120
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,240
one of the best fencing countries
in the world.

121
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,400
He's also the best
in his university's fencing club.

122
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,910
It's not surprising.

123
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,150
Please give
Kenneth support in the Finals.

124
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,430
Kenneth, Kenneth, Kenneth.

125
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,630
Shit.

126
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,290
I'm just messing around, mate.

127
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,750
By the way, congratulations.

128
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,670
Hey,

129
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,110
why are you following me?

130
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,150
Are you a scout?

131
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,440
What?

132
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,100
You can't speak?

133
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,650
What the hell do you want?

134
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,290
Why is it?

135
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,940
Don't know what I'm saying, huh?

136
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,680
I guess you're not a scout, then.

137
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
I see.

138
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,790
Are you trying to flirt with me?

139
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,950
Gosh, man.

140
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,480
Has no one told you that
following someone you like

141
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,780
is kind of creepy?

142
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,520
And I have no interest in you.

143
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
What a waste of time.

144
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,520
My apologies.

145
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,150
Don't jump to conclusions.

146
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,280
Wait...

147
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,480
- You speak...
- And has no one here told you

148
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,040
that every time you lunge,
your shoulder twitches first?

149
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,900
That little habit of yours

150
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,710
might be the reason you lose one day.

151
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
Is this really
all the top fencers of the club

152
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,440
have got?

153
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,290
You still have lots more to work on.

154
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,880
Who the hell are you?

155
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,050
- If you think you know me so well...
- It's not just your shoulder.

156
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,500
You're also too hasty.

157
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,680
I say this with the best intentions.

158
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,600
If you stay this way,

159
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
victory will never be yours.

160
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,770
Alright.

161
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Here you are.

162
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,250
Have a seat.

163
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
You know what? Today...

164
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,730
I've made it to the Finals.

165
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,670
Really?

166
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
Congratulations.

167
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,480
Don't get ahead of yourself just yet.

168
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,440
- For the Emmalians...
- For the Emmalians,

169
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,640
I am not yet strong enough
to be a professional fencer.

170
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,970
Emmaly this, Emmaly that.

171
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,870
This food is Emmalian.

172
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,110
The house looks like
it came straight out of Emmaly.

173
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Why didn't you just name me Emmaly, too?

174
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,120
It's good that you know that.

175
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,110
Eat up.

176
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,890
After this,
you'll come to practice with me.

177
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,480
Gosh, Dad.

178
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,760
You won't give me a break, will you?

179
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,340
Khanin...

180
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeah, fine.

181
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,960
Nin,

182
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,040
mind your table manners.

183
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,140
I know.

184
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,240
Wasn't gonna use it.

185
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,740
I just took it out.

186
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,480
If you hadn't become a writer,

187
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,170
you would've been a soldier.

188
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,620
Every time you lunge,

189
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,850
your shoulder twitches first.

190
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,800
Is this really
all the top fencers of the club

191
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,780
have got?

192
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,310
What's going on?

193
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
You seem distracted today.

194
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,240
Is something wrong?

195
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,170
I...

196
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,660
Nothing, Dad.

197
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,680
Let's give it another try.

198
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,500
Relax, okay?

199
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,190
Stay focused. Breathe.

200
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,110
Start when you're ready.

201
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,580
Take a deep breath.

202
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,100
Right.

203
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
That was very good.

204
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,680
I'm proud of you
for recognizing your own weakness

205
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,050
and fixing it on your own.

206
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,120
Am I really better?

207
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:52,940
Yes.

208
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,870
Your problem is that

209
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,540
you move your shoulder a bit too early
and tense up,

210
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,000
but I can tell
you're trying to change that.

211
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
Let's try that again.

212
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,520
Relax.

213
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,930
Take a deep breath. Focus.

214
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,060
Good.

215
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:18,810
Right.

216
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,890
Great.

217
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,120
Halte.
(Halt)

218
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,920
Yes.

219
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:35,720
Halte.
(Halt)

220
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,840
Yes.

221
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,650
- Yes.
- Yes.

222
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,680
Allez.
(Go)

223
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,610
Halte.
(Halt)

224
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,520
En garde.
(On guard)

225
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,810
Prêts?
(Ready?)

226
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,050
Allez.
(Go)

227
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,560
Nice one. Let's go.

228
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,250
Yes, yes, yes.

229
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,560
Kenneth, you're the first Emmalian
that I've ever faced.

230
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,810
Congratulations.

231
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,080
Thank you for the match.

232
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,640
May I ask you? Who taught you fencing?

233
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,590
It's my dad.

234
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,120
Surprise!

235
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,660
You?

236
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,570
Why are you here?

237
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,840
- I have...
- Leave that to me.

238
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,130
Nin,

239
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
this is Mr. Charan.

240
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,840
He's gonna stay with us for a while.

241
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,180
Mr. Charan?

242
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,530
He's the grandson of someone I respect.

243
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,710
I don't get it.

244
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,080
You told him to leave that to you.
What did you mean by that?

245
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,080
Why does he have to stay here with us?

246
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,440
Make sure to be a good host, Khanin.

247
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,490
Ugh, running out again…

248
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,800
Where do you think you're going?

249
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,210
Why are you down here?

250
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,720
Can't I?

251
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,430
Fine,

252
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,340
just do whatever you want.

253
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,800
I'm just not used to

254
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,920
having a stranger in my house.

255
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,780
Why do you have to be here?

256
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,810
You can ask your dad.

257
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm asking you.

258
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,380
Don't you have a place to stay?

259
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,010
I do,

260
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,390
but there's a reason I have to be here.

261
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,280
Wait,

262
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,280
a reason to be here?

263
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,910
What is it?

264
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,480
Your dad knows everything
you wish to know.

265
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,060
Try asking him.

266
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,020
Dad.

267
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,800
Yes?

268
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,440
Look,

269
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
I won.

270
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,480
Great job.

271
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,680
Thanks, Dad.

272
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,590
I was gonna show it to you yesterday,

273
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,010
but something happened.

274
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,000
Give me a moment.

275
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,920
Here.

276
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,240
Do you need to cook for him, too?

277
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,260
Nin...

278
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,550
I'll go practice, then.

279
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,030
Not in the mood to see someone.

280
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,490
Nin...

281
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,360
I'll go eat with Paul at the club.

282
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,310
See you.

283
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,670
- Kenneth.
- Shit.

284
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,440
- I got you.
- Oh, my God, Paul.

285
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,890
What's going on, mate?

286
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,410
You've been so jumpy lately.
Are you okay?

287
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,280
Honestly,

288
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,480
lately, I feel like I've been followed.

289
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,580
All the time.

290
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,000
Come on, you're being paranoid.

291
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,290
I mean,

292
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,990
there's no one here.
Just literally you and me.

293
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,200
Wait,

294
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,870
don't you tell me that

295
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,140
this is the reason
you didn't answer the phone last night?

296
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,400
Kenneth,

297
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,640
we were waiting for you,

298
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,600
to party with you.

299
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,240
I was exhausted.

300
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I nodded off.

301
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,570
It's okay.

302
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,160
Today, we have a party
at Samantha's place.

303
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,650
You have to come, please.

304
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,790
I've got you two choices: yes or yes.

305
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,200
Please.

306
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,680
Yeah.

307
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,280
- So we have to go.
- At least I won't get to see Charan.

308
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,200
Come on.

309
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,160
Uh...

310
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,840
Who are you,

311
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,000
sir?

312
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,270
I'm Kenneth's friend.

313
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Friend?

314
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,280
Nice to meet you.

315
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,950
Hi.

316
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,660
I just heard that
your friend invited you to a party.

317
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,600
- It's none of your business.
- I'm coming with you.

318
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,370
Don't be ridiculous.

319
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,680
Who are you to come?

320
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,640
I heard you're having a party,
celebrating Kenneth's win, right?

321
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Oh, yeah.

322
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Can I come?

323
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,840
Well...

324
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah, my man.

325
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,450
You know what? The more, the merrier.

326
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,310
I think.

327
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,600
So, what's your name, sir?

328
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,800
Charan.

329
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,280
Charang? Charang.

330
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,240
Right, let's join us.

331
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

332
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Why not?

333
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,480
Come on, boy.

334
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,110
That's a great idea. You like it,

335
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,000
don't you?

336
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,240
No?

337
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:53,100
Jump, jump!

338
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,040
Hi, guys.

339
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,640
My cousin brought
Tao Kae Noi seaweed snacks

340
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,450
from Thailand for you all.

341
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,930
So enjoy.

342
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,530
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

343
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,630
Are you having fun?

344
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,590
- It's okay.
- Good.

345
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,320
Cheers...

346
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,620
- to the winner.
- The winner.

347
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,040
- Hi.
- Hey.

348
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,880
This is for you.

349
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,260
Thanks.

350
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,250
Are you guys enjoying?

351
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,300
How is it going?

352
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,750
- It's going great.
- Good?

353
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,080
You know, I'm a bit tipsy now.

354
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,950
Hi.

355
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,100
Oh, hey.

356
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,700
So, you said

357
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,440
you were a friend of Kenneth,
am I right?

358
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,520
You can say that.

359
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,820
Okay.

360
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,480
You never told me
you had a hot friend, Kenneth.

361
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,680
He's your type.

362
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,130
Quit staring at me.

363
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,050
You want this?

364
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,640
It's good, though.

365
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,960
Try it.

366
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,130
Guys, cheers.

367
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,110
Cheers.

368
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,160
- Cheers.
- Come on, cheers.

369
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,540
- Cheers.
- Yeah, drink.

370
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,250
Man, you're such a heavyweight.
You're drinking a lot.

371
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,120
No. No, I'm not.

372
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,960
I just know when to stop.

373
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,920
Okay.

374
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,530
He's good, though.

375
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
So you're friendly now, huh?

376
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,020
I've never been unfriendly.

377
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
Come on, guys.
What are you guys talking about?

378
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,040
Hey, hey, hey.

379
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,040
- Hey, boy.
- Hey.

380
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,200
Should we go inside?

381
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,920
Exactly, that's a great idea.

382
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,150
Let's get inside.

383
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,920
- That's a perfect idea, you know.
- Yeah.

384
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,010
Give it back if you won't eat it.

385
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,920
Let's play a game.

386
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,880
A game?

387
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,360
Yeah, what game should we play?

388
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,880
You wanna play anything? Any idea?

389
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,350
I think we should play...

390
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,750
The Pocky Game.

391
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,250
The Pocky Game? That's a great idea.

392
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,080
Come on, man.

393
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,910
Play with us, Kenneth, my boy.

394
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,200
No, I'm not playing that.

395
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,130
- Come on.
- Come on, man.

396
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,240
We're here to celebrate your win.

397
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,700
So, you must play.
There's no choice for you.

398
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,780
And Charang...

399
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,060
Join us, too. Come on.

400
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,740
No.

401
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,480
Come on, man. Don't be mean to him.

402
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,900
He's our new friend.

403
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,950
Yeah, yeah. Let's spin it for a pair.

404
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,020
Yeah, you go first.

405
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,300
- Come on.
- Thank you.

406
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,030
Alright, let's go.

407
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,310
No... No, come on, man.

408
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,540
Why?

409
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,040
Don't look at me like that.

410
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,940
I did not wanna pair up with you.

411
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,600
Do you think I wanna do this? Come on.

412
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,280
Why it has to be you?

413
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,440
Your turn. You gotta do this.

414
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,480
- Come on.
- Come on, Kenneth.

415
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,550
Oh...

416
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,350
That's a good one.

417
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,040
Wow, that's crazy.

418
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,870
Alright. Okay, I'll be your referee.

419
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,120
So, the rule is very simple.

420
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,360
You make your pocky
as short as possible,

421
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,940
and the pair
with the shortest piece wins.

422
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,240
And the losers must drink.

423
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,360
Right?

424
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,640
I have no plans to lose.

425
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,800
If you're afraid, just leave.

426
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,920
Why do I have to?

427
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,480
When we share the exact same goal.

428
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,640
I'm ready.

429
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
I wish you were.

430
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,430
- Alright, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

431
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,160
Ready?

432
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,280
- It's not hard.
- Okay.

433
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,910
Three,

434
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,139
two,

435
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,750
one.

436
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,120
Go!

437
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,320
Go, go, go. Yes.

438
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Yes, closer.

439
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,000
Paul,

440
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,800
- Yes, yes. Closer.
- go, go.

441
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,400
- You got it.
- Closer.

442
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,520
- Go, go.
- Closer. Closer, yeah.

443
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,239
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, closer.

444
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,040
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

445
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,719
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yep.

446
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,840
Who's gonna win?

447
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,960
Come on, man.

448
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,100
Closer, closer.

449
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,570
Who's gonna win?

450
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,710
You're gonna win?

451
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,710
This is good.

452
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,889
This is good.

453
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,159
Gosh, let me see.

454
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,590
Show me.

455
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,080
- This is good.
- Show me the results.

456
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,230
Check it.

457
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,100
- Ours is way shorter, right?
- Yeah.

458
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,960
Show me the piece.

459
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,700
You see? It's obvious.

460
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,380
- No, no.
- The winners are...

461
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,340
Kenneth and Charan.

462
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
Did you guys...

463
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,000
- Oh, no.
- No, dude!

464
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,960
Did you guys kiss?

465
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,880
Come on, man. This is not...

466
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,960
Hey,

467
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,220
what's wrong?

468
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,820
Are you still thinking
about the game earlier?

469
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,120
Seriously?

470
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,530
Just 'cause our lips touched?

471
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,460
Do you know...

472
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,500
about the tale of the Emmalian kiss?

473
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,360
No.

474
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,880
A kiss is a kiss. Nothing special.

475
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,080
What? Are you gonna tell me or not?

476
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,570
Okay.

477
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm not curious anymore.

478
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,820
I'll get my stuff and leave.

479
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,510
Nin.

480
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,660
You're still up?

481
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,710
Why are you back so late?

482
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,400
I went to a party
with Paul and the others.

483
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,280
I thought I'd already texted you.

484
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,600
I was just worried.
It's good that you're back now.

485
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,120
Get some rest.

486
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,250
Dad,

487
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,400
I wanna know about...

488
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,760
the tale of the Emmalian kiss.

489
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,280
Why do you wanna know about it now?

490
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,970
Well, I'm just curious.

491
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,730
You always tell me
everything about Emmaly.

492
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,230
Why can't you tell me about this one?

493
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,320
It's not that I can't.

494
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,320
I just don't think it's necessary.

495
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,420
Why is it not?

496
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,880
I mean...

497
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,100
I need to know everything
about Emmaly anyway.

498
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,080
The tale of the Emmalian kiss...

499
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,480
Among Emmalians, to kiss someone

500
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,000
is to seal a bond of love,

501
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,350
lasting until death do them part.

502
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,750
Well,

503
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,800
that was just a game.

504
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,080
Let's not take it too seriously.

505
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
A game?

506
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,810
What game did you guys play?

507
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,480
Nothing, Dad.

508
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,850
I think I'm going to bed now.

509
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,890
Have a good night.

510
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,200
Hold on.

511
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm glad, though,

512
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,140
that you're curious about Emmaly.

513
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,350
Among Emmalians, to kiss someone

514
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
is to seal a bond of love,

515
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,680
lasting until death do them part.

516
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,680
It's just a tale.

517
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,040
It's probably nothing.

518
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,610
Just 'cause our lips touched.

519
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,120
Fine, I'll get this straight with him.

520
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,670
Moreover,

521
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,390
I feel like we've been followed.

522
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,400
For that reason, Prince Khanin
must be taken back to Emmaly immediately

523
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,480
for his own safety.

524
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,510
Nin's been followed?

525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,720
Prince Khanin needs to be informed
of his royal lineage.

526
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,640
I'm well aware of that,

527
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,360
but he's not ready for the competition.

528
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,840
His Majesty's health
continues to decline.

529
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,660
According to the ancient laws of Emmaly,

530
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,910
the Royal Competition is to be held
upon His Majesty's abdication.

531
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,280
Therefore,
His Royal Highness must return

532
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,660
as the only heir
of the Assavadevathin clan.

533
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,360
I don't know how to tell him.

534
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,330
Through all these years,

535
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,750
he has grown as a son to me.

536
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,210
Nin...

537
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,520
Would anyone care to explain
what in the world is going on here?

538
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,510
Prince Khanin,

539
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,800
you carry the blood of royalty,

540
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,760
- and you must return to Emmaly.
- What are you talking about?

541
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,940
Dad,

542
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,330
what does he mean?

543
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,800
Dad...

544
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,480
You are Prince Khanin,
Your Royal Highness.

545
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,680
I am...

546
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,200
not your biological father.

547
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,560
That's not true.

548
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,710
Dad, I don't believe it.

549
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,320
Please forgive me
for hiding the truth all along.

550
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,080
This can't be true.

551
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,920
It's time

552
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,840
to return to Emmaly,
Your Royal Highness.

553
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,340
Dad, stop. Dad.

554
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,680
Stop it, Dad.

555
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,510
Look at me, Dad.

556
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,660
Stop bowing.

557
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,880
Come on, don't do this.

558
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,320
Dad...

559
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,080
What the hell is this?

560
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,000
Answer me.

561
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,520
Look at me, Dad.

562
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,580
Please don't do this.

563
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,160
I don't believe this.

564
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,030
Why do I have to take on
that foolish royal title?

565
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,280
All I ask is to be your son, Dad.

566
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,920
Dad,

567
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,800
can I please...

568
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,680
just be your son?

569
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,680
That's all I'm asking.

570
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:08,290
Dad,

571
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,680
answer me.

572
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,970
I got it wrong again.

573
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,570
It's okay.

574
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,330
Let's do it again.

575
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,330
Just take it easy.

576
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,040
Alright.

577
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,370
Mm.

578
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,710
Gosh, that was amazing.

579
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,740
You're the best.

580
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,130
- I'm quite good, though.
- Let's finish the song.

581
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,840
One, two, three, four.

582
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,230
I don't know how to tell him.

583
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,730
Through all these years,

584
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,560
he has grown as a son to me.

585
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:16,380
How did you get in here?

586
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,620
Get out.

587
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,360
It is my duty to protect

588
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,430
and take care of you,
Your Royal Highness.

589
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,830
Take care of me?

590
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,840
You're destroying my life.

591
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,540
Relax. Watch your step. Take it slow.

592
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,770
Nice. Go slow.

593
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,520
Left. Okay, attack.

594
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,290
- Dad...
- Good.

595
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,030
You won't go easy on me.

596
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,490
You're teasing me.

597
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm not. You just have to go all out.

598
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,400
Here, stop talking for now.

599
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,160
Nice. Give me more.

600
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,920
Remember, left and right.
Now, backward.

601
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,000
Hurry. Come on.

602
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Yes, faster.

603
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,800
Ouch.

604
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,790
Oh,

605
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:28,930
are you okay?

606
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:29,720
Oh...

607
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,480
Whoa, you cheated.

608
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,130
Yay, I won.

609
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,930
Does it count if you cheated?

610
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,960
- Did you really win?
- I did.

611
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,560
I lost.

612
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,560
I'm so bad at this.

613
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,600
It's okay.

614
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,890
Dad,

615
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,950
please explain everything to me.

616
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,560
You are Prince Khanin,

617
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,480
the only heir
of the Assavadevathin clan.

618
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,190
At this moment, your grandfather

619
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,100
sits on the throne

620
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,640
as the King of Emmaly.

621
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,620
You were less than a year old

622
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,330
when the tragedy happened.

623
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,530
The royal procession
of Princess Khunita,

624
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,690
your mother, was ambushed.

625
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,160
She did not survive the incident.

626
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,440
Prince Tharin lost
his beloved wife and son.

627
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,930
In Emmaly,

628
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,120
a royal funeral was held for them both.

629
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,930
Yet, the truth remains hidden
from all but a few.

630
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,520
His Majesty sent me in secret
to rescue you.

631
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,720
He commanded me

632
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,480
to take you into refuge with me.

633
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,910
Now,

634
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,430
the time has come

635
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,050
for you to return
to the family you were born into.

636
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,360
Nin,

637
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:23,910
are you still up?

638
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,760
I wanna talk to you.

639
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,820
All these years,

640
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,720
was I ever truly your son in your eyes?

641
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,280
It's not like that.

642
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,090
It's never been like that.

643
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,430
I'm not going to Emmaly.

644
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,360
They've discovered
that the Prince is here.

645
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,430
What?

646
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:12,130
We need to hurry.

647
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,720
What if he refuses to go?

648
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,890
He doesn't have a choice.

649
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,290
Why wouldn't I?

650
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,840
It's my life.

651
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,640
What's wrong with you?

652
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:58,850
Go.

653
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,770
Hurry, Nin.

654
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,660
Nin, run.

655
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:14,930
Dad.

656
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,560
- Dad...
- Nin.

657
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,260
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

658
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,160
Dad...

659
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,080
Dad!

660
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,890
Is this how you're gonna repay
your dad's efforts?

661
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,040
I'm going back to my dad.

662
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,040
You're only going
to get yourself caught.

663
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,650
If you don't trust me,

664
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,400
at least trust your dad.

665
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,320
How can we go to Emmaly from here?

666
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
I know a friend in Thailand.

667
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,560
He can help us.

668
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,820
No matter where you go,
they'll catch you either way.

669
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,460
Khanin is on his way back.

670
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,190
By this evening,

671
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,600
I shall declare
to the people that a new King

672
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,720
is to be chosen.
