1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,440
The winning heir

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,960
will secure their father's position
as the next King.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,080
If you wish to change Emmaly,

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,760
one way to do it

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,600
is to win the Competition.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm glad

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Ramil is putting more effort
into practicing than he used to.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,920
Let Mira be my coach.

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
Or I'll withdraw
from the Competition entirely.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,360
I would like you
to paint a portrait of me.

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,280
Do you like me?

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
Do you like me as much as I like you?

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Ran,

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,320
do you think it's even possible

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,920
for a royal to renounce their title?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Of course,

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,600
but only if they've come of age

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,039
and are capable
of making their own judgments.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
I don't want
the theoretical kind of answer.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,280
Just say it like how you would
as an ordinary art teacher.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,759
In that case,

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,400
maybe it would've been better
not to be royal at all.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,060
No royal rules,

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,460
obligations,

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,400
or heavy responsibilities.

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
That's true.

27
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,600
When you're not royal,

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
you'll be just an ordinary person

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
living peacefully.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
Then power won't matter.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
But if you must have it,

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,600
you should use it with justice

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
for the benefit of everyone.

34
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
You're right.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
If I ever have more power than I do now,

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
I'd want to use it as fairly as I can
for everyone as well.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,880
Whatever you choose to do

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,640
and whoever you become,

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
I'll be by your side.

40
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
The Royal Competition
is less than a week away.

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
The first round is a test of wit.

42
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,000
There's a good chance
the questions will ask for opinions

43
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
rather than factual knowledge.

44
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
So I've prepared some questions for you.

45
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,960
[The Royal Competition: Test of Wit]

46
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,840
The breeze today
stirs more than the leaves.

47
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
It brings with it
wishes of good fortune to this land.

48
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
Seeing Your Majesty so joyful,

49
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I believe your health
is improving day by day.

50
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,360
I have faith that
once the Royal Competition concludes,

51
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,880
Khanin will bring the throne to Tharin.

52
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,580
It's been a long time.

53
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,340
I've been waiting all this time
for this day to come.

54
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,940
You have borne much hardship
for your own clan, Your Majesty.

55
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,120
I humbly offer
my heartfelt congratulations beforehand.

56
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,000
Great.

57
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,159
That's great.

58
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
That's the best wish.

59
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
I shall accept your congratulations
ahead of time.

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,240
The first round,
which allows public voting,

61
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,280
should not pose any difficulty
for Prince Khanin.

62
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,320
His Royal Highness has been cherished
by the people.

63
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,760
He is sure to win.

64
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Indeed.

65
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Introducing this additional round

66
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,560
is meant to benefit him.

67
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,680
But as for the archery round ahead,

68
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,730
why would you consent
to Prince Chana's demands, Your Majesty?

69
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,040
What do you think?

70
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Well...

71
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
From my humble consideration,

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
might this be...

73
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,360
to prevent favoritism
toward the Assavadevathins?

74
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,120
At times, power is needed
to subdue people,

75
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,600
yet kindness toward them

76
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,160
also helps keep their hearts at peace.

77
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,200
By letting Ava, a woman, participate

78
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,480
and adding a competition
that suits her strengths,

79
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,800
it shall keep Ramil in check.

80
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,880
However,

81
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,240
wouldn't this put Prince Khanin
at a disadvantage, Your Majesty?

82
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Wirun,

83
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
you are intelligent.

84
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,710
Still,

85
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,200
you've never held power before.

86
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Giving hope to people

87
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,760
is such an irresistible temptation.

88
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,520
Ava's talent lies in archery,

89
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,320
but she'll never beat
the male heirs in fencing.

90
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,280
So that's how it is.

91
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,760
I am merely of lowly status

92
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,490
and could never hope
to have such wisdom, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,480
What a truly wonderful day this is.

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's head to the hall, shall we?

95
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

96
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Your Royal Highness,

97
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,480
are you feeling stressed?

98
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,630
I gave you a complete makeover!

99
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,950
That hair is so cute, neat, and elegant.

100
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,520
Let's have some tea.

101
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560

102
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Tea...

103
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't get too worked up.

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,920
Just stick to what you've learned.

105
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,040
I've checked around.

106
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
Everything's alright.

107
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
It's really happening now.

108
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm afraid...

109
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
that I might mess up.

110
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
You've got this, Nin.

111
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,880
We've prepared so much together.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,280
Don't worry, okay?

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,560
What if...

114
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,800
Whatever the result may be,

115
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,710
I'll always be right here.

116

117
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
try not to worry too much.

118
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Have some tea to help calm your mind.

119
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Seems like
you're more worked up than me.

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Oh...

121
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,080
Gosh...

122
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
There's no tea left.

123
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
Oh, well...

124
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll get you another cup.

125
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,800
Gosh,

126
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
this isn't better.

Don't worry, my dear.

128
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,920
Just do your best.

please never doubt my love for you.

132
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,080
I have loved you since 22 years ago,
and I still do.

Before,

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,920
I kept it quiet,

135
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,840
not wanting to make you feel uneasy.

136
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,320
But now,

137
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,700
you're very strong and dignified.

I mean the rules this time
differ from previous Competitions.

answer questions,

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
Jay!

187
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,440
So you took a prince to the protest?

188
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,120
That's freaking dope.

189
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Whoa.

190
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,090
I think...

191
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,200
Jay probably just found out
about it, too.

192
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,160
[Arm: That Calvin who joined the protest
is a prince?]

193
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
As His Majesty
values the voice of the people,

194
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,200
he's decreed that this round
be decided by the Emmalians

195
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,920
through public voting.

196
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,740
Voting?

197
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,220
That's never been part of it.

198
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,880
It's just voting.

199
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,640
Who knows what goes on
behind the scenes?

200
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,030
The time is now upon us.

201
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,060
I hereby declare
the Royal Competition of Emmaly

202
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,320
officially open.

203
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,100
And the first to answer the question is

204
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,840
Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut.

205
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,920
Please stand on the designated podium,
Your Royal Highness.

206
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,720
The question for Prince Ramil
is as follows:

207
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,140
Could you identify
some long-standing issues in our nation

208
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,170
that have been overlooked

209
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,200
and failed to address?

210
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,120
Please share your answer
with the people, Your Royal Highness.

211
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
That's not the question
from the committee, is it?

212
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
It is not, Your Majesty.

213
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
I shall look into it immediately.

214
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
It is too late now.

215
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,990
From here on,

216
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,030
just make sure nothing else goes wrong.

217
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,750
In my view,

219
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
every issue in Emmaly matters

220
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,240
and deserves to be addressed.

221
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,120
But if I were to choose one
that remains in the shadows,

222
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
it would be...

223
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,720
a family-related issue.

224
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,200
The numbers from last year
may seem small,

225
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,040
only four to five thousand
reported cases,

226
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,800
but this is not about statistics.

227
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,600
It's about people.

228
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
Domestic violence,

229
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
often aimed at women and children,

230
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
leaves lasting wounds
on both body and mind.

231
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
That was a stupid thing to do.

232
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,760
But it's a misguided notion,

233
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,720
ingrained over time

234
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,040
and passed down through generations.

235
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
They were taught

236
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
it encourages discipline...

237
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,880
You'll remain silent?

238
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
And obedience.

239
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,040
In truth, it has caused
generations of pain.

240
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,440
It damages confidence,

241
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,240
creates all kinds of trauma,

242
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,440
and isolates them from society.

243
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,630
When a person is denied the chance
to grow into their best self,

244
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,480
the nation loses a part of its future.

245
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,400
I truly believe

246
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
children are the future of our nation

247
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
and of this world.

248
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,520
And that is why...

249
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
this issue must be addressed.

250
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
Thank you for your answer,
Your Royal Highness.

251
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,180
Next,

252
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Princess Ava Davichmetha,
please stand on the podium.

253
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,400
If you could change one law in Emmaly,

254
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,640
which law would you choose to amend,
Your Royal Highness?

255
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,360
For generations, the laws of our nation
have been written by men,

256
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,860
which led to some being unjust
toward women

257
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
and gender-diverse people.

258
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,720
While we have achieved
marriage equality,

259
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,560
deeper understanding
is still lacking in other areas.

260
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,920
Stop asking so many questions.

261
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,360
A woman is training you.

262
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
Don't you think
those two clans will laugh at us?

263
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,680
I would propose laws
to ensure equal pay,

264
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,540
increase political representation
for women...

265
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,180
We have adhered to this tradition
for generations.

266
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,720
You must understand that women
do not have the same rights as men.

267
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,340
And promote
greater participation of women

268
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,400
in government
and international organizations.

269
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,880
Our education policies
should also be reformed

270
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,080
to eliminate gender bias.

271
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
Why are there only male vendors?

272
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,160
None of them are female.

273
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,620
In Meenanagarin,

274
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,800
it's believed that the husband
should provide for the family

275
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,400
while the wife is responsible
for the housework.

276
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,180
With these reforms,

277
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,960
Emmaly will move
toward a fairer legal system,

278
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,400
one that protects women's rights
in the long term.

279
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,960
Thank you for your answer, Princess Ava.

280
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,040
Next,

281
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,280
it will be the question
for Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

282
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Please come to the podium.

283
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,150
If given the opportunity,

284
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,030
what strategies would you recommend

285
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,560
to stimulate the economy of Emmaly?

286
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,530
Our nation, Emmaly, has so much to offer

287
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,930
from its fascinating culture

288
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,490
to its exquisite cuisine.

289
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,250
Personally,

290
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,090
I've always had a fondness
for Davin spaghetti sauce.

291
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,640
With its food, culture, and traditions,
Emmaly has great potential

292
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,040
to grow its soft power
on the global stage.

293
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,720
Nin...

294
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,720
You've raised him well.

295
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
Thanks.

296
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I think...

297
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
he surely misses you a lot.

298
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,920
Emmaly is also home to four regions,

299
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,240
each with its own unique charm.

300
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,800
I personally love Bhuchongpisut,
an ancient city,

301
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,800
for its deep historical roots.

302
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,120
I also love the nightlife
in Davichmetha,

303
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,760
when joy fills the city.

304
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I love how welcoming our nation is.

305
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
The people are friendly

306
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,120
even to someone like me, a prince.

307
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,400
And the sea of Meenanagarin

308
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
is so breathtakingly beautiful.

309
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,040
Most of all,

310
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,680
what touches me the most is
the lantern procession in Assavadevathin,

311
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,880
a tradition that honors the beliefs
and the way of life of our miners,

312
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,000
the backbone of our economy.

313
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
By connecting with the people
throughout Emmaly,

314
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,160
I've learned that

315
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,240
our nation's greatest treasure

316
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
is its kind,

317
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
welcoming people,

318
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,240
who embrace visitors
from around the world.

319
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,960
If we promote local culture
through thoughtful campaigns

320
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,700
and ensure the revenue goes back
to local communities,

321
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,880
empowering them to support themselves,

322
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,800
we can truly strengthen
our tourism economy.

323
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,760
But before implementing
any economic strategies,

324
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,760
we must first
address a pressing concern.

325
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,040
The dust pollution
caused by mining in Assavadevathin

326
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,880
has harmed Emmaly's air quality
for years.

327
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
By solving this issue immediately

328
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
in tandem with enhancing the economy,

329
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,720
we can enhance both economic growth

330
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,310
and the nation's quality of life.

331
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
Thank you.

332
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,400
Thank you for your answer,
Prince Khanin.

333
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,920
[First Round of Royal Competition:
Test of Wit]

334
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,200
And with that, all the competitors

335
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,800
have completed their answers
to the three questions.

336
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,640
We are now entering the voting.

337
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,560
All Emmalians,
you may now cast your votes

338
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,680
for the royal candidate of your choice.

339
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,360
Prince Khanin's answer

340
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
was lit.

341
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,040
Someone in power finally said
what needed to be said.

342
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
I'm glad.

343
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,520
Jay...

344
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,680
Jay!

345
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,440
Jay!

346
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,840
What's wrong?

347
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,180
Uh...

348
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
I'm glad, too.

349
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,280
The princess truly showed empathy
toward women.

350
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,680
I'm voting for her.

351
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,040
Yeah, she nailed it.

352
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,560
I liked the education policy reforms.

353
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,560
I prefer Prince Ramil, though.

354
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,400
He seemed to
really understand family issues.

355
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,260
Still, it looked like

356
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,480
Prince Khanin understood
Emmaly's problems on a bigger scale.

357
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,580
Exactly.

358
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,970
I think we should vote for him.

359
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,760
Right.

360
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,600
[Wow, Prince Khanin
even mentioned the pollution issue]

361
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,480
[He spoke about the dust problem
we've been calling out]

362
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,400
[I'm sure he's getting many votes;
that was a great answer]

363
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Three,

364
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,920
two,

365
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,840
one,

366
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
the voting has officially ended.

367
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,480
The votes from everyone
all across Emmaly

368
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,200
have been counted and recorded.

369
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,520
It's now time to announce

370
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,680
the competitor who has received
the highest number of votes.

371
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
The competitor with the most votes is...

372
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,600
Prince Ramil of Bhuchongpisut!

373
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I offer my sincere congratulations
to His Royal Highness.

374
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,440
However, the Royal Competition
is not yet over.

375
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,960
Two more rounds still lie ahead.

376
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,090
The next round

377
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,560
will be an archery competition,
taking place in Meenanagarin

378
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,120
in just three days' time.

379
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,560
Seems like the people really adore him.

380
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,040
Congratulations, Rachata.

381
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,120
I humbly offer my congratulations,
Your Royal Highness.

382
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,920
No need to feel down, Brother.

383
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,120
I know you've always had
strong public support.

384
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,880
It's just that...

385
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,400
perhaps they connected more
with my answer.

386
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,960
Your words...

387
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,880
sound almost like you're insulting us.

388
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Come on, Ava.

389
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,159
Don't be so harsh on me.

390
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,659
What's it called again?

391
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,239
Consolation!

392
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,360
I'm only consoling you.

393
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,880
The Competition is still ongoing.

394
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,400
I don't think
this is the right moment to do so.

395
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,440
In fact, if our answers

396
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,960
truly bring about solutions
to the nation's issues,

397
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,679
it serves the people's best interests.

398
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,880
There's nothing that needs consolation.

399
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
Khanin's right.

400
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
I agree with him.

401
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Why am I getting ganged up on?

402
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,120
That couldn't be.

403
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,480
The three of us have been rivals
for a long while.

404
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,520
That's right.

405
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,510
I'll see you in the next round.

406
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,480
May I have a word with you?

407
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,280
I truly admire your courage

408
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,120
in answering the question
the way you did.

409
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,600
The way I did?

410
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,280
You spoke out
about the issues in Assavadevathin.

411
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,280
It had to be said by someone.

412
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,920
The more powerful our voice is,

413
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,240
the more we must use it.

414
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,320
You've also done a wonderful job
speaking up for equal rights.

415
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It was my own experience
that gave me the courage to speak up.

416
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,560
And now that I have said it,
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

417
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
I may have lost this round,

418
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,560
but I may not the next time.

419
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,320
I'm not planning to lose, either.

420
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Did I handle Ramil's words well?

421
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Father,

422
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,120
I did it.

423
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,600
That's enough to make you happy?

424
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
I believe...

425
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
it feels like
a promising beginning for us.

426
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Obviously.

427
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
I did it with my own hands.

428
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,600
You?

429
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,120
Can't imagine you winning anything.

430
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,200
Who do you work for?

431
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,440
His Majesty the King!

432
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,800
He was sent by the King,
Your Royal Highness.

433
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,440
That old man

434
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,360
is always up to lowly deeds.

435
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,120
The only way for us to survive

436
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,920
is to win

437
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,640
and reclaim our glory.

438
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
It could be risky.

439
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,040
I don't care, okay?

440
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,140
Get the vote rigging done discreetly.

441
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,640
No matter what,

442
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Ramil's votes
have to secure first place.

443
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,880
I've set a ladder up for you.

444
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,570
Father, you mean...

445
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,120
All you have to do

446
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,920
is to get to the top.

447
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
No mistakes allowed.

448
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,560
Do you understand, Ramil?

449
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Yes, Father.

450
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
I appreciate you walking with me.

451
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I have to.

452
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,000
My friends were pretty loud, though.

453
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,360
They were annoying you, right?

454
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm sorry.

455
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,240
I didn't say that.

456
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Being around people is actually fun,

457
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,840
and our home's usually pretty quiet.

458
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Come on, cut the drama.

459
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,840
I'm totally fine.

460
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,300
You're the one feeling down.

461
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,560
I brought you out for a walk

462
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,400
to get some fresh air

463
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,440
and hopefully feel better.

464
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,080
[Calvin: Can we talk?]

465
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,360
Was that from Calvin?

466
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
Wait, no.

467
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,280
It's Prince Calvin, right?

468
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah.

469
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,360
Why?

470
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,520
Now that he's a prince,

471
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,240
you don't want to talk to him anymore?

472
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
I don't know.

473
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
I don't even know
how I'm supposed to feel.

474
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,440
Just go clear things up with him.

475
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,080
It's just impossible, no matter what.

476
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,160
Jay,

477
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,420
if you guys don't talk,

478
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,340
nothing's gonna get better.

479
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,240
If you don't want to talk to him,

480
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,480
just tell him straight up.

481
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,000
It's that simple.

482
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Seriously?

483
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,360
Someone like me,

484
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,040
telling him to leave me alone?

485
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Jay,

486
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
life is unpredictable.

487
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
We never know when we'll meet again,

488
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
or if it will be the last time.

489
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,100
Either way, go sort things out with him.

490
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,520
Let's take a look at this news.

491
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,040
It began with a video

492
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
that recently surfaced online.

493
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,800
The video shows
a pollution protest taking place.

494
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,320
What stands out is
the presence of Prince Calvin of Bhujar

495
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,160
walking among the protesters.

496
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Jay!

497
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Jay!

498
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,360
Can I come in?

499
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Is June not home?

500
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,880
She's in her room.

501
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,280
Can I sit with you?

502
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,560
There's something I need to explain.

503
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,640
What's there to explain?

504
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
It's just that...

505
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
you...

506
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Actually, no.

507
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,560
I can't even talk to you
like this anymore.

508
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,920
Can we just talk like before?

509
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,680
I'm afraid I cannot,
Your Royal Highness.

510
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,880
That would be improper.

511
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,240
Are you saying...

512
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,160
you're just gonna walk away from me?

513
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,640
We were never meant to meet this way...

514
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,680
Your Royal Highness.

515
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,320
Don't do that, Jay.

516
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,640
I didn't even deserve...

517
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
to hear the truth from you,
Your Royal Highness.

518
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Honestly,

519
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,160
I really meant to tell you.

520
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,600
After the protest,

521
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,680
I'd like to talk to you.

522
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,640
At the protest?

523
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:08,920
Yes.

524
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,360
But with everything coming up...

525
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,320
I'm here today to apologize.

526
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,440
And to bid farewell.

527
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,400
I've been commanded to return to Bhujar.

528
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,160
I'm sorry.

529
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,160
I'm truly sorry.

530
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,800
It is beyond my place to accept
your apology, Your Royal Highness.

531
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,760
We should not meet ever again.

532
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,560
Please take your leave.

533
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,670
I said,

534
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,560
Please take your leave.

535
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,280

[A day before the archery competition]

537
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
I am certain now,

538
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,480
so I rushed here to tell you.

539
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,840
What is it about, Father?

540
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,120
According to my sources,

541
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,920
Rachata rigged the voting last time,

542
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,280
so Ramil won that round.

[The Royal Competition: Archery]

Welcome to the second round
of the Royal Competition.

This round features an archery match.

are now ready to compete.

All you have to do

is to get to the top.

You must do whatever it takes
to win this Competition.

552
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,000
If you wish to change Emmaly,

553
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,840
one way to do it

554
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,080
is to win the Competition.

555
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,600
If all competitors are ready,

556
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,320
I shall now declare
the archery competition

557
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,160
officially underway.

00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800

560
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,480
one,

561
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,560
begin.

562
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,600
Do you not trust

563
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,280
His Majesty, Your Royal Highness?
[Meet me in Assavadevathin]

564

Do it for Khanin.

566
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,720
I lost him once,

567
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,400
and I cannot bear to lose him again.

568
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,960

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320

00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,360
everyone's just hungry for power.

572
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,160
