1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm not going to run away.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,440
The secret about the farm

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,760
is no longer related to the enemy.

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
There will be no one to stop us from going to Emily.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm going back to the island.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,560
I'll take care of the situation in the future.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
You know

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,280
how dangerous it is to lose power

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,840
before the battle.

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,760
I'm sick.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,720
I dare to risk my life.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,960
I don't believe

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,680
anyone can take care of Emily as well as you.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
For Emily,

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,920
I must be the new prince of the throne.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,080
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,960

But I think...

168
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,280
Your Majesty,

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
I will take you to the palace

Please down the task.

195
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,280
Seal the camera and put no one bowing at that time.

I have been watching you sing for a long time.

197
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
Listen.

198
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,160
When you became pregnant and abandoned me,

199
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,680
every step you take,

200
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,080
you will only find my form of relief.

201
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,840
I have taken everything to see you.

202
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,880
Are you looking for a real life?

203
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Don't worry, she is just a Model Girl.

204
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
Sa has disappeared.

205
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,240
Can you still feel her voice?

206
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Nothing?

207
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Why as long as I have given up

208
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I'm here to wait for my father.

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I'm not here to take the position of the prince.

210
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Well, I...

211
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
How are you?

212
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Did you call me?

213
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I'm fine, Your Majesty.

214
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I've brought the tea to you.

215
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
But...

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Something happened.

217
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
That's why I can't see you now.

218
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
How is my son?

219
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Is he injured?

220
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,880
He's fine.

221
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
How is your nephew?

222
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

223
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I'm fine.

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm worried about him.

225
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I don't know how he is now.

226
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Don't worry about it.

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I've found out about Tat-ta-nai.

228
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
He's still alive.

229
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
I've reported to the police.

230
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
About the murderer,

231
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,880
there are only a few people who know about his return.

232
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
One of the murderer is Emily's police.

233
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
I believe it's definitely his son.

234
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
If so,

235
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
I'll go and find out if he's still alive.

236
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Don't worry about the duty of the prince.

237
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
I'll find someone to take care of it.

238
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I'll go now.

239
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Your Majesty,

240
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
can we please get in here for a moment?

241
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
I think we should get out of here and go.

242
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
There's no need for that now.

243
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I believe everything your Majesty and the people here have done

244
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
was well ésposed to be done.

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
This man is an improved sauce panwhere.

246
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Is all the rice in the hotel

247
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:21,760
done after he Fatei

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
This is a machine that has been developed in our emerald country.

249
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
It's a modern technology and available in every city.

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
No matter how much we try to improve it,

251
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
we still keep this product well.

252
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,760
This is the room for the emperor of the gods.

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,760
I wonder if you have a special design?

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Do I have to dress like this?

255
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Dressing in the emperor, you have to dress in the emperor's style.

256
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
If it's an important opportunity or not...

257
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
Aomansinpujing Entertainment City 891891.com

258
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,760
The ceremony must be arranged in order.

259
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,760
So today is an important occasion?

260
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Yes, it is.

261
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,760
In a moment, we must watch the emperor's life.

262
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
The emperor's life is the most important.

263
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Including all the important families.

264
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
I would like to thank the emerald country.

265
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,760

266
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Why looks looking So cute

267

Emak 66

268
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
Is there no other place?

269
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
Since today,

270
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,720
I must go to the temple to guard the living god

271
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,920
and dress him in this costume.

272
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,480
What are you doing?

273
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
I can change it myself.

274
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm sorry, Fahbad.

275
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
Don't hold the sword.

276
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,280
But...

277
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,080
What?

278
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,720
Hey.

279
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,960
No.

280
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
I said I would help you.

281
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
No, I can change it myself.

282
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,280
Hey.

283
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
I can change it myself.

284
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
I can change it myself.

285
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:50,880
I...

286
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,760
I said I would help you.

287
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,280
I said I would help you.

288
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,840
Is it too tight?

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Erm...

290
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,200
Yes?

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,960
Isn't it quite tight?

292
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,720
I'll give you more to test it.

293
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
I just need to use an adjustable sword

294
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,680
and a很有 battleship.

295
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh!

296
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,480
I feel like I just got Runway V 베 mistaken.

297
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,680
Are you really invited to be there with us?

298
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm seeing that again.

299
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,880
【F THAN KMO TING】

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,000

303
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,680
Good afternoon.

I'm

00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,520

Let's go.

308
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:14,960
Let's go.

309
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,040
Crossing the street.

310
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,720
Is it this road?

311
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,980
Then, where shall we go?

312
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,660
There's an emergency.

313
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,600
Where can we turn?

314
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,180
Turn left around this way?

315
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,080
No.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,940
Turn right.

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,000
Then, turn left.

318
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,380
Turn left.

319
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
Hey, you.

320
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
I will take my leave now.

321
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm very happy to see my nephew still alive.

322
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm here to take the place of Meena Nakkarin.

323
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,240
I'm very happy to see my nephew and my nephew Tharin.

324
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,240
I'm very happy to see you, Your Majesty.

325
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Your Majesty, I'm very happy to see you.

326
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Thank you.

327
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
It's a good thing.

328
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I'm very happy to see you.

329
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Don't say that.

330
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
You can decide if you want to be a marksman.

331
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Do not prevent it.

332
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,240
I don't believe you.

333
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I will never go to such a place.

334
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
It may painsIMe now

335
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
then should do it.

336
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
I'm the leader of the Yusuk family.

337
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm the head of the Tawan Aung tribe.

338
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,240
I'm the leader of the Yusuk family.

339
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm the leader of the Tawan Aung tribe.

340
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm the leader of the Yusuk family.

341
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
You're so smart.

342
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,240
You're so smart.

343
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
We've checked and received the DNA.

344
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
We've checked and received the DNA.

345
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:49,340
Establishing,

346
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,340
Establishing,

347
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,440
What kind of family sit we'd like to move into?

348
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
No one can regret helping you.

349
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,920
His Majesty still doesn't think you are strengthen enough.

350
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,840
connecting to his court,

351
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,960
he will see the result.

352
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,320
The real king is an expert.

353
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,720
Man as a man.

354
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,080
Father,

355
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
let me have a speech.

356
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960

And now next to the

Listen to your model.

Master Su.

362
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,680
Stop them.

363
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,560
Give me a hand.

364
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,120
Okay, assistant prostitute.

I'm so glad that our family is here to eat with us today.

370
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I've been waiting for 22 years.

371
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Thank you for coming back to me.

372
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
I'm glad that you're back to live with us.

373
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Do you like the food?

374
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
If you want anything special, I can tell you.

375
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll let the chef handle it.

376
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
The prince Tharin or the son of the emperor,

377
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
is the heir of the king of life, the leader of the Asawat family.

378
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
The emperor of this city is on the golden side.

379
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Prince Tharin has a man of the king.

380
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
He has a car.

381
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,100
He is the son of the emperor.

382
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I can eat everything.

383
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
The food on the table looks delicious.

384
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Everything is delicious.

385
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
The food is delicious.

386
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
The house is decorated with delicious food.

387
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
The room is decorated with delicious food.

388
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Do you like spaghetti?

389
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
My dad wants me to eat delicious food.

390
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
So he often cooks this menu.

391
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
I often eat this menu.

392
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
I mean,

393
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Father Tharnnai...

394
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
When you're with him,

395
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
you must have practiced martial arts, right?

396
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Another thing, you must know that

397
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
in our country,

398
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
there are the best martial arts athletes.

399
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I practice with my father every day.

400
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
You are a very good martial artist.

401
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
You used to be a coach for Tharin.

402
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
And you were a teacher

403
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,100
who taught you martial arts since your mother was pregnant.

404
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
When you were in England,

405
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
did you teach martial arts

406
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
to prepare for competitions?

407
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Yes.

408
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Martial arts competition?

409
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Yes.

410
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Your nephew is your nephew.

411
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
He is my nephew.

412
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
He is a good candidate

413
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
to compete in the competition

414
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
of the martial arts competition.

415
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
He will bring the best of his father.

416
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Actually, I came here

417
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
to wait for your father.

418
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
I'm sorry.

419
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
I'm sorry.

420
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,100
I don't want to compete in the competition.

421
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I don't want to compete in the competition.

422
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Please tell everyone.

423
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
I understand.

424
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
It's not about the competition.

425
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
It's about the position of the heir.

426
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
It doesn't matter if you accept it or not.

427
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
You are still my nephew.

428
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
I'm going to the stage.

430
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Don't follow me.

431
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Okay.

432
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
Is everything okay?

433
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Yes.

434
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Give me a hug.

435
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Father.

436
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Did I call her specifically?

437
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,900
Why do you say that I won't compete?

438
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,100
I understand.

439
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,860
I never intend to force you.

440
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,140
I want you to take time to adjust yourself.

441
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,660
If you feel uncomfortable

442
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,100
or want something special,

443
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,260
you can always tell me.

444
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,580
Even though I'm not in Dao Wun,

445
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm not far from the temple.

446
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,700
We shall help one another,

447
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:35,220
together

448
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,940
and day by day.

449
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,180
I'm not here to waste my time.

450
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,140
But if something has to happen,

451
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,180
why am I here?

452
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,980
You can ruin it.

453
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,580
Ruin?

454
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,580
Stop.

455
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,300
I will help you find out the truth.

456
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,660
Min,

457
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,340
you have been through a lot of bad things.

458
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,580
After this,

459
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,900
can you give me a chance to protect your child?

460
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,260
For what?

461
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,980
Human

462
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,140
and I...

463
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,580
Oh...

464
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,740
Min, thanks.

465
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,180
It's really late now.

466
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,820
I shouldn't bother you.

467
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,540
I have to go.

468
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Be a happy girl.

469
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,900
Don't worry.

470
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,180
We'll get along well since it was their methods.

471
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,460
If youonnege championed the vaping contest,

472
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,700
you'd be at 10 enabled.

473
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,860
Who to tag along is tomorrow's character.

474
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,860
But,

475
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,860
the secret of the secret is to protect my nephew.

476
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
I think it's a good idea.

477
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,860
When my nephew returns to Emory,

478
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
it's a good thing.

479
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,860
When the angel of heaven comes back like this,

480
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,860
the emperor will probably hold a royal ceremony.

481
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Who knows?

482
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,860
I don't know why he's going to hold a competition.

483
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
When he came to receive the angel,

484
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,860
he said that the angel of heaven

485
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,860
wanted to be on the throne the next day.

486
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,860
Have you thought too much, Your Majesty?

487
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
We haven't seen anything happen yet.

488
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,860
I've got news about Mr.Hanai.

489
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
The house where Mr.Hanai was born in England

490
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
was burned down and has not been rebuilt.

491
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
There was also a body burned down in the house.

492
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,860
It's hard to tell who it is.

493
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,860
But I've asked the person who led the part to prove

494
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,860
that the body is exactly the same as Mr.Hanai.

495
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
If the evidence shows who it is,

496
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
I will report it to you as soon as possible.

497
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,860
I will report it to you as soon as possible.

499
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
I will report it to you as soon as possible.

500
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Don't report it to the emperor.

501
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
This is the body of Mr.Hanai.

502
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,860
If this body can't be cut off from the old man,

503
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
and only think about the past,

504
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
how can it grow stronger than this emery?

505
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,860
How can it grow stronger than this emery?

506
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Take the sad news of Mr.Hanai to the emperor.

507
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Believe me, everything will be better.

508
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
What did you say?

509
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Mr.Tao.

510
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
Tell me what you said just now.

511
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
Say it again.

512
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,860
The funeral is over.

513
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
The funeral is over.

514
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Don't cry.

515
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
Don't cry.

516
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Don't cry.

517
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Don't cry.

518
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Don't cry.

519
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
I will tell you everything.

520
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
I will tell you everything.

521
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
I will tell you...

522
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
What happened?

523
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,040
Miss.

524
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,380
She didn't blend me into 그랬ring the moon.

525
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,600
I wouldn't be able to learn to appreciate her and be with her.

526
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,200
What is it?

527
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,860
I want you to be my friend.

528
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
I want to be alone.

529
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Then you can be my friend.

530
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
I'm sorry.

531
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
I'm sorry

532
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,860
for what I did to you.

533
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,860
I think it's inappropriate

534
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
for you to do this.

535
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
What do you mean?

536
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
We've slept together for many nights.

537
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Why is it inappropriate now?

538
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,860
I have something to talk to you.

539
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
I'm sorry.

540
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
I'm sorry.

542
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,860
If I don't join this competition,

543
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I will be a traitor to your family.

544
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Everything

545
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,860
depends on my decision.

546
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,220
Everyone will respect Faban's decision.

547
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,900
And you?

548
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,260
Do you want me to compete?

549
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,260
I want to see Faban compete.

550
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:26,940
You!

551
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,020
Open your mouth.

552
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm your boss,

553
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,540
not your sister.

554
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,700
If that goes on,

555
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,220
would you let him decide her heart?

556
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,500
There's not much we can do.

557
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,380
No need.

558
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,980
Don't forget me.

559
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,660
Apart from the powder...

560
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,660
Qiao Weirdo.

561
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,540
I have this amnesty,

562
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,940
it is to steal her body,

563
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:07,720
it's to

564
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,500
Pray to our Lord King Mr Right.

565
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
That day,

566
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,140
we're about to meet.

567
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Finally,

568
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,080
our Lord King...

569
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,620
will come down.

570
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
To receive this amnesty,

571
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,820
it's to

572
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,300
rule over the posterity ofMary.

573
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:50,660
...

574
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,660
Do you have thoughts here?

575
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,460
I have heard you said you know the theory.

576
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,860
I have been to all я Universe Store.

577
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,900
It's beyond my comprehension.

578
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,740
Brother, are you a murderer too?

579
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,620
Are youuckle by me?

580
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,620
I want to see the sky fall down.

581
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,260
Lin!

582
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,820
Run!

583
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,420
Lin!

584
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,860
No matter what,

585
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,780
power is the most important thing.

586
00:39:49,620 --> 00:40:15,400
** Fighting Battle

587
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,900
At the end of the story

588
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,520
I promised to fly a balloon

589
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,360
But�

590
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,460
I didn't and I fell

591
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,440
After flying a balloon

592
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,220
Blindfolded

593
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,660
broken

594
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,060
It's said that the most powerful and the most powerful

595
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,260
will join the royal family.

596
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,260
Why don't you have the right to do so?

597
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,860
But there's no woman in this family who can compete.

598
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,260
I think it's a family that has been investigated.

599
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,260
You must understand that women have no right to compete with men.

600
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,460
I will compete in this kingdom.

601
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,860
The law doesn't say that women are not allowed to compete.

602
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,660
It's just what everyone believes. That's all.

603
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,060
The law says that the representative must prove his ability.

604
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,060
If you follow this law, you have the right to prove yourself.

605
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,660
I think so, too.

606
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,260
Nowadays, men and women are equal.

607
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,860
No matter what gender you are,

608
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,860
you should be able to compete.

609
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,260
I think about it again.

610
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,860
I think what you said is true.

611
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,060
I also want to announce that

612
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,060
the representative of the Twitch Meta

613
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,460
can join the competition.

614
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,460
The representative of Twitch Meta and Asawat Theewatin

615
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,460
will join the royal family.

616
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,660
I hope everyone can train themselves well.

617
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
The meeting is over.

618
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,860
Don't mention your child.

619
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,460
His mother made a promise of marriage that my child can see.

620
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,140
My team has just started,

621
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,740
I'm not suspension from the competition.

622
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,500
I think my teammates

623
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,100
can give meen

624
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,740
a chance to compete.

625
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,220
It will be fun

626
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,980
if they can offer me

627
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,100
the chance to compete.

628
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,580
You are all used to讓

629
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,520
But this is Tiancun.

630
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Too many people still come and say he's my brother.

631
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,060
Thank you for caring about me.

632
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,960
Thank you for today.

633
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
He dared to kill a Master.

634
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,020
You takich ridicules.

635
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,740
No matter what happens,

636
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,540
once your mission is completed,

637
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,900
it will be cells for you.

638
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,100
How could you have the whole day

639
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Checkmate.

640
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,820
Has anyone seen Mr. Charan?

641
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,260
I think he's going to the art college.

642
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,340
Why is he still studying at the college?

643
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Are you going to teach him?

644
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,540
Teach him?

645
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,940
Teach him?

646
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,940
Mr. Charan is going to the art college.

647
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,940
Teach him?

648
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,940
Actually, he's very good at art.

649
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,340
Most importantly,

650
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,140
he's a teacher at Morpheus University.

651
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,340
He's a member of the Pithak Theewa family.

652
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,740
Morpheus?

653
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,940
Morpheus.

654
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,940
I'm curious.

655
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,740
I thought he's only good at fighting.

656
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,740
I want to know if he's good at art.

657
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,340
Say it.

658
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,140
I got this from the criminal

659
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,540
when he was being followed.

660
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,740
You didn't give it to me.

661
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,540
Is it a fake?

662
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,740
I checked it.

663
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,940
Why would he create evidence to frame himself?

664
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,940
Because he didn't care.

665
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,340
Okay.

666
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,740
I'll go check on him.

667
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,740
Okay.

668
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,140
I'll go check on him.

669
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,940
That's it?

670
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,540
Why did you call me back?

671
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,140
There's one more thing.

672
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,740
Can you help me find that person?

673
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,940
Who?

674
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,140
The person from England.

675
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,740
He's not here now.

676
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,740
He's been killed.

677
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,940
He's still alive.

678
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,740
But I don't know where he is.

679
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,140
You can explain it to me.

680
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,140
Okay.

681
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,740
I'll explain it to you.

682
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,540
I want you to find that person.

683
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,740
The soldier who's taking care of the English general.

684
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,140
But this

685
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,740
has to be kept a secret.

686
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,940
Okay.

687
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,940
Come, let's make a paper test.

688
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,740
What can I get you?

689
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,140
Pang.

690
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,340
This is why

691
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,340
you asked me to come.

692
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,740
I came to look for you too.

693
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,940
Are you okay?

694
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,940
Get out of my way.

695
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
Doctor.

696
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,940
Your call is so random.

697
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,940
No, doctor. I just met the doctor.

698
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,940
I'll go to the toilet.

699
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Don't go to the toilet.

700
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
I'm sorry.

701
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,940
Why are you sorry?

702
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,940
You didn't hit me.

703
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,940
Bring the car to the time zone.

704
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,940
Bring it here.

705
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,940
Fahbaz.

706
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,940
I think we should go back now.

707
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,940
Someone can remember me.

708
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,940
I'll call that person.

709
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:11,940
I'll take Fahbaz back.

710
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,940
Yes, doctor.

711
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:18,940
Fahbaz is here, doctor.

712
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,940
I'm sorry.

713
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,940
I'm sorry.

714
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,940
Excuse me.

715
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:10,940
Where are you going?

716
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,940
I'll be here tonight.

717
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,940
Why?

718
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,940
Can't we be together?

719
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,940
You're really leaving me, right?

720
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,940
Thank you, Fahbaz.

721
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,940
I'm done with my duty here.

722
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
Stop right now.

723
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,940
You have no right to go anywhere.

724
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,940
You.

725
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,940
Thank you for understanding me.

726
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,940
I really don't know anyone here.

727
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
Do as you wish.

728
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
Fahbaz.

729
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
I have something to tell you.

730
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,940
I want to ask you to be my son,

731
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:29,940
Asawa Theowatin.

732
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,940
I want you to be my personal guard

733
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:34,940
for me.

734
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,940
I want you to be my personal guard

735
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,940
from now on.

736
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,940
I agree with you.

737
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,940
I want you to be my personal guard

738
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,940
for me.

739
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
I'm at your service.

740
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,940
That's good.

741
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,940
Fahbaz.

742
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,940
I'm leaving.

743
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,140
Right.

744
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,940
I want to talk to you two.

745
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,540
Can you give me some time?

746
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,420
I'm not used to this life.

747
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,140
Go.

748
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,220
Why did he do that?

749
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,000
It's convenient for us.

750
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,900
First of all,

751
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,500
Resignation is the emphasis to the right track.

752
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,940
Look for the ideal sort of backup

753
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,880
and leave it as it is

754
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,480
to the people in need.

755
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,480
That's impossible.

756
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,060
You told me to do that before calling troops.

757
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,060
Do you think I will be able to do it?

758
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,660
No.

759
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,660
I will say it like this.

760
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,140
I will order you to be my son.

761
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,980
You can talk to me as usual.

762
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:30,340
I hope you won't dare to disobey my order.

763
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,820
Right?

764
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,860
And another thing.

765
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,540
I am here to find out about my father.

766
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,460
You have to help me.

767
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,140
I think you will remember it.

768
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,900
Attorney Voice

769
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:15,360
Is there someone

770
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,120
in the battle?

771
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,480
The life of the Emperor

772
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,200
is as good as the life of the Emperor.

773
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,800
Don't be too confident.

774
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,400
He just wants everyone to believe

775
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,200
what the Emperor said.

776
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,560
Then

777
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
the God of Deity

778
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,520
will come back as the Emperor again.

779
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,640
Today, we have an important announcement

780
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,280
from the King's palace.

781
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,840
In the next three months,

782
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,440
there will be a competition

783
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,720
between the King and the Queen

784
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,520
to determine the position of the new Emperor.

785
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,200
The name of the contestant is

786
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,440
Mr. Ramin from the Puchong Pishut clan.

787
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,320
And to show the equality of men and women,

788
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,160
this year,

789
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,560
Ms. Eva from the Tawit Mettah clan

790
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,800
will compete in the important competition

791
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,880
of the King and the Queen.

792
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,280
Another topic that is talked about

793
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,280
a lot in this period

794
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,880
is the news about the heir

795
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,720
of the King of Deity.

796
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,560
There is also a news about this.

797
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,040
The King of Deity

798
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,640
will send the King of Deity

799
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,240
to the Royal Palace

800
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,600
to take the throne of the Emperor.

801
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,840
Now, the King's palace

802
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,280
is preparing to open the opening ceremony

803
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,640
of the King of Deity

804
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,080
to welcome and encourage the King of Deity.

805
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,000
I heard that the King of Deity

806
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,360
is a real heir.

807
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,040
And the King's palace

808
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,440
has already done DNA testing.

809
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,520
Are you looking for one already?

810
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,340
The order at the inner palace

811
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,220
is to select six

812
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,480
or eight ladies

813
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,380
to bring to the niewaifu palace.

814
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,240
It says that

815
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,880
the third or the infinity

816
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,760
two windows of heaven

817
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,720
are in front of the Quando building.

818
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,040
Isn't that true?

819
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
I know.

820
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,200
Everyone in the dance competition

821
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,640
has to keep changing their dance moves.

822
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,160
This is the most important thing

823
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,560
that you need to know.

824
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,560
Please teach me.

825
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,360
First of all,

826
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,240
I think it's better to say,

827
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,240
teach me.

828
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,440
And you don't have to say,

829
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,120
yes.

830
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,520
Okay.

831
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,400
Please teach me.

832
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,040
Okay?

833
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Okay?

834
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:27,920
What are you doing?

835
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,480
Nothing.

836
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,480
Don't be shy.

837
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,440
Just...

838
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,160
Just relax.

839
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,640
Okay.

840
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,280
Please float up.

841
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,360
Don't!!

842
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,040
Don't!!

843
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,640
Draw your own little boat.

844
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,720
You want to boat or go far away.

845
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,480
Stay right there.

846
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,240
Coward!

847
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,720
Coward!

848
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
Coward.

849
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,080
Coward!

850
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,240
Coward!

851
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,920
Coward!

852
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,960
I'm going to get 1000 Barracks showed!

853
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,040
Full moon!

854
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,360
Kingda!

855
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,360
Left.

856
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,360
And, twist.

857
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,360
And then, step back.

858
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,360
Step back.

859
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,360
Left. Step back.

860
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,360
And, twist.

861
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,360
Now, the bow will slowly turn.

862
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,360
Step back.

863
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,360
And, twist.

864
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,360
And then, start from the beginning.

865
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,360
And, stand up.

866
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,360
And, bow.

867
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
You didn't prank me, did you?

868
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,360
No, I didn't.

869
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
It's just a little mistake.

870
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,360
Emily, we stand in unity.

871
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:37,360
We stand so tall and our land stays free.

872
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:43,360
Through the storm, through the fight, we stand so strong.

873
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:48,360
We give our all for Emily.

874
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,360
Emily, people all belong.

875
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,360
Emily, we are proud to sing this noble song.

876
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,360
Our flag shall wave so high, so strong.

877
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,360
Emily's liberty for ever long.

878
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:15,360
Our flag shall wave so high, so strong.

879
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:22,360
Emily's liberty for ever long.

880
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,360
Applause.

881
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,360
Thank you.

882
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:29,360
Thank you all for joining us today.

883
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,360
The search for Mr. Kanin,

884
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,360
the only descendant of the Asuwa Deva,

885
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,360
our real nephew,

886
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,360
is a very extraordinary story.

887
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,360
And this is our nephew,

888
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,360
Kanin Asuwa Deva.

889
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,360
Let's go.

890
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,360
Let's go.

891
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,360
Let's go.

892
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Applause.

893
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,360
The sky is so bright.

894
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
I can't believe it.

895
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,360
But the care we have is not good enough.

896
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,360
I don't think of anything else but you.

897
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,360
But we are friends, right?

898
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,360
Can you promise me that if you know anything,

899
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,360
you will not do anything dangerous?

900
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
What do you know?

901
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,360
I think we should investigate this first.

902
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,360
I want to prove it.

903
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,360
I always remember that

904
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,360
if you are the competitor of Laos,

905
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,360
I will not give up.

906
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,360
I trust you.

907
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,360
I trust you.

908
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,360
I trust you.

909
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,360
I trust you.

910
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,360
I trust you.

911
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,360
The only thing I want to ask you is

912
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:17,360
how can I not leave you?

913
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,360
I will take you to the end of the world.
