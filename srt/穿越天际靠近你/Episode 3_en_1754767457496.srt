and for entertainment purposes only;

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,720
Khanin,

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,160
- go!
- Dad!

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,880
Now that the secret about you
is no longer safe from the enemy,

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,520
- This way!
- our journey to Emmaly won't be easy.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Khanin is almost here.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,480
I shall hold
the Royal Fencing Competition.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,640
You do know

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,280
how dangerous it is
to deal with power struggles

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,880
before the Competition.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I am unwell.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,720
I'm willing to take the risk
to bring my grandson back

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,520
because I trust no one
to protect Emmaly better than you.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,920
For Emmaly,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,160
Khanin must be the next prince.

17
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,200
Your Royal Highness...

18
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
What?

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
This is Chakri,

20
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
your butler.

21
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

22
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,000
I am the royal butler

23
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,920
assigned to serve Your Royal Highness.

24
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,800
Should you require anything,

25
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
please inform me at once.

26
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,000
Well...

27
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,320
There's no need for formality with me.

28
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
I wouldn't dare,

29
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,450
but you don't need to
speak so formally with me.

30
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,640
- But I...
- Your Royal Highness,

31
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,290
please let him fulfill his duties.

32
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,640
This way, Your Royal Highness.

33
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,240
Allow me to guide you
to the royal dressing room

34
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,720
to prepare for the audience
with His Majesty the King.

35
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Are you not coming?

36
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm afraid that wouldn't be appropriate.

37
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Why not?

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Well...

39
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,280
Please follow me this way,

40
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Royal Highness.

41
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,360
Your Royal Highness...

42
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,800
Young Prince.

43
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Young Prince...

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Who are you talking about?

45
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,700
Oh...

46
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,240
You are "Prince Khanin,"

47
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,390
and "Young Prince Master"

48
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,480
is another title
by which you're addressed.

49
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Hi.

50
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Uh...

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,159
Hello.

52
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Your Royal Highness...

53
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,520
Please don't do that.

54
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,040
Get up, please.

55
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,220
We can't handle it.

56
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
Please do not bow down.

57
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
You can't handle what?

58
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
The first thing you're gonna learn:

59
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,080
royal members
never lower their heads to anyone.

60
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,680
Wait...

61
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Is that the flag of Emmaly?

62
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,800
That's correct.

63
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,600
And the four flags
that you see right now

64
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,470
are the flags of each region of Emmaly.

65
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,040
That is the flag of Assavadevathin,

66
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,440
featuring a golden horse
on a golden background,

67
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
with crossed swords behind.

68
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,200
Assavadevathin is located
in the north of Emmaly.

69
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,440
Next is the flag of Bhuchongpisut,

70
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,560
displaying a king cobra
spreading its hood,

71
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,580
adorned with diamonds,

72
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,960
set on a green background,

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,760
surrounded by roses.

74
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
Bhuchongpisut lies
to the east of Emmaly.

75
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,080
The flag of Meenanagarin

76
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,180
shows a blue shark

77
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,250
with waves and pearls

78
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,480
on a blue background.

79
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,040
Meenanagarin is located
in the southern part of Emmaly,

80
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
near the sea.

81
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,130
Lastly,

82
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,800
the flag of Davichmetha

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,320
features a phoenix spreading its wings

84
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
adorned with gems,

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,000
set on a pink background.

86
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Davichmetha lies in the west of Emmaly.

87
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Mm.

88
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,560
Should you desire to know anything,

89
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,060
I am always here to answer.

90
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,500
There's nothing I don't know.

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Mr. Chakri,

92
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
no need to be so formal with me.

93
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm here for my dad,

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,640
not to be a prince.

95
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,120
Uh...

96
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I...

97
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,800
How are things going?

98
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Your Majesty, I humbly present myself.

99
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,400
I have brought the Earl Grey tea safely.

100
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,440
But something happened along the way,

101
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,720
and Mr. Thatdanai's whereabouts
are currently unknown.

102
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,559
How is Khanin?

103
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,919
Is he hurt anywhere?

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,840
His Royal Highness is safe,
Your Majesty.

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
And you? Did you get hurt?

106
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

107
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I am unharmed.

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,680
My only concern is for Mr. Thatdanai.

109
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
I don't know what's become of him.

110
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,680
You don't need to be concerned.

111
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Go find out
if Thatdanai is still alive or not,

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
and report back to me immediately.

113
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,160
As for the attackers,

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,400
very few know about Khanin's return.

115
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,560
One of them
is a police officer of Emmaly.

116
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm convinced it was an inside job.

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
If that's so,

118
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
immediately find out
who the mole inside this palace is.

119
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
Leave Khanin's protection to me.

120
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,540
I'll find someone to take your place.

121
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
You should hurry.

122
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,960
Right,

123
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,440
this is a projector developed
within our own nation of Emmaly.

124
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,100
It's a cutting-edge technology

125
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,940
used across all our cities.

126
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
Yet, for all our progress,

127
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,600
we continue to preserve
our noble traditions.

128
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,400
This is your royal dressing room,
Your Royal Highness.

129
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,540
May I inquire

130
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,510
if there's anything

131
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,780
that you favor, Your Royal Highness?

132
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,920
Do I need to wear those?

133
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,490
Attire within the palace

134
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,200
must adhere to royal protocol.

135
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
On formal occasions or royal ceremonies,

136
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
one must dress in accordance
with their rank and title.

137
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
So something formal's happening today?

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,540
Correct, Your Royal Highness.

139
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,880
Soon, you must present yourself
to the King,

140
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,320
who is your grandfather,

141
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,720
as well as to the major clans of Emmaly.

142
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,720
Your sense of fashion is amazing.

143
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Can I have something simpler?

144
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
Simpler?

145
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
Simpler...

146
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,120
Something simpler...

147
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,760
How about this one?

148
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,770
Decorated with gold threads.

149
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,940
You just need to add your rank insignia.

150
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,960
That's all, Your Royal Highness.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Something simpler.

152
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,800
That's not simpler at all.

153
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
You don't have anything simpler?

154
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Since you are meeting
with His Majesty the King,

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,560
please wear this.

156
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
What?

157
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,120
What are you gonna do?

158
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I can do it myself.

159
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

160
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,200
Please forgive me,

161
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,170
but...

162
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,760
Hey.

164
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,200
- No!
- I'll help you, Your Royal Highness.

165
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
- Now.
- You don't need to! I can do it myself.

166
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,520
Hey!

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,480
I'm gonna do it myself.

168
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
Come on, I can do it.

169
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
Let us help, Your Royal Highness.

170
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,240
- Ouch!
- Please let us.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Isn't it too tight?

172
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,280
What?

173
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,880
There's more?

174
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
We're almost done.

175
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,160
You only need some accessories

176
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,520
and...

177
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,520
a proper hairstyle.

178
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
Aw.

179
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm like a walking gold bar.

180
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,290
Aw,

181
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
a walking gold bar?

182
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,040
You're funny, Your Royal Highness.

183
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,600
I have some exciting news
to share with you.

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,280
What is it, Your Majesty?

185
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Hello.

186
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I am...

187
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Khanin Assavadevathin.

188
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,240
That is your father.

189
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,480
Have a seat.

190
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Please allow me to interrupt.

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,560
It's wonderful that Khanin is alive.

192
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,280
On behalf of the Meenanagarins,

193
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
I offer my sincere congratulations
to Your Majesty and Prince Tharin

194
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
for finding the heir.

195
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,040
We, the Davichmethas,
offer our congratulations as well.

196
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
We, the Bhuchongpisuts,

197
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,880
offer ours, too.

198
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,920
I appreciate that.

199
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,950
It's wonderful news,

200
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,240
and I am deeply glad.

201
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,680
I mean no disrespect in raising this
on a day of celebration,

202
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,550
but how do we know for sure
that this person

203
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,079
is Khanin

204
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,280
and is truly of
the Assavadevathin bloodline?

205
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,160
Should a DNA test
be conducted first, Your Majesty?

206
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Check this.

207
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,460
This is Prince Rachata,

208
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,280
the head of the Bhuchongpisut clan

209
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,680
and the ruler of the eastern region,

210
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
which is rich in diamonds.

211
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
He has a single heir, his son,

212
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,160
Prince Ramil.

213
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,440
You need not worry, Prince Rachata.

214
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,040
The test has been conducted,

215
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,880
and the results are with me.

216
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
Your Majesty,

217
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,920
how can I trust that they are authentic

218
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
and not fabricated?

219
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,640
Prince Rachata,
if you still have doubts,

220
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,570
you sure could arrange for another test

221
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,220
since the Bhuchongpisuts
are knowledgeable in the medical field.

222
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
Am I correct?

223
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

224
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,520
Please allow me.

225
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,560
This is Prince Chana,

226
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,960
the head of the Davichmetha clan

227
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,000
and ruler of the western region,

228
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,840
which is wealthy and rich in gemstones.

229
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,680
His sole heir is his daughter,

230
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Princess Ava.

231
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,580
Is there anyone else
who still has doubts?

232
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,120
If no further concerns remain,

233
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,210
I shall arrange a celebration

234
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,680
to welcome Khanin Assavadevathin,

235
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,120
my grandson.

236
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,320
You are all welcome to attend.

237
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,440
This meeting is hereby concluded.

238
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,970
This is Prince Wasin,

239
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
the head of the Meenanagarin clan

240
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,240
and the ruler of the southern region,

241
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,000
which is prosperous in pearls.

242
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,880
He lost his consort

243
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,880
and has no heirs.

244
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,160
Khanin.

245
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,440
Let's go.

246
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
It brings me great joy
to see our family gathered for a meal.

247
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,520
I've waited 22 years for this moment.

248
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,390
Thank you for coming back to me.

249
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,920
I'm happy, too,
that you're back with us.

250
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,520
Is the food to your liking?

251
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,400
Let me know
if there's anything you'd like,

252
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
and I'll have the cooks
prepare it for you.

253
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
Prince Tharin,

254
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,920
your father,

255
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,600
is the son of His Majesty the King.

256
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
He's the head of the Assavadevathin clan

257
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,360
and the ruler of the northern region,

258
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,080
which is rich in gold.

259
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Prince Tharin

260
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,960
lost his consort

261
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,280
and has one son,

262
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,040
Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

263
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,200
I...

264
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
I'm not picky.

265
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Everything looks so amazing.

266
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,000
Emmaly this, Emmaly that.

267
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,400
This food is Emmalian.

268
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
The house looks like
it came straight out of Emmaly.

269
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
Why didn't you
just name me Emmaly, too?

270
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Is spaghetti your favorite food?

271
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,640
My dad wanted me
to get used to Emmalian food,

272
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,540
so he cooked this for me quite a lot.

273
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,720
Uh...

274
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,520
I'm talking about...

275
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
my dad, Thatdanai.

276
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,520
You must have trained in fencing
while you were with Thatdanai.

277
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,540
And I assume you also know

278
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,200
that our country...

279
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,080
has the finest fencers.

280
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I've practiced it with my dad every day.

281
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,680
Thatdanai is a great fencer

282
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,400
and was once a coach for Tharin.

283
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,080
He later requested...

284
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,290
to be your fencing coach

285
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,330
even when you weren't born yet.

286
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
While you were in the UK,
did he teach you any skills

287
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,280
for the Competition?

288
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,160
The Competition?

289
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,280
Right.

290
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
You're a prince

291
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
and my grandson,

292
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,760
the rightful heir who's eligible

293
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,680
to compete
in the Royal Fencing Competition

294
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
to bring the throne to your father.

295
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,640
Actually, I came here

296
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,760
only to see Thatdanai, my dad.

297
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
I...

298
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,120
do not wish to take on the heir title

299
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,480
and will not compete
in this competition.

300
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,720
Please inform everyone of my decision.

301
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
I understand.

302
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,880
We can talk about the competition later.

303
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
As for your title,

304
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,160
whether you take it or not,

305
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,840
you're still my grandson.

306
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,200
I'm going out to the balcony.

307
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,520
Please don't follow me.

308
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,440
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

309
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Father.

310
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,280
Uh...

311
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
Did I address you correctly?

312
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,080
There's no need for formality.

313
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,810
I'm sorry...

314
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,560
for not joining the Competition.

315
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,840
I know your reasons,

316
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,520
and I never meant to push you.

317
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,840
Take your time adjusting.

318
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,370
If you're feeling uncomfortable,

319
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,840
or if you need anything,

320
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
don't hesitate to tell me.

321
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,280
I may not live in Davin,

322
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,560
but Assavadevathin is never far.

323
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,800
Can I ask you one more thing?

324
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Sure.

325
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,960
Other than coming here
to wait for Thatdanai, my dad,

326
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,030
I came because I want to know

327
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,120
who attacked us.

328
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well...

329
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,870
About that,

330
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,080
I'll do my part
to help uncover the truth.

331
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Khanin,

332
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,160
you must have been through a lot.

333
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
From now on,

334
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,680
would you let me protect you?

335
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,040
Uh...

336
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
I...

337
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,720
Well...

338
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
I appreciate that.

339
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
It's already late.

340
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,600
I won't bother you any further.

341
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,080
I'll take my leave now.

342
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,840
Could it be that His Majesty the King

343
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,200
purposely kept
Khanin's survival a secret

344
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,080
since the assassination
of Princess Khunita?

345
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Well...

346
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,520
He kept it a secret to protect Khanin.

347
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,880
I think it was a wise decision.

348
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,040
Now that Khanin has returned to Emmaly,

349
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,280
it is truly wonderful news.

350
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,540
With the return
of the Assavadevathin heir,

351
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,600
His Majesty will likely host
the Royal Fencing Competition soon.

352
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,310
That's uncertain.

353
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,640
Who really knows
what His Majesty has in mind?

354
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,440
The competition is pointless

355
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
when bringing that boy back

356
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,640
already hints that...

357
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,440
the Assavadevathins...

358
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,200
aim to maintain their reign.

359
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Perhaps you're reading
too much into this.

360
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,240
So far, nothing has actually occurred.

361
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,120
I was informed that

362
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,960
Mr. Thatdanai's house in the UK
was burned to the ground.

363
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
A body, charred beyond recognition,

364
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
was found inside.

365
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,040
The parts of the body
have been sent for testing

366
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,320
to confirm whether it is Mr. Thatdanai.

367
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Once the results are in,

368
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,200
I will report to you
immediately, Your Majesty.

369
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,850
No need to do that.

370
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
That body is Thatdanai's.

371
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,360
If Khanin can't let go of his past

372
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,160
and continues to dwell on it,

373
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
how can he possibly grow strong here?

374
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Deliver the sad news
about Thatdanai to him.

375
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Trust me,

376
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,280
and everything's gonna be alright.

377
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,280
What did you just say?

378
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,360
Answer me.

379
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,720
Tell me that again.

380
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,480
What did you just say?

381
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,000
Speak.

382
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,920
Come on.

383
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,000
Thatdanai has passed away,
Your Royal Highness.

384
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,000
No, that's not true.

385
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,870
No!

386
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,080
- I don't believe that.
- That's enough.

387
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,280
- That can't be real.
- Khanin.

388
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,410
Tell me that wasn't true!

389
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,570
Don't cry. I'm right here.

390
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,020
Khanin...

391
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Don't cry.

392
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,630
At a time like this,

393
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
you should not be alone.

394
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
You should let Chakri keep you company.

395
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,000
I want to be alone.

396
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,560
You can keep me company, then.

397
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,360
I have come to bid farewell.

398
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,440
I have completed my duty

399
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,080
of bringing you back safely,
Your Royal Highness.

400
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,080
I don't think this...

401
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,400
is appropriate, Your Royal Highness.

402
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
What do you mean?

403
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
We've shared a bed together for nights.

404
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,560
How come it's inappropriate now?

405
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,040
And I need to talk to you.

406
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,120
If I don't participate
in the Royal Competition,

407
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,680
will I be considered a traitor
to my family?

408
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,800
Everything...

409
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,600
rests upon your decision.

410
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Whatever you choose,

411
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,160
you have everyone's respect.

412
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
And you?

413
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,160
Do you want me to participate?

414
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,440
I do, Your Royal Highness.

415
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Well then,

416
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,360
will you respect the choice I'll make?

417
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,240
I may not have many choices,

418
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,840
but whatever I choose,

419
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,560
can you be by my side forever?

420
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,160
Don't leave me.

421
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,400
I have an important announcement to make.

422
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,880
Three months from now,

423
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,080
the Royal Competition will be held

424
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
to appoint a new king

425
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,560
to ascend to the throne.

426
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,200
You may speak.

427
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,240
Why must the Royal Competition be held

428
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,640
when the heir of the Bhuchongpisuts
stands as the sole rightful participant,

429
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,120
and the heir of the Assavadevathins
clearly has no desire to participate?

430
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,400
What are your thoughts

431
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,250
now that you've heard
what Prince Rachata has stated?

432
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,400
You're making me dizzy looking at you
pacing to and fro, Your Royal Highness.

433
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,400
I will find out who killed my dad.

434
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,160
And you? Do you want me to participate?

435
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,280
I do, Your Royal Highness.

436
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,200
Khanin!

437
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,560
- Run away.
- Dad!

438
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,600
In every age,

439
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,560
power remains with those who win.

440
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,000
I am taking part
in the Royal Competition.

441
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,490
The Assavadevathins
will also participate.

442
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,640
You hold no right to participate

443
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,320
as you have not been
officially appointed.

444
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,920
Regarding his heir title,

445
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,890
I shall hold a ceremony soon
to ensure Khanin is the heir,

446
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,180
granting him
the rightful place to compete

447
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,470
in the Royal Fencing Competition.

448
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,290
Does anyone oppose this decision?

449
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,540
It is thus decreed that

450
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,530
both an Assavadevathin
and a Bhuchongpisut

451
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,650
shall partake in the Royal Competition.

452
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Why don't I have the right,
Your Majesty?

453
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,320
But no woman
has ever participated before.

454
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,680
We have adhered to this tradition
for generations.

455
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,560
You must understand that women
do not have the same rights as men.

456
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,040
I will participate
in the Royal Competition.

457
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,240
The rules don't state that
women are forbidden from competing.

458
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,440
It's just what everyone believes.
That's all.

459
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,020
The rules only say

460
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,580
that competitors must prove their worth.

461
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,280
Based on that,

462
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,640
I have every right to prove myself.

463
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,240
I agree with her, Your Majesty.

464
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,880
These days,
men and women stand as equals.

465
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,240
Gender makes no difference.

466
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
It's skill that truly matters.

467
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,920
Upon reflection,

468
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,520
I see that what Ava said

469
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
is true.

470
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,360
Therefore, I hereby declare that

471
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
the heir of the Davichmetha clan

472
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,760
may participate in the Competition.

473
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
A Bhuchongpisut,

474
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,280
a Davichmetha,

475
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,160
and an Assavadevathin

476
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,600
shall partake in the Royal Competition.

477
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,660
May each of you sharpen your abilities.

478
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,440
This concludes the meeting.

479
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,200
While one vanished

480
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,560
and returned miraculously,

481
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,630
the other...

482
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
is a woman.

483
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,000
By the customs of old,

484
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,400
you wouldn't be allowed to compete.

485
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,720
Fate truly favors
both of you, Brother and Sister.

486
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,760
Khanin...

487
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
and Ava...

488
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,960
With both of you
joining the Competition,

489
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,720
it should be quite exciting.

490
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,600
Make sure you train hard, Brother.

491
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,880
Thank you for your concern,
Brother Ramil.

492
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,120
Thank you for today.

493
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,720
Forgive my boldness, Your Majesty,

494
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,400
but may I ask that...

495
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,760
were you not at all concerned

496
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,080
when Prince Rachata
raised his objections?

497
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,920
Nothing is beyond my control.

498
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,840
Checkmate.

499
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,510
Has anyone seen Mr. Charan?

500
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,080
I think he is
at the University of the Arts.

501
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,750
Why would he be there?

502
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Is he still a student?

503
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,420
A professor.

504
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,950
He's a professor, Your Royal Highness.

505
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,860
Mr. Charan's probably back
at the university teaching art by now.

506
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,860
Teaching art?

507
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,930
Actually,

508
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,820
he is exceptionally talented in art.

509
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,380
More importantly,

510
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,300
he is a professor
at Morpheus University of the Arts,

511
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,220
which belongs to the Phithakthewa clan.

512
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,620
Morpheus?

513
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,760
Morpheus.

514
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Interesting.

515
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,140
Thought he was only good at fighting.

516
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,060
Turns out
he's got an artistic side, too.

517
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,740
Cat got your tongue?

518
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,340
Got this while we were attacked
in the UK.

519
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,420
Why wait until now?

520
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,660
Is it fake?

521
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,900
I've checked. It's not.

522
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:55,140
Why would he leave evidence behind?

523
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,860
Cause he doesn't care.

524
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,700
Okay. I've got this.

525
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,360
That's all?

526
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,900
You wanted me back here just for this?

527
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,680
One more thing.

528
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,960
Can you help me find someone?

529
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,380
Who is it?

530
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,660
Someone from the UK.

531
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,120
His whereabouts are unknown.

532
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,940
It's been staged
to look like he was killed.

533
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,660
You mean,

534
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,180
he's alive,

535
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,920
and you don't know where he is?

536
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,080
Right.

537
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,360
You could try explaining it
more simply, you know.

538
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,240
Fine.

539
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
Basically,

540
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,760
I want you to find Thatdanai,

541
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,100
the soldier who looked after
Prince Khanin back in the UK.

542
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,520
But this...

543
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,840
has to stay strictly confidential.

544
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,240
Hey...

545
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,880
Your Royal Highness...

546
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,640
Here we go again.

547
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,600
You're gonna ask
how I got here, aren't you?

548
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,160
I came to look for
Mr. Charan Phithakthewa.

549
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,920
We need to find Prince Khanin.

550
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,160
This could put our news on the map.

551
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,680
- Hold on.
- What?

552
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,920
How can you be sure he's here?

553
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,360
You sure it's true?

554
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,960
- Trust me.
- My apologies.

555
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,080
I knew it from my insider.
It's the real deal.

556
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,960
Your insider's always wrong.

557
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,360
No, this one's not.

558
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,070
I saw someone from the palace.

559
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
Whoa.

560
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,960
I'll use the toilet.

561
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,080
Don't be long.

562
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,280
My apologies.

563
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
Why would you apologize?

564
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,800
We didn't kiss.

565
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,200
Take the bike and meet me at the exit.

566
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah, right now.

567
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,600
Your Royal Highness!

568
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,680
I think...

569
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,160
we must return to the palace now.

570
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,920
Someone recognized me.

571
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,320
Keep them busy.

572
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,280
I'll take His Royal Highness
to the palace.

573
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,920
Understood.

574
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
Come with me, Your Royal Highness.

575
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,320
I'll take my leave, Your Royal Highness.

576
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
Where are you going?

577
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,280
Stay the night here.

578
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,920
Why?

579
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,240
You can't do that now?

580
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,120
You're really leaving me, aren't you?

581
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,960
I apologize.

582
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,760
My duties are completed.

583
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Stop right there.

584
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,080
You're not allowed to leave.

585
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,880
Hey!

586
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,680
Thank you, Grandfather,
for understanding me.

587
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,480
I barely know anyone here.

588
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,080
Oh...

589
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
Feel free.

590
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,800
Your Majesty...

591
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,400
Charan, I need you to do me a favor.

592
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,160
I, Prince Khanin Assavadevathin,

593
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,820
command you, Charan, to be by my side

594
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,600
and be my royal guard from now on.

595
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,000
I support this.

596
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,850
It's best to let Charan return
to being Khanin's personal guard

597
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,160
as he was before.

598
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,040
Your command is my will, Your Majesty.

599
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,000
Good.

600
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,680
I'd like to speak with Charan privately.

601
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,600
May I have a moment alone with him?

602
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,200
Gosh,

603
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,630
this way of living
feels so strange to me.

604
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,440
Is there something bothering you?

605
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,920
Your Royal Highness,

606
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,040
I don't think
I should speak informally to you

607
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,420
due to our different statuses.

608
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,760
I will ensure to act appropriately
from now on,

609
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,480
and I hope you will also
carry yourself accordingly.

610
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,320
Nope.

611
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,080
I'm fine talking this way,

612
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,600
and as a prince, I command you

613
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,400
to speak to me informally.

614
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,910
You wouldn't dare
defy the order of a prince,

615
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,520
would you?

616
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
And by the way,

617
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,040
I'm still here
only to find the truth about my dad,

618
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,000
and you need to help me.

619
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,760
I assume you remember that, right?

620
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,320
Has the message from His Majesty
reached you all?

621
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,800
He's appointed Charan as Khanin's guard.

622
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,880
But honestly,
can Charan really handle that role?

623
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,280
His Majesty adopted him,

624
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,920
but he was never trained

625
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,320
or even wielded a weapon.

626
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,360
All he did was grow up
to become an art professor.

627
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,440
Does someone like that
really know how to fight?

628
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,560
His Majesty is a vicious old man.

629
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,200
Do not let your guard down.

630
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,600
He just wants everyone
to believe it that way.

631
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,210
And just like that,

632
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,080
the Phithakthewas

633
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,760
shall reclaim their position
as royal guards once more.

634
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,120
[Royal heirs to compete in Royal Competition
for their father's throne]

635
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,680
Today, the Royal Palace has issued
a major announcement.

636
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,270
In three months,

637
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,120
the Royal Competition will be held

638
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,960
to determine the next king.

639
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,320
The list of competitors is as follows:

640
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,760
Prince Ramil of the Bhuchongpisut clan.

641
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,720
To promote gender equality,

642
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,000
Princess Ava of the Davichmetha clan

643
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,880
will also take part
in this year's prestigious competition.

644
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,620
Another topic
that has been widely discussed recently

645
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,160
concerns the heir
of the Assavadevathin clan.

646
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,800
A breaking announcement confirms

647
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,040
that Prince Khanin Assavadevathin

648
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,880
will be entering the Royal Competition
for the throne.

649
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,300
The Palace is also preparing

650
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,920
a formal introduction ceremony
for Prince Khanin Assavadevathin

651
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,520
to welcome and encourage him.

652
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,120
I heard that Prince Khanin

653
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,720
is actually the real heir,

654
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,760
and the Royal Palace
already ran a DNA test to confirm it.

655
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,980
Yesterday's announcement
from the Royal Palace

656
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,720
drew a lot of attention,
Your Royal Highness.

657
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,200
Everyone wants to know more about you.

658
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,160
My outfit was that striking.

659
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,480
I'd be surprised
if I didn't get noticed.

660
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,740
Feel free, Your Royal Highness.

661
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,200
If I could shine with a golden glow,
that'd be perfect.

662
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,280
Please don't make fun of yourself,
Your Royal Highness.

663
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,360
So...

664
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,920
We may start.

665
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,520
Back in the day,

666
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,420
the ancestors of Emmalians

667
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,320
were very fond of social gatherings

668
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,400
and dancing.

669
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,560
One of their long-standing traditions

670
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,360
is switching partners while they dance.

671
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Switching partners?

672
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,160
That's correct.

673
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,390
All attendees

674
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,720
would continuously change
dance partners.

675
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,370
It's a tradition

676
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,900
that you ought to be familiar with.

677
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,760
Please teach me how to do it.

678
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
First of all,

679
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,400
it'd be better if you said, "Teach me."

680
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,320
No need for the word "please."

681
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:16,840
Sure.

682
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,800
Teach me,

683
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,640
okay?

684
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,640
That's amazing.

685
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,440
What are you doing?

686
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,960
What? Did I get it wrong?

687
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:38,880
You don't need to move it like this.

688
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,640
Just place your hand on my palm,
Your Royal Highness.

689
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,040
We'll start from the footwork.

690
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,180
Step forward.

691
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,420
One, two, three.

692
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,760
- Ouch.
- Oh.

693
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,320
I'm okay, Your Royal Highness.

694
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Mistakes are common.

695
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,120
Left,

696
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,560
and close.

697
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,480
Now step backward.

698
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,400
Backward.

699
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,960
- Right...
- Backward...

700
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,500
- And close.
- Close.

701
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:31,040
Now, we'll slowly spin.

702
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,490
Back.

703
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,640
Spin.

704
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,160
Spin now.

705
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,400
Right, spin.

706
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,280
Seems like I'm starting to pick it up.

707
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,120
During your official introduction,

708
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,600
a lot of media outlets
will be covering the event

709
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,200
and showing great interest
in Your Royal Highness.

710
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,560
That day,

711
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,960
news about you
is going to be all over social media.

712
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,320
If the public response is positive,

713
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,360
you will be warmly embraced
by the people.

714
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,200
Thus, you should be ready,

715
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,640
especially in how you answer questions,

716
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,540
and present yourself appropriately

717
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,680
as Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

718
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:14,290
Argh!

719
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,480
Your Royal Highness...

720
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,200
You didn't do that on purpose, did you?

721
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,440
I didn't.

722
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,880
- It was a mistake.
- Oh...

01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,640
Thank you for joining me today.

735
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,880
To have finally found Khanin,

736
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,440
the only heir
of the Assavadevathin bloodline,

737
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,520
my grandson,

738
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,200
is a miracle beyond words.

739
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,220
This is my grandson,

740
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,520
Khanin Assavadevathin.

741
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,680
You mean more to me

742
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,440
than you could ever imagine.

743
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,080
But the care that goes beyond your duty

744
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,600
doesn't reflect well, Charan.

745
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,080
I have no other feelings or intentions.

746
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,600
But we're friends, too, aren't we?

747
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,120
May I ask you to promise

748
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,560
that if I tell you something,

749
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,960
you will not put yourself in danger?

750
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,200
What have you got?

751
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,200
I think...

752
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,840
we should look into this ourselves first.

753
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,160
I want to go to Bhuchongpisut.

754
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,680
Your Royal Highness, always remember

755
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,720
that Prince Ramil is your rival
in the Royal Competition.

756
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,680
I won't underestimate him.
