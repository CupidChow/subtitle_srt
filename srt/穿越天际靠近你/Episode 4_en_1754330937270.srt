1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and join the competition of this kingdom.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Asawatthewatin will compete too.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The son will compete in this kingdom.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the law, it is not prohibited or said that women are prohibited from competing.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It will be fun if there are two people competing.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Practice a lot, brother.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Nothing is beyond our control.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And this is our grandson.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Asawatthewatin.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Asawatthewatin.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Asawatthewatin.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Asawatthewatin.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please welcome Asawatthewatin.

14
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Prince Kuneo.

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nice to see you today.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is Ying-on.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She is from Thailand.

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
From Thailand.

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I like your look today.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So perfect and gorgeous and so…

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you Ying-on for being here today.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh my god. It's my pleasure.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Nice to see you.

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Excuse me.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Congratulations Prince Kuneo.

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bye. See you.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Thank you.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's my honor to be able to participate in your party.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's also my honor to be able to participate in your party.

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm very happy to meet you, Your Majesty.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm Kaning.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm Kaning.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm very happy to meet you.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Today Kaning plays the piano very gently.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I hope you enjoy today's party.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Good. Good.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm a representative of the Kingdom of Phuja.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I would like to express my congratulations to the King of Phuja.

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't have to do this.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We are friends and we are friends.

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm Kaning.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm Kaning.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm Kaning.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Soon we will have to ask the King of Phuja and Kaning

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because Kevin, our son, is very interested in the University of Arts.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I feel very honored.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm very honored to be able to participate in the party.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Prince Kaning is blessed with musical talent.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm very happy to be able to participate in the party.

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been interested in the instrument since I was young.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good evening.

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good night.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As a representative of the King of Phuja,

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm honored to be able to participate in this royal banquet.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I would like to congratulate you, Your Majesty, Prince Kaning.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We are very happy to have you here today.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In addition to his genius with music,

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
his skills with the violin are unbeatable.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We learned about the reputation of his Highness, the Prince, when he was in London.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The violin is a great part of my life.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was taught about it since I was a child

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
because the people of Mali are known for the best violin players.

67
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm very happy to be able to participate in this royal banquet.

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your Majesty, it's time for me to prepare the King for the dance party tonight.

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Thank you.

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Congratulations.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thank you.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Prince Kaning, it's a big job.

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Come on, Ying. Let's dance together.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's dance together.

76
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's dance together.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm just in a moonlight with you

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Under the stars just as blue

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
With every beat, my heart's complete to you

80
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You know my dreams come true

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm loving forever with you

82
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

84
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

87
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

88
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

89
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

90
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hold me so tight all through the night

91
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden Ruler, the King of the Golden

92
00:11:39,000 --> 00:12:03,240
all is possible thanks to the

93
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,840
Unexpectedly I knew that Acorn Jeff was a good guy.

94
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,440
Hey Acorn.

95
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,640
But then when Produce X 101 ended,

96
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,200
I thought that Acorn's hidden translated lyrics

97
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,760
was so crispy and sweet preparing my breath.

98
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
So, I also planned to go help someone.

99
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,920
Here.

100
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,840
Respectically.

101
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
I've got an appointment with somebody.

102
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Hatheyyach它来着

103
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,580
KhunMing

104
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,520
Everyone is staring at you

105
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,920
As if it's been practiced

106
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
from the north.

107
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Especially about Charan.

108
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
You don't have to answer.

109
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I understand.

110
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Chakri.

111
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Charan.

112
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I'll wait here.

113
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I'm sorry.

114
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Then, please come in.

115
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm not used to it.

116
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm here on behalf of Emily.

117
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm pleased to welcome you back.

118
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I'd like to ask you about your life

119
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
before you go back to Emily.

120
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I grew up in London.

121
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I never thought that

122
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I'd be in a place like this.

123
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm in a big palace

124
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
and I'm living a life I've never lived before.

125
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,920
I feel that I'm not used to this.

126
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,920
About the dance party,

127
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I saw that you're very close to Charan.

128
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Can you tell me about your closeness?

129
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I'm sorry.

130
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
I've already made a lot of arrangements.

131
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I have to go to work.

132
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Are you tired?

133
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Would you like to have some snacks or snacks?

134
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
That's good.

135
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Thank you, Chakri.

136
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
You helped me a lot today.

137
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Are you tired?

138
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
It's my duty.

139
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Aren't you tired?

140
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Come sit.

141
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Here.

142
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
Here.

143
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
What is your duty?

144
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,920
To protect and take care of the family.

145
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,920
To keep and protect the family.

146
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
That's my duty.

147
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
You two don't have to use the word,

148
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
but you can use the word,

149
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Your Majesty.

150
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Yes.

151
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Why didn't you go to the interview room with me today?

152
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Answer me.

153
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Why?

154
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Because when we danced,

155
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
many people looked at us.

156
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
So?

157
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
What is more important to you?

158
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Worrying about you.

159
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You said it like this.

160
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
You said you were worried about me.

161
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm worried.

162
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Worrying about you.

163
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Worrying about what?

164
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Yes.

165
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I know. I'll go see you.

166
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Hurry up.

167
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,920
The internet people will definitely be mad at you.

168
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Your Majesty.

169
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Your Majesty.

170
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Uncle Nin.

171
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Your Majesty.

172
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I forgot to take off the wireless.

173
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,920
I heard the close word of the couple.

174
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
It's like a play.

175
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
So this happened.

176
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
The king and the queen are very suitable.

177
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
What do you think about this?

178
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
I think it's impossible for the two of them to be together.

179
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,920
You are a smart person and feel good about yourself.

180
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Do you think it's just a call?

181
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
When there is a news group,

182
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
people are suspicious.

183
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
Actually, it's a good call.

184
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,920
But I don't know if it's really an act or a cause.

185
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
It's true.

186
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,920
You can still smile.

187
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Do you think this is a joke?

188
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
It's true.

189
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
According to the original rules,

190
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
it may not affect the competition of this kingdom.

191
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,920
But I don't think it's that bad.

192
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Your Majesty, you have to change something.

193
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
I don't want to change anything.

194
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,920
So you have to find a coach to train more.

195
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
But I don't think it's appropriate.

196
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Excuse me.

197
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Are you worried about me?

198
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I said I was worried.

199
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm worried.

200
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Worried?

201
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
In what position?

202
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Please check the condition of the two passengers.

203
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

204
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Sir.

205
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Why is it so bright?

206
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,920
It's because the royal court is trying to create a new trend.

207
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Come.

208
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Do you know why I called you here?

209
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,920
You want to ask about the news, right?

210
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,920
I understand that now you have equal rights.

211
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You are my nephew.

212
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
And that one is my nephew.

213
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
The relationship that is more than difficult

214
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
doesn't seem appropriate.

215
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I understand.

216
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,920
My nephew and Sirun are just close.

217
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,920
It's because he was the one who took my nephew.

218
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,920
We have been through death together.

219
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
It doesn't look good, Sirun.

220
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm sorry to say that I just take care of Sir Ka-nin

221
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
as a personal favorite of His Majesty.

222
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I don't have any other thoughts with Sir Ka-nin.

223
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
I'm just a real person, Your Majesty.

224
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,920
I don't have feelings for Sir Ka-nin.

225
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
This is the time to open up, Ka-nin.

226
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,920
After this, you have to be more careful.

227
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,920
And what about the news?

229
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I have a request to make, Your Majesty.

230
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:17,920
At this time, Sir Ka-nin has received a lot of support from the people.

231
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Would it be good if you could present yourself as a person who is easy to get along with and open up?

232
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I think it will make Sir Ka-nin the favorite of the people.

233
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,920
If His Majesty is in a hurry to fix the news now,

234
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,920
it will make the people wonder if it is a trick or a cover-up.

235
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Maybe it's not good for His Majesty's image.

236
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Smile.

237
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
Are you ready? Look at the camera and smile.

238
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
It's the end of the day.

239
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Sir Ka-nin, would you like to send me some water?

240
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,920
So I can feel comfortable.

241
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm fine.

242
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Okay.

243
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Let's go.

244
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Stop. Stop. Stop.

245
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
Stop. I can do it myself.

246
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
You must be tired today. Go to rest.

247
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
You mean the pillow?

248
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Yes.

249
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Who let you go?

250
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Fah-Barn.

251
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
We are alone now.

252
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Yes?

253
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,180
You said to the

254
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,300
the

255
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
that you take care of me as a private person.

256
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
That's my duty.

257
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,920
But we are friends, aren't we?

258
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
If you have nothing to say,

259
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
please rest.

260
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

261
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
Tomorrow morning, you have to go back to the country of Emily.

262
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Thanks.

263
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Good night.

264
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Go away.

265
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
Who does She know?

266
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
He looks like the person that user Emily does.

267
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,920
The four clans joined forces and got the throne.

268
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
The prince Thanae of the royal family

269
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
announced the arrival of King Phrapeniphan.

270
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
He wanted to take the throne from there.

271
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Where is the prince?

272
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
He went to the palace.

273
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
He went to the palace to see the prince.

274
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
He went to the palace to see the prince.

275
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
He went to the palace to see the prince.

276
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,920
He went to the palace to see the prince.

277
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
No.

278
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
No.

279
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,920
Never mind.

280
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Just continue. I'm listening.

281
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
What I'm waiting for

282
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
after the new king of the modern kingdom

283
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
is the new king of the new kingdom

284
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
who is the king of the new kingdom.

285
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
If your king Thanae is the winner

286
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
then the last of those clans

287
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
will be the next king.

288
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
When the time comes,

289
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
the angel will come back to take us back.

290
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
I promise.

291
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Before this,

292
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,920
the angel just wants you to be safe.

293
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Safe to compete.

294
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Actually, it's okay.

295
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
You and Chakri know

296
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,920
that we came back and agreed to compete

297
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
to find out about my father.

298
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
But we still don't know anything.

299
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Can you promise me

300
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
that if you know something,

301
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
you won't do anything dangerous?

302
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
What do you know?

303
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Promise me first.

304
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Promise?

305
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
I promise.

306
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
I want you to find out the evidence

307
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
that I got from the murderer when I was in England.

308
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
As you can see,

309
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
you are a real police officer.

310
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
You are the best.

311
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Come here.

312
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,920
This is the picture that the king used to use as a source of information.

313
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

314
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Apart from the police officer's record,

315
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
you are doing a very bad job.

316
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,920
But the person who did this is the real police officer.

317
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
It may be true or not.

318
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Have you told the police?

319
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll talk to you first.

320
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Don't tell them yet.

321
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,920
I think we should find out about this first.

322
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,920
And I want to go to the real police.

323
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,920
The DNA is 99% accurate.

324
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
The king has appeared.

325
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Kanin,

326
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
are you here to pick me up?

327
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Ramin and I are very happy that you visited our city.

328
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'm here to pick you up, Uncle Ramin.

329
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Kanin, I'm very happy

330
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
that you visited the city of Phuchong.

331
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,920
I'll let Ramin take you to see the city of Phuchong.

332
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Okay.

333
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I'll let Ramin take you to see our city.

334
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Let's be close like this so you don't have to worry about me.

335
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Thank you for your concern.

336
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
After seeing the city,

337
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I'll let Ramin take you to see the city of Phuchong.

338
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
There are records about Emily's history.

339
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
You can study it.

340
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
I'm sorry.

342
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,920
If you have any questions, you can always ask me.

343
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Because the city of Phuchong is the oldest city.

344
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
That's very interesting.

345
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
I have to thank you.

346
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Let's go.

347
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
The city of Phuchong

348
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Kanin, after I took you to see the city of Phuchong,

349
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
there is one more important place

350
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
that I want to take you to.

351
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
An important place

352
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
doesn't mean the city of Phuchong.

353
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Besides the city, there is another important place

354
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
that is not open to outsiders.

355
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
It's the city of Phuchong.

356
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
It's said to be the city of Phuchong.

357
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
If he's not involved,

358
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
shall we go there tonight?

359
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
I think

360
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Mr. Ramin may not know anything about the prince.

361
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Or maybe

362
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
he's not the real prince.

363
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I haven't told you anything yet.

364
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
But I think

365
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
don't trust him.

366
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm sorry.

367
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I'm sorry.

368
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
I'm sorry.

370
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I don't trust anyone except you.

371
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Are you really not going to let me follow you?

372
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
It's okay.

373
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't dare to do anything to inform you.

374
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I always remember

375
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,920
that you are the competitor in this competition.

376
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Don't miss the chance.

377
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I won't hesitate.

378
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
I'll call you if there's anything.

379
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
The place is so beautiful.

380
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Didn't the younger generation

381
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
allow you to enter?

382
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Sometimes,

383
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
it's not for everyone.

384
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
The younger brother may not know that his mother is here.

385
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
The princess, Ms. Nita,

386
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
is the daughter of the prince.

387
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Ms. Nita

388
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
is the youngest daughter in the royal family.

389
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Ms. Sak is the younger sister of my father.

390
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Actually, we are relatives.

391
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Please

392
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
let me give my brother a gift.

393
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Thank you.

394
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
Thank you, Mr. Ramminpay.

395
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
When I was young,

396
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
when I was upset,

397
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
I would come here alone.

398
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
But

399
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,920
it made me feel that I was small.

400
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
The pressure as a king

401
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
must have been very strong.

402
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
But

403
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
for you to be a water-singer like today,

404
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
please.

405
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
I'm sorry.

406
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
This is the royal painting.

407
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
It's a painting that our kingdom

408
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
has respected and worshiped for many generations.

409
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
You may feel familiar with it

410
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
because the most important thing in the royal family

411
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
is the model from this painting.

412
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm sorry.

413
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm sorry.

415
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
I'm sorry.

416
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
I'm sorry.

417
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm sorry.

418
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
Can you compare the profit

419
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
that I gave you to it?

420
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Huh?

421
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
What did my brother get?

422
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
The profit…

423
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Did he get it in this area?

424
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Perhaps…

425
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
When we receive something from someone,

426
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
we will keep it alive.

427
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
But it's okay.

428
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I will go outside to check.

429
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
The way we came, you can find it around here.

430
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Okay.

431
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,920
The way we came, you can find it around here.

432
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Mukanyokhe Salt Lake

433
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
The reward is high.

434
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

435
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Hurry up and join the Macau New Beijing Entertainment City, 891891.com.

436
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,920
Please help me prepare the food for the young master.

437
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,920
You can wait.

438
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Okay, Sir.

439
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
Thank you.

440
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
Thank you.

441
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Thank you.

442
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Thank you.

443
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Thank you.

444
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Thank you.

445
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Thank you.

446
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Thank you.

447
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Thank you.

448
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Thank you.

449
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,920
Thank you.

450
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
You can wait.

451
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Okay, Sir.

452
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Sir, why are you alone?

453
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,920
And Mr.Ramen and Mr.Kanin?

454
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Both of them went to the forest to play.

455
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
How long have they been gone?

456
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Four hours.

457
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,920
They must be back soon.

458
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Kanin, Kanin is missing.

459
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Her phone is out of reach.

460
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
Wait, Sir.

461
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
Why are you back so soon?

462
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
Don't you have to leave tomorrow?

463
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
But now is not the time.

464
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
We have to hurry up and find Mr.Kanin.

465
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Okay.

466
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,920
Sir Kanin.

467
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Sir Kanin.

468
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,920
Sir Kanin.

469
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,920
Sir Kanin.

470
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,920
Sir Kanin.

471
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Sir Kanin.

472
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
We are waiting for him here.

473
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,920
I'll go this way.

474
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
Sir Kanin.

475
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Sir Kanin.

476
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
You three come this way.

477
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,920
I'll follow you.

478
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
Okay.

479
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
Sir Kanin.

480
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
Sir Kanin.

481
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
You.

482
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
You, right? I'm here.

483
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
Are you okay?

484
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Yes.

485
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
The car crashed.

486
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,920
The bike is also broken.

487
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
So I'm waiting here.

488
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Do you have a wound or bruise?

489
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
The one that crashed just now.

490
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
I'm sorry.

491
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
I'm sorry.

492
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm sorry.

493
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
I'm sorry.

494
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
I'm sorry to make you worry.

495
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I'm sorry.

496
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
It's my fault.

497
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,920
How can it be your fault?

498
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
It's an accident.

499
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
No, it's not.

500
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,920
It's my fault.

501
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
If Sir Kanin has fallen into danger

502
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,920
without my ability to do anything,

503
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,920
my duty to protect him

504
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,920
is just a word.

505
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
But…

506
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
Fahbad.

507
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Fahbad is important to me.

508
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
More than you can imagine.

509
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
I'm sorry.

510
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I'm sorry.

511
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Sir.

512
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,920
Just clean the car.

513
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
You found this car?

514
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Let's go.

515
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
Sir Kanin.

516
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I'm sorry.

517
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
I went back to the cave.

518
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
I couldn't find him.

519
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,920
We might have met by accident.

520
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
And the profit.

521
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,920
I found it.

522
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
I'll return it to you.

523
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm sorry, Sir Kanin.

524
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
I'm sorry, Sir Kanin.

525
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
I'm sorry, Sir Kanin.

526
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
Sir Kanin.

527
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Are you okay?

528
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
I'm sorry.

529
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,920
I'm sorry.

530
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,920
I'm sorry for letting you

531
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
and Sir Ramin

532
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,920
into the forest

533
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,920
and following you.

534
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,920
Ramin,

535
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
are you sorry?

536
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
I'm asking you.

537
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,920
Are you sorry?

538
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Are you sorry?

539
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
Don't do this, Sir Kanin.

540
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
I'm not blaming you.

541
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
I think

542
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
it's not appropriate

543
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
for me to stay here tonight.

544
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
I'm sorry, Sir Kanin.

545
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,920
What are you doing?

546
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,920
You're stupid.

547
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
You don't have any idea.

548
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,920
You think I don't know

549
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,920
that you used that forest

550
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
as a signal

551
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,920
and the fire was gone

552
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,920
because of you, right?

553
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,920
No, Sir.

554
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
No?

555
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,920
No?

556
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Listen to me.

557
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
You can sleep

558
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
in the heaven

559
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,920
but don't do anything stupid

560
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,920
like that to Kanin.

561
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
And the reason why you're so stupid

562
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
is because

563
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,920
you're stupid.

564
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
I'm sorry.

565
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
I'm sorry.

566
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,920
I'm sorry.

567
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
I'm sorry.

568
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,920
I'm sorry.

569
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
I'm sorry.

570
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
Can I ask you a favor?

571
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Can I ask you a favor?

572
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
It's not your fault.

573
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,920
I'm the one who's to blame.

574
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
You just didn't make it to the game.

575
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
But I'm glad

576
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
that the one who found me the first is you.

577
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,920
I'm glad that I found you.

578
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,920
Thank you.

579
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
I think

580
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
that the two of them are not good

581
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
to the gods.

582
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,920
I feel strange.

583
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
But don't tell the god about

584
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
the person who was the police.

585
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
And I want to ask everyone

586
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,920
not to talk about this again.

587
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
I have nothing

588
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
that can be hidden from the eyes of the gods.

589
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,920
I can't live without you.

590
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
Sit down.

591
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Why did you come back before me?

592
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,920
You've traveled enough.

593
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
I know that there's no place

594
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,920
that's safe for you.

595
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Yes, sir.

596
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,920
Look at this picture.

597
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
What does it look like?

598
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
The two stars

599
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
are beautiful stars

600
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
in the sky.

601
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
It looks romantic.

602
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
I'm happy.

603
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
The two stars are

604
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
side by side.

605
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,920
But it's not easy.

606
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
According to the legend,

607
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
the star of Por Laks

608
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,920
is like the god of

609
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Buddha.

610
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
And the star of Custer

611
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
is like a normal human

612
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,920
with a human age.

613
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,920
They can't be together.

614
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,920
If Por Laks doesn't want to lose his natural ability,

615
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920
and if the story ends with death,

616
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,920
do you still think

617
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,920
that this story is still romantic?

618
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,920
I'm sorry, Phra Baan.

619
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,920
I have a feeling that

620
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,920
even though they're side by side

621
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
in the star of Custer,

622
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,920
it's still a legend

623
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
that shows an impressive love.

624
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
This restaurant is really suitable

625
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,920
for an artist.

626
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Thank you, sir.

627
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,920
I almost forgot.

628
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
The Garwin of Mujar

629
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
will continue to study

630
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,920
the art of the Faculty of Arts of Charan.

631
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
I don't see anyone

632
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,920
who can be more important than Charan.

633
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
I'm afraid

634
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
that I don't have time

635
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,920
to study the art of the King.

636
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
You can go back

637
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
and do what you love.

638
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
And Kaning,

639
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
Phu will take care of him.

640
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,920
So he can have more concentration.

641
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,920
I hope you understand.

642
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Yes, sir.

643
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,920
I think

644
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,920
what happened at the audience

645
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,920
is that

646
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
Kaning

647
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,920
shouldn't have asked Charan to tell him.

648
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Never mind.

649
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Nothing better than this.

650
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
Yes, sir.

651
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
Sometimes, if you can make Kaning

652
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
stay away from Charan,

653
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,920
it would be good.

654
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Thank you.

655
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,920
Here, Kawin.

656
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
An exchange student from Mujar.

657
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Please take care of him.

658
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,920
My pleasure.

659
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,920
What are you doing here?

660
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,920
Why aren't you with me?

661
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,920
My brain just follows the duty.

662
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
And the duty to protect and take care of you.

663
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
To keep and be loyal to the divine being that you used to say.

664
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,920
Come and sit here.

665
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
I think…

666
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
I told you to come and sit here.

667
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
Come and sit here.

668
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Look at our secret secret.

669
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,920
This is good, right?

670
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,920
I'm so soft.

671
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
I'm softer than this.

672
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
I'm softer than this.

673
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,920
I trust you.

674
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,920
I trust you.

675
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
I trust you.
