1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Suscription

2
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,700
For what?

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's find Kadeen quickly.

4
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,500
Pass!

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,700
Prepare to report to the court.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,900
Saphat.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,700
You die.

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,300
Saphat.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Sake. Sake.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,700
Sake.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,700
Sake.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Sake.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Are you going to let me and Kadeen leave like this

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,700
without meeting with the prince?

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Can I wait for a few more days?

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,700
No.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
This situation is too complicated.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
You agree with us

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,700
and apologize to you and Kadeen for not sending you.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Is Kanien still shocked about yesterday?

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
She's fine.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,700
What about you?

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
There are soldiers in the palace all the time

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,700
but you still dare to come in.

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Believe me, there's no time left.

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,700
You have to hurry.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
I understand, but…

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
You have to hurry and protect yourself.

29
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
I hope you understand

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
that everything is settled

31
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
and we will go to receive you and Kanien.

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Your Majesty, I have something to do.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Chita, stay here.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
We believe in your skill

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
to protect Chita and Kanien.

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,700
We will send a good soldier to take care of them.

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,700
And the rest will be in our care

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,700
until you leave the palace.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,700
I'm afraid that it may not be suitable.

40
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
What?

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,700
The God's family has always been good.

42
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
We will give them our blessings.

43
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
There must be something that is not suitable.

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Follow this.

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

48
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:38,700
And for the news that cannot be talked about at this time,

50
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
this is the incident in the battle of Japprapeni

51
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
around Ying Thanu in Meenakarin.

52
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
As you can see,

53
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,700
there was an explosion during Ying Thanu's battle.

54
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
And it was reported that

55
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
there were people outside

56
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
who were involved in the battle

57
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
to kill the princess and the prince.

58
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

59
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
P'Ning.

60
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Are you hurt?

61
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
A little bit, Your Majesty.

62
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
But I've taken care of it.

63
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
It's really nothing, Your Majesty.

64
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,700
How is the wound?

65
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
The doctor has taken the wound out.

66
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I think…

67
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

68
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
The wound of the god of death is dangerous.

69
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Thank you

71
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,700
for protecting me and the god of death.

72
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
Why did you protect him?

73
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,700
You don't know who did this to your mother.

74
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Can you tell me

75
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
what it means

76
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
to be a father

77
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,700
who made my mother…

78
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Ning.

79
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Listen to me.

80
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
I know it all along.

81
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
The past

82
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
has nothing to do with you.

83
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I know it all.

84
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I know it all.

85
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
I know it all.

86
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
I'm not sure

87
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
if you know about this.

88
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Why?

89
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I don't want you to worry.

90
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
But I know from the prince

91
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
that you know everything.

92
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Starting from

93
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
the person who made my mother leave you.

94
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,700
Have you ever been so sure?

95
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
Actually,

96
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
I've thought about it before.

97
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
But it's not true.

98
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Chita,

99
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Please forgive me.

101
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Chita had to sacrifice her family to take care of us.

103
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,700
It's my honor.

104
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Mom.

105
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Mom, don't go.

106
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
But I was very young.

108
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
One day when she was born,

109
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
she would understand me.

110
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Mom.

111
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Mom, I'm sorry.

112
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
The path was so steep that I followed you.

113
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,700
There must be a light.

114
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Mom.

115
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Mom.

116
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Mom.

117
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Mom.

118
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Mom.

119
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
As you know,

120
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
it's the skill of the prince, Wasin,

121
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,700
who wants to surround Chita's princess.

122
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,700
The person who saw the incident that night was Tatthai.

123
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Princess.

124
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Princess.

125
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Chita.

126
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Chita.

127
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Hurry up.

128
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Princess.

129
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
Princess.

130
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
When Mr. Tharanai came to the house,

131
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
I would have followed him.

132
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
It must be because of that day.

133
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Mom.

134
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Mom.

135
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
So I made you dislike the rain.

136
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm sorry.

137
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,700
If so,

138
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,700
I think what you said is not wrong.

139
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Because Asawat Theewatin…

140
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
No.

141
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
The duty of the angel to protect,

142
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
is not because of the order,

143
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,700
but because of the promise.

144
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Aren't you mad at me?

145
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
You had to leave

146
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
but you're still the survivor.

147
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,700
Do I look like a person who has no reason?

148
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
If it was you,

149
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
you wouldn't know that…

150
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm not mad at you.

151
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm not mad at anyone.

152
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Everything

153
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
is something that no one wants to happen.

154
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
The angel of justice has come to an end.

155
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
But

156
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
you're not mad at anyone.

157
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
I'm not mad at anyone.

158
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
How can I fight for you

159
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
when you're the cause of my mom's death?

160
00:14:50,700 --> 00:15:11,660
You were still a

161
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,700
mother.

162
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I don't think you feel like this.

163
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I feel like this.

164
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
I feel

165
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,700
that if I use my heart to take care of something,

166
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
I will love

167
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
and care about that thing for the rest of my life.

168
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
I'm sorry.

169
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I'm sorry.

170
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
You don't have to worry about me

171
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
because I've finished my rest.

172
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I don't have to worry about you

173
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
because I've finished my rest.

174
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm sorry.

175
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Chakri.

176
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Yes?

177
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Chakri.

178
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Yes?

179
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Wait.

180
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Go to sleep.

181
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
No.

182
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
No? Wait.

183
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Why did you just wake up?

184
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm here to visit you.

185
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Hurry up.

186
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
You disappeared

187
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
so fast.

188
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Are you safe?

189
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
You're worried about someone else.

190
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
I'm safe.

191
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
How are you doing?

192
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
I'm better.

193
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I heard that

194
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
the life of the living god is better.

195
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
You should go back to the medical staff

196
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
and go back to the hospital.

197
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes.

198
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Do you remember the clip

199
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
of the prince Khaowin from Buja

200
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
who was involved in a riot

201
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,700
at the temple in Emalee?

202
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
That clip has become viral

203
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
and the press has been saying

204
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
that Khaowin was called to Buja

205
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
and the state government has also announced

206
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,700
that Khaowin's act was illegal.

207
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Buja is not involved in the riot in Emalee.

208
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Khaowin should be in jail.

209
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
I'm sorry.

210
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
As the representative of the living god,

211
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I announce that the prince has been released.

212
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Please give him a present.

213
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Since Meennanakarin has been released,

214
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,700
the authority of Meennanakarin's government

215
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
must be returned to the central department.

216
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
We will handle the conflict that Meennanakarin has.

217
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
What will you do about this conflict?

218
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Your Majesty,

219
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
this is not suitable to talk about now.

220
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
It's okay.

221
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
You know that

222
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
the first round of the competition was not successful.

223
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
And the result of the shooting competition was a tie.

224
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
And we still can't

225
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
start the shooting competition as usual.

226
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
So we want to consult with you first.

227
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
You mean there will be no competition like that?

228
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,700
I want the living god's situation to get better first.

229
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
When the time comes,

230
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
we will come to discuss about the shooting competition again.

231
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Let me be honest, Your Majesty.

232
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
If the living god is in trouble,

233
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
the competition must continue.

234
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Your Majesty, how can you say that?

235
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
I'm sorry.

236
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
As your Majesty said,

237
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
we have tried to evaluate the situation.

238
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,700
We still can't guarantee the safety of the royal family.

239
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
But if something happens,

240
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
it will be worse than before.

241
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Damn it!

242
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Those devils

243
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
don't want me to be the king

244
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
so they stopped the competition like this.

245
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Even though you are about to win.

246
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
What's wrong with you?

247
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Are you kidding me?

248
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
I'm not satisfied, Your Majesty.

249
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Is this your dissatisfaction?

250
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
I'm just asking.

251
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,700
You are not a good person.

252
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Please don't, Your Majesty.

253
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Get out of here. Get out!

254
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

255
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
What are you talking about?

256
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:02,900
Huh?

257
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
Who do you think you are?

258
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Huh?

259
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

260
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I should…

261
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
You should…

262
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
You should have been in the position.

263
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Don't get up.

264
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,700
This time, I will teach you

265
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
who is the king and who is the king.

266
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Rammin, step on him.

267
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Step on him.

268
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I refuse.

269
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
You want me to be so angry, right?

270
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,700
I order you to step on him now.

271
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Step on him.

272
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Step on him.

273
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
Step on him.

274
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Then,

275
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,700
you know who you are and who you are, right?

276
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
Huh?

277
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:34,900
Huh?

278
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:05,900
I'm sorry.

279
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm sorry.

281
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
I'm sorry

283
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
because I know

284
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
there's a curse

285
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,700
because the curse will protect me.

286
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
I've always protected you, haven't I?

287
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,700
No one has dared to mess with you in the past.

288
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
But not with the queen or the king, right?

289
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
I'm sorry.

290
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,700
I tried.

291
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
I'm sorry.

292
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,700
I have to turn it down to you.

293
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I can't do it.

294
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Please let me

295
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
let it end here.

296
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Do you know what you're talking about?

297
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Even though it's a story,

298
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
I will be the king of all the gods.

299
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
No.

300
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
But in real life,

301
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
I have a dream.

302
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
And I want to be accepted

303
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,700
as a lover.

304
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Where are you going, Tine?

305
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
I'm going to the temple.

306
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Thank you for protecting me.

307
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Thank you.

308
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Thank you

309
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
for taking care of and protecting Asawat Theewatin.

310
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
I'll be waiting over there.

311
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
I'll be waiting over there.

312
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,700
Thank you.

313
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Protect, take care, and protect and protect Asawat Theewatin.

314
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
I will do my duty

315
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
as the leader of the gods from now on.

316
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
I'm sorry.

317
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
You talk to your mother so fast.

318
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
You can talk longer.

319
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I can wait.

320
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
Thank you.

321
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
I'm sorry.

322
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm sorry.

323
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Since the living god has been revived,

324
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
you have an order to call the meeting of the royal family.

325
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
So I invited all of you here today.

326
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
The Meta Twitter account also wishes to express their congratulations

327
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
that the living god has been revived.

328
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,700
The audience also wishes to express their congratulations

329
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
with this good news.

330
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Can we go in?

331
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,700
We must thank you for your contribution to Asawat Theewatin.

332
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
But I'm still worried.

333
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
It's not convenient to let them in now.

334
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I think we will have a chance to visit the living god today.

335
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
If we don't let them in,

336
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,700
what will be the meeting of the royal family?

337
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,700
The living god has ordered the competition of this kind.

338
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,700
You need the competition to continue.

339
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,700
The living god thinks that the competition of this country

340
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
should be as usual.

341
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,700
It's the last sword fight and the winner will be decided.

342
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,700
Please allow me to inform you.

343
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Please.

344
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,700
I have already paid the fee for the safety of the royal family.

345
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,700
But the living god will not participate in this competition.

346
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,700
This is up to Ms. Aewa, the daughter we are proud of.

347
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
I have always practiced.

348
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,700
The right to compete in the living god

349
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
is the right of the granddaughters of the gods.

350
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
I will prove myself to the godfather.

351
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Your skill of shooting arrows is very good.

352
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I tried hard because I didn't want to lose to anyone and wanted to prove myself.

353
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
I would like to thank Ms. Aewa.

354
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
You are very good at the law of balance.

355
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
I want to prove that I am a woman and I didn't make you fall in love with anyone.

356
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,700
I will prove myself.

357
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Until I encountered a chaos in the competition.

358
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,700
This competition is not clean anymore.

359
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
Ms. Aewa.

360
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
This competition is just a game of power.

361
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
You don't have to prove anything.

362
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
I will take off now.

363
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:19,700
So in conclusion, there are only two left in the archery competition.

364
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
It's Asawat and the finalists.

365
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Ram and Kha-Nin.

366
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Nothing is wrong, right?

367
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,000
No.

368
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Father, can I express my thoughts?

370
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Go ahead.

371
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think the situation is not suitable to continue this competition.

372
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Let's wait for the godfather's condition to get better first.

373
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I can't.

374
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Because you are the one who ordered that the competition should continue as soon as possible.

375
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I have another thing to inform you.

376
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The government will announce the end of the court of the king of Vassin

377
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
from the incident during the journey.

378
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And then there will be a trial of the Minanakarin family

379
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
to show their regret.

380
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This decision is the best.

381
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But what about the protection of the Minanakarin people?

382
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Since the king of Vassin has no heir.

383
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Let the Minanakarin people decide on the leader from the comfort.

384
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Is it good or not?

385
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
It's good.

386
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The king of Vassin must choose a leader with the right quality.

387
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Ram's idea is very good.

388
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But the leader is not the Minanakarin family.

389
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's very suspicious.

390
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
The fact that we hide the truth from the Minanakarin family

391
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
is considered to be enough.

392
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
For example, we think that the king of Vassin

393
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
will choose the leader of the Minanakarin family that is suitable.

394
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And we will find out about this again.

395
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And why don't we let the Minanakarin people

396
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
have the right to choose the leader by themselves?

397
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's a very interesting question.

398
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You mean the election, right?

399
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yes.

400
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Thank you for the direct question.

401
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
But I have to ask for a rejection.

402
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And about the leader of the Minanakarin people,

403
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
let it be as we said before.

404
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Can I talk to you?

406
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
My best friend, my daughter.

407
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Do you have any disappointment in me?

408
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No.

409
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I just thought that

410
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I just saw that we had a chance to change.

411
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I know that you want to change.

412
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You want Emily to have a country.

413
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's all, my daughter.

414
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You just want to win.

415
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
If we win, will you change your mind?

416
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I will do my best.

417
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And why did you reject me at the meeting?

418
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What you want to do is to tell everyone in that room

419
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
to give up their duties.

420
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's not easy for you to give up like that.

421
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And what if I give up?

422
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
If you win, you will see yourself in the future.

423
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Nim, my best friend asked me to tell you that

424
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Have you finished the news about the murder?

426
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes.

427
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,580
Even the

428
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
family of the victim

429
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
can still be blamed

430
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for not knowing what the cause is.

431
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You don't know anymore?

432
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It should be like that.

433
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll go to the doctor.

434
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
No need.

435
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm sorry too, darling.

437
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm sorry for what I did to you

438
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and Emily.

439
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You did it for our family and Emily.

440
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That's why this question looks good to me.

441
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I thought of a way

442
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
to force us to do everything for the rest of our lives.

443
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And deep down,

444
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
we may not be satisfied.

445
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If I didn't tell you about this,

446
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
you would be very sad, right?

447
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I may not have helped you at all.

449
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I was sad during that time.

450
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But now it's over.

451
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I think we should help each other to fix what we have missed.

452
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
If I die before

453
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the competition,

454
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I'll close the door first.

455
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'll wait for the competition to be over before I announce it.

456
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
How can you do that?

457
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
All my life I've been waiting for is to make God know.

458
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
God knows?

459
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And even if I die,

460
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I won't stop the God's will.

461
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I will definitely win.

462
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I believe in that.

463
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Please forgive me.

464
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I'm sorry for the cause that made everything like this.

465
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You fought for Asawat and won for Emily.

466
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Can you stop now?

467
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes.

468
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
What's wrong?

471
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Are you worried about tomorrow?

472
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I want to change Emily.

473
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I want to help her solve the problem.

474
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm not sure.

475
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Don't worry.

476
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll do my best.

477
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The pressure…

478
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The pressure that is not too much is a good pressure.

479
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
But if it's too much, I can't sleep.

480
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
If you can't sleep, I won't sleep with you.

481
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You're heavy. Are you okay?

483
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm okay.

484
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Ready?

485
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Go!

486
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Go!

487
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Ready?

488
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Go!

489
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Go!

490
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You're so good.

491
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You're so good.

492
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You're the best.

493
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
If we can win the competition, I'm relieved.

494
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I'll compete with you.

495
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let's change clothes and compete.

496
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Please.

497
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's compete.

498
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Go!

499
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You're so good.

500
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Ready?

501
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Come on in. Why are you still standing?

502
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
You have everything.

503
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
What?

504
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Come on.

505
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Where are you going?

506
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We won.

507
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
We won.

508
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
We've been in the same boat for years.

509
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Pong, get up.

510
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You can beat Karnin. Get up.

511
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Don't go in.

512
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Get up, Karnin.

513
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Soon, the most powerful judge will be the biggest in the world.

514
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Get up.

515
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Get up.

516
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Please take a rest.

517
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Is P'Tine here?

518
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
He's not here.

519
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
He's not here.

520
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You've been taking care of me, right?

521
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I told you that I've been gone since you visited me.

522
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You can do it.

523
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Breathe.

524
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You need to breathe.

525
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Breathe in.

526
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Breathe out.

527
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Is it better?

528
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm going to fight.

529
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You can do it.

530
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
The Royal Battle of the Fist of the Sword

531
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
between the most respected Ramin

532
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
and the most respected Khanin,

533
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
please welcome the most respected Khanin and Ramin

534
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
to the stage.

535
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
This is the biggest battle

536
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
in the history of our country.

537
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
This is the battle between the most respected king

538
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and the most respected king, At-Sawa-Tay-Wa-Tin.

539
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
On guard.

540
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Ready.

541
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Go.

542
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The Royal Battle of the Fist of the Sword

543
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Please welcome

544
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Ramin.

545
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Khanin.

546
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You're still the same.

547
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You were like when you first answered me.

548
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You're still a normal person.

549
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
If you have time, call me.

550
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Send me often.

551
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Goodbye, Sir.

552
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Chakri is going to London.

553
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
It's time to go.

554
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The Royal Battle of the Fist of the Sword

555
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Can you do it?

556
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Chakri

557
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Every minute

558
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Not just us

559
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Hold me

560
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And every moment

561
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Let love take you

562
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Listen to the heart

563
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
