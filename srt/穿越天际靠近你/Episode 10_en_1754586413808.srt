1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The story they told about Muang Nid and Tuen,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
someone died because of Asawat Theewatthin?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, because of the order from the King of the Empire.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I think he has power to do anything.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to study about the act of the King of the Empire.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't want to see your face anymore.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When I return to the King of the Empire,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
there will be a big event soon.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So this time we will build a new memory together.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who are you? Why are you helping me?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm Metit, Tuen Charan.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm glad that you came here.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I wish Asawat Theewatthin a good night's sleep.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm glad that you came too.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You must be tired and hungry.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's go to the dining room.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Come and sit with me.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Eat a lot.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you need anything, just tell me.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's continue.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why does this spaghetti look like…

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You taught me how to make it.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You made it yourself?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think you will feel better after making the taste that you used to.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thank you, Father.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is the first time that you have stood like Asawat Theewatthin.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
From now on, you must come to this place.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will be waiting for you.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you have something to ask,

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
will you accept me or not?

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What do you mean?

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Not long ago, there was a news about a girl

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
who was sick in the city.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Have you seen the news?

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is the incident that caused the sick people in the city true?

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I was looking for an answer for that.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But you have to tell me.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let me handle it.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For now,

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you should go to Asawat Theewatthin's farewell party

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and take her there.

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We love you.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We love you.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We love you.

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We love you.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We love you.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We love you.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We love you.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We love you.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We love you.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We love you.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We love you.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We love you.

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We love you.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We love you.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We love you.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We love you.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We love you.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We love you.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We love you.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We love you.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We love you.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We love you.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We love you.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We love you.

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We love you.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here comes Westrop Formation.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Episode 8

75
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,100
We have arrived, Sir

76
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,860
Pleaseessa滴ตรกระมอง

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How long will the firework last?

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
About 30 minutes.

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why does it have to be long?

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because people in the past worked in the city mainly.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They quit their jobs at night and sometimes in the morning.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The way back home is probably boring.

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It makes some villagers afraid of what they can't see.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But it's good that the star has a light to guide them.

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So the villagers gave the firework as a symbol

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to thank the star's light

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and to wish for the success of the city.

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this is the kind of thing that the villagers answered, right?

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is there anything that you can't answer?

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know everything.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not true. You can answer everything I ask.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If it's something you're not good at, I can't answer this question.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It means there's nothing you can answer.

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Because I'm good at everything.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Do you want to buy a candle?

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Chakri, let's buy a lighter.

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay.

99
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go.

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's time for Ang Ang to come back.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I won't touch you.

102
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ang Ang.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, Khun Chai.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I want one.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Here you are.

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This year is not selling well. There are few tourists.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm telling the truth because there's news about the dust.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So people don't dare to come to visit.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm afraid it will hurt.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not good in the city.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm talking in the old language.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Have fun.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Have fun, Khun Chai.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What's wrong?

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you okay?

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I saw it already.

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes.

123
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Dad, that's Tartanai's dad.

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's get going.

125
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Min.

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
P'Lan, let go.

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you really going to know that it's you?

128
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Min, there are many people here. It might not be true.

129
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You'll know when you know it's not true. Let go, Min.

130
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Min.

131
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Min, someone's coming.

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,040
Understood.

133
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't move.

134
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:23,400
The

135
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
OK, sorry.

136
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Excuse me.

137
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,960
Excuse me.

138
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,640
Handle this 9 durr system quiz truth.

139

advantage and help

142
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes.

143
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
We have power to solve the problem of the government.

144
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,960
If we stop working, will the M-1E survive?

145
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Yes.

146
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Guys, let's make our voice heard to the police today.

147
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Yes.

148
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,960
We are here to solve the problem and call for help.

149
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
How long have we called for help?

150
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,960
You said you didn't know that we were going to die, right?

151
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Yes.

152
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Yes.

153
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
It's like this.

154
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,960
We have checked, but there is no response yet.

155
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
You guys are just standing there watching the other's happiness.

156
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Let's go.

157
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Let's go.

158
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Let's go.

159
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Let's go.

160
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Let's go.

161
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Let's go.

162
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Let's go.

163
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Let's go.

164
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Let's go.

165
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Let's go.

166
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Let's go.

167
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Calm down.

168
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Calm down.

169
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Tell us what the cause is.

170
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Power is in the right hand.

171
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
If you can't handle it, get out.

172
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Yes.

173
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Don't block the way.

174
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
The fire department is coming.

175
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I don't see the cause.

176
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
It depends on the number of the people. Get out.

177
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Go.

178
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Guys, get out.

179
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Get out and chase them.

180
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Let them know what kind of importance this kind of people are.

181
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Get out.

182
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
Get out.

183
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Get out.

184
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Guys, don't use your power.

185
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
We want to use our power.

186
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
We have power to solve the problem.

187
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Calm down.

188
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
I can remind you of your father and mother.

189
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
But now I will help the people.

190
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Find the official who should die.

191
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
I will be the first one to kill.

192
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
I will kill.

193
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Rin.

194
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
It's okay.

195
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
I believe you.

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
What's this?

197
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Hey, son.

198
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
What kind of son are you?

199
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
You shouldn't do this.

200
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Sir.

201
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
We have seen the problem.

202
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Now we think that in this emergency situation,

203
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
we should solve the problem first.

204
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,960
We will send N95 mask and air supply to the people in the city.

205
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,960
And then we will keep an eye on the situation and solve the problem.

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,960
We will find a way to help to reduce the dust.

207
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I beg you.

208
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Can you help us escape from the fire?

209
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
We will really help you.

210
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
I promise.

211
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
How can we trust you?

212
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
That's right.

213
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
How can we believe that what you did is not just for the sake of the image?

214
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Image.

215
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Image.

216
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Trust me.

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
We will help everyone.

218
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
What the people call us is important.

219
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
We promise to help fix it.

220
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,960
But the current fire is not spreading on the roof.

221
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,960
And now the people who are spreading it have to be treated.

222
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,960
So please help us avoid the fire.

223
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,960
Keep your eyes open wide

224
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Every soul deserves to breathe

225
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Don't walk away from silent cries

226
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Each heart longs to live

227
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Whispers in the mist

228
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Always echo never quit

229
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
We rise inside the mist

230
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
They don't see but we persist

231
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Whispers in the mist

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Always echo never quit

233
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,960
Even shadows can resist

234
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Here whispers in the mist

235
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Last night, there was an incident at Asawatthewatin District.

236
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,960
A group of protesters asked for help to stop the fire.

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
They caused an accident.

238
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,960
There are no casualties but there are a few injured people.

239
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,960
And this incident was concluded by Mr. Kanin,

240
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,960
the heir of Asawatthewatin, to help us solve the problem.

241
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
There is a research report that Mr. Kanin

242
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,960
is a sign of change and a new hope of the people.

243
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
How is it?

244
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Come on.

245
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
You have to come back with your son.

246
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Your son's safety is the most important thing.

247
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
I understand your son's problem.

248
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
You are handling this.

249
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
But in the end, you have no power as you thought you had.

250
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
I want to solve the problem.

251
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
I'm sorry.

252
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I think we should wait for you to come back to life.

253
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I've been followed all my life.

254
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I want to rest a little.

255
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Believe every word you say without looking at the truth.

256
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
If you don't want to see Emily, you have to go to the economic crisis.

257
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
Do as we say.

258
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I've never handled anything by myself.

259
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
I have to do it by myself.

260
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
The problem will be solved today.

261
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Power is in your hands. If you can't handle it, get out.

262
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Get out.

263
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I want to change the situation.

264
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,960
But today, all power is still in my hands.

265
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,960
And many things may not work as we thought.

266
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
So if you have more power,

267
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
everything will be easier and faster, right?

268
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
If you want to change Emily,

269
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,960
the will to win is another way to help this country.

270
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I will do my best to win this competition.

271
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
I will do my best.

272
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
You shouldn't do it.

273
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I just helped to distribute the work of the Secretary.

274
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
So I shouldn't do it.

275
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I will handle it.

276
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
You shouldn't interfere.

277
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Your job is to prepare for the competition.

278
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Sir, I will win the competition.

279
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I will do it.

280
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
If you don't want to do anything,

281
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I will wait for the day you do it yourself.

282
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
You can say what you want.

283
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
You know how to solve the problem.

284
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Do you think you can finish it by following the staff?

285
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Changing the situation takes time.

286
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Changing the situation requires courage and real intention.

287
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,960
If you just wait to know everything, you don't have to do anything.

288
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
If there's nothing else, I will leave.

289
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Now the soldiers have forgotten to follow you.

290
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
I have to be more careful.

291
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Do you think Sir Kanin sees you?

292
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Yes.

293
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
What are you going to do next?

294
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I have to hide.

295
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
I want Kanin to focus on the competition.

296
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I don't want him to focus on me.

297
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
You are a good person.

298
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
You saved your niece's life,

299
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
but you have to be ordered to hide.

300
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
You act like a dead person.

301
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
This is really a plan to kill each other.

302
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I understand the reason why you came to live.

303
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
Kanin has to adapt to Emily and have to compete.

304
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I don't want him to focus on me.

305
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,960
You are a good person.

306
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
You understand everything.

307
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,960
But if it's me, I've shared it.

308
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,960
If it's me, I've shared it.

309
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Have you ever fallen into the water?

310
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,960
If the fish is big and strong, can you pull it up?

311
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Or will it pull you down into the water?

312
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
I won't give up easily.

313
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I won't give up easily.

314
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,960
If it's really necessary, I will pull it up no matter what.

315
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
What if it's the biggest fish in the sea?

316
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
It's big enough to eat small fish.

317
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
You can get all the small fish anytime.

318
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Can you beat it?

319
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
I can't.

320
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
If all the fish cooperate,

321
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
I won't let it eat.

322
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
No matter how big it is, it can't live for a day.

323
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Sit down.

324
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,960
You must know that the chief is here at Emily.

325
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,960
We let people control her, but she ran away.

326
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
I have to order you, right?

327
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
So I won't get involved with the case of the chief.

328
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
What do you want to say to me?

329
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I'm worried that I can't hide the truth about Mr.Hannai from you.

330
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,960
But I promise you that you will meet Mr.That when the time is right.

331
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I've been taking care of you all the time.

332
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
I never hold a grudge against you because you are my nephew.

333
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
But this time in your life,

334
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,960
I order you to stop getting involved with the case of Chief Tat.

335
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
Yes, sir.

336
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I'm sorry.

338
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Why didn't you tell me you met your father?

339
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Is it an order?

340
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Is it a rule?

341
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I know that if you want to be with me,

342
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
you have to be with me.

343
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
I know that if you want to meet your father now,

344
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
it may make him not safe.

345
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,960
But can you tell me that you are still fine?

346
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I'm fine.

347
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm taking care of you.

348
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
You can rest assured.

349
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Thank you.

350
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I believe in you.

351
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,960
This competition will start from the competition for the age test.

352
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,960
The executive of the King of Life

353
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,960
will be the one who will prepare and send the participants to the competition before one day.

354
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
The second competition is the shooting competition.

355
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I would like to propose to hold the competition

356
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,960
as usual to the competitors in the forest.

357
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,960
By using the technology of the target.

358
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
And connect it when shooting the target,

359
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
the score will appear at the executive immediately.

360
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
I agree.

361
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,960
It should make the competition more exciting.

362
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Since the King of Life has no heir,

363
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,960
I think the King of Life should handle the long-standing competition

364
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
for justice.

365
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
If everyone agrees, then it's fine.

366
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,960
And the last competition is the sword fighting competition.

367
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,960
The winner will be the one who will send the participants to the next round.

368
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Would you like to take a break?

369
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,960
That's all. Let's go.

370
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,960
The next practice is the shooting competition. This way, please.

371
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
What's wrong with you?

372
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm fine.

373
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
I've taken care of the details of the competition.

374
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I've found a suitable coach for you.

375
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
You can practice with me tomorrow.

376
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,960
What happened?

377
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Don't ask too much. Just do as I said.

378
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Why do I have to change the new coach?

379
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
You're not good at everything.

380
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Meera may be a good trainer,

381
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,960
but Meera is not good at everything.

382
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Having a good coach will help our Meta community receive me.

383
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I've found the best thing for my daughter.

384
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
That's not true. Because Meera is a woman, right?

385
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Yes. If the two families know that the trainer is a woman,

386
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
they will be more confused and look down on us.

387
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I have two choices for you.

388
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
One, let your daughter continue practicing with Meera.

389
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Or two, let your daughter get out of this competition.

390
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Why don't you listen to me?

391
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,960
If you have nothing else, I'll go to practice first.

392
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Well…

393
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Follow me.

394
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,960
It seems that you have a problem

395
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
about Ava's shop.

396
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm aware of this.

397
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
If it's not too much,

398
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
can I ask what happened?

399
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,960
It's hard for our tribe to have a woman as a woman.

400
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm still concerned.

401
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
There is a female coach.

402
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
I'm afraid that if anyone knows,

403
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
they may think that it's not appropriate.

404
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,960
If so, don't be too hard on yourself.

405
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Winning a man is not a bad thing.

406
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
If both can practice and get along well.

407
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,960
And Meera also has a unique skill.

408
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,960
It's not easy to find a coach like her.

409
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm sorry.

410
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Madam, I don't want you to have a problem with the champion.

411
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
You are my person.

412
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
No matter what anyone says, you don't have to listen.

413
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Just listen to me.

414
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
But the order…

415
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,960
If you want me to compete,

416
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
you must have a coach.

417
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
I'm sorry.

418
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,960
I want to rest.

419
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm sorry.

420
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Why do you have to force yourself like this?

421
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
There are less than two weeks left.

422
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
But I can't take it anymore.

423
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm sorry.

424
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Okay, then can I follow you?

425
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Well, I can accept a little more.

426
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I can't hear your name.

427
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Okay, I'll follow you.

428
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
I can't.

429
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,960
If you read a few more pages,

430
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
Don't argue with us.

431
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Okay.

432
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm glad that I'm trying to practice my language better than before.

434
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,960
It's probably because I have a platform to support me.

435
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
I know my duty so I don't have to be punished.

436
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Know your duty so you don't have to be punished.

437
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
I'll help you.

438
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
The competition is coming.

439
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
I want you to focus more.

440
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
I'm tired.

441
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
I'm tired.

442
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,960
I'm tired like a pillow.

443
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
I can sleep with my head down.

444
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,960
This competition is a family competition.

445
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,960
If you want to be strong, you have to give up something.

446
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
What if I want something else before I give up?

447
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
That too.

448
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm sorry.

449
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I'm sorry.

450
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,960
Ouch!

451
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Does it hurt?

452
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,960
No matter how hard you work,

453
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
if you don't know how to rest, it's hurting yourself.

454
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I've never seen you like this before.

455
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Please rest.

456
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
I'm sorry.

457
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,960
You drank a lot. You won't be able to practice.

458
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
You told me to rest.

459
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
I drank too much.

460
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
You don't understand me.

461
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Is gender not related to the competition?

462
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
I think that you understand that you are protected.

463
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
But you protect yourself.

464
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
You protect yourself.

465
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,960
Why do I have to be a woman?

466
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
No one understands others 100%.

467
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
Only we can understand ourselves best.

468
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
You are the best.

469
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
You can't be a woman,

470
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
but you can be yourself in the best version.

471
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm sorry.

472
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
You are prettier now.

Directed by Kritsada Techanilobon

476
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
This is a good story.

477
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,960
I saw it on the wall and took it.

478
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,960
I thought it was because the four families were working together

479
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:56,380
that I got the

480
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,960
book and made it into a love song.

481
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,960
I'm surprised that I feel that this book

482
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
doesn't match with other stories.

483
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Because history is up to the writer.

484
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
True.

485
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
Although I wrote it based on evidence,

486
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
it's still what I wrote.

487
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm still thinking about it.

488
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,960
History and love are as you understand.

489
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Some people say that the real audience

490
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
doesn't want to share power with anyone.

491
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Power is in the group. Who will share power with anyone?

492
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
But in the end, they lost the war.

493
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
So they tried to fight against another family.

494
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
They fought against another family

495
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,960
until they got the conclusion that they had to win.

496
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
And then they started a competition

497
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
to see who won the war.

498
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
How?

499
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
I'm tired.

500
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I'm tired too.

501
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm tired.

502
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,960
I'm tired too.

503
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
We've seen the problem.

504
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Now we think that in this emergency,

505
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
we should fix the problem first.

506
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,960
We will find a way to help to reduce the cost of the rain.

507
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
How are you?

508
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
You may not remember because you were still a kid.

509
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,960
But I remember that and never forget.

510
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Are you okay?

511
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
I'm okay.

512
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,960
The truth is the truth.

513
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,960
I hope you can separate the past from the past.

514
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
That it has nothing to do with him.

515
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
I know.

516
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
Thank you for telling me the truth.

517
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,960
Let's talk.

518
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Don't think too much.

519
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:24,960
That's all.

520
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,960
Okay.

521
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,960
I'm sorry.

522
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Min?

523
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Is something wrong?

524
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
I'm sorry.

525
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
Did you get the chance?

526
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
It's late.

527
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,960
Why are you here with me?

528
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
I miss you.

529
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Well…

530
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,960
I want you to draw me a picture.

531
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
I think you should go to bed now.

532
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,960
I can.

533
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,960
But I want to sleep here.

534
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
I'm stressed.

535
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,960
I want to find something to relax.

536
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Okay.

537
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,960
Nim.

538
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
Nim.

539
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Have you ever told me

540
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
that when you were comfortable,

541
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,960
you would always be with me?

542
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
I'm not going to lie to you.

543
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Maybe I want you to draw me a picture.

544
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,960
I'm telling the truth.

545
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,960
I'm sorry.

546
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,960
Can you do this?

547
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,960
I'm sorry.

548
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,960
I want you to draw me a picture.

549
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:44,960
I want the face of the person who is looking at you.

550
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,960
Run.

551
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,960

737
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,020

738
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Will you be mine?

739
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,020
From now on,

740
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:08,020
every minute is not just about us.

741
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:15,020
Hold my hand and tell me every story.

742
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,020
Let love take you away.
