3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,280
I wish for Charan

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,440
to be my coach, Grandfather.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,400
I am not a bargaining chip.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,040
All I ask

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,280
is to have you by my side.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Anyway,

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,360
I shall be your coach from now on.

10
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,150
Ouch...

11
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,410
- Can't you be gentle?
- Please don't move.

12
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
It's okay. Be at ease.

13
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,630
What happened?

14
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,160
His Royal Highness had a minor injury
during training, Your Royal Highness.

15
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,760
Let's get the doctors here.

16
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
It's nothing serious, Father.

17
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,160
His Royal Highness simply misstepped,

18
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
causing him to fall and twist his ankle.

19
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm giving him first aid,
Your Royal Highness.

20
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
Let's have Khanin
take a break for now, then.

21
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
I need a word with my son.

23
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Khanin,

24
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,320
no matter how important
the Competition is

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,320
to the Assavadevathins,

26
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,600
nothing is more important to me than you.

27
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
I don't want to see you hurt again.

28
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I will be more careful, Father.

29
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
Khanin,

30
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,640
before you do anything,

31
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,160
you must first compose yourself.

32
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,360
You're lucky. This is not bad.

33
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
- Oh...
- Your Royal Highness...

34
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,400
Your Royal Highness...

35
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,000
Please have a seat.

36
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I want to wash my hair.

37
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,150
Wash your hair? Oh...

38
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,080
Then, please wait a moment.

39
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,240
Since you dye your hair often,

40
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,480
I recommend using Lolane Intense Care.

41
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
It helps detangle messy hair,
making it soft

42
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,120
and easy to comb in just seven seconds.

43
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Lolane!

44
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah.

45
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,920
The geographical landscape
of Meenanagarin,

46
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
the southern city of Emmaly,

47
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,340
is characterized by rainforests

48
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,560
or tropical rainforests.

49
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,680
The city lies along the coast,

50
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,480
and its main export commodity is pearls.

51
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,840
Pearls?

52
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,200
Especially the world-renowned
dark champagne pearls.

53
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,000
This is beautiful.

54
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,080
But they probably cost a lot, don't they?

55
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,760
Dark champagne pearls are the priciest.

56
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
And...

57
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,320
is Meenanagarin far from here?

58
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,000
It is the closest to Davin City

59
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,880
and has the second-largest population
after Davin City.

60
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
Your Royal Highness...

61
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,120
I'd love to see the dark champagne pearls
with my own eyes.

62
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,160
I believe that the treasury here...

63
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
Not Grandfather's pearls

64
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,520
nor the Assavadevathins'.

65
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
I want to see ones...

66
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,400
that are accessible to other people.

67
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,000
We still have time.

68
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,080
Actually, we can just go to Meenanagarin
to see them.

69
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
But your ankle has just healed.

70
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,160
- I think...
- It's just healed.

71
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,360
That means it's already healed.

72
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Look.

73
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,620
I can walk around now.

74
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,840
Please take me there.

75
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,380
Please.

76
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,400
It's not far, you said.

77
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,480
If you wish to go out now,

78
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,920
you may only

79
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
be able to visit the pearl shop

80
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,040
behind the university,
Your Royal Highness.

81
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,680
Alright, let's go there.

82
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,760
Chakri!

83
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm going to the market
behind the university.

84
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,440
Charan's coming with me.

85
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
You don't need to come, right?

86
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,360
Okay?

87
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Chakri said we could go.

88
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,760
Your Royal Highness,

89
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,120
please slow down.

90
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
If I do that,

91
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,720
you'll have to talk to me casually,

92
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
okay?

93
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
That would be improper.

94
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Your Royal Highness!

95
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
Freshly grilled pork right here.

96
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,840
Here you go.

97
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,400
Would you like some freshly grilled pork?

98
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,920
Sure.

99
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,760
Charan...

100
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Is that one good?

101
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
Would you like to try some?

102
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Well...

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,680
I can't imagine
how the flavors would blend.

104
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,680
[Grilled pork with milk tea]

105
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,480
This dish used to be only for miners

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,040
as they needed energy-boosting food
that was quick and easy to eat,

107
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,360
so they combined
savory and sweet tastes in one.

108
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,440
But since the taste was too unusual,

109
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
they added spices to improve it.

110
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
Thanks.

111
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,440
Would you like some grilled pork?
They're still warm.

112
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,520
How do you sell these?

113
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,240
Oh,

114
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,120
Prince Khanin.

115
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,920
How much would you like,
Your Royal Highness?

116
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
One set, please.

117
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
You want some?

118
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm good, Your Royal Highness.

119
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,880
We'll get one set, then.

120
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,120
Sure.

121
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,410
Here you are.

122
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,320
One emma, please.

123
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,840
The milk tea tastes pretty odd,

124
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,600
but with the grilled pork,

125
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
they're a good combo.

126
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,520
You should try some.

127
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
I...

128
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,080
I know you've tried it before,

129
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,520
but I want you to join me.

130
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,640
Isn't it good?

131
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Hey,

132
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,800
give me a smile.

133
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
It's inappropriate to do it here.

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,400
Come on, it won't hurt.

135
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Smile.

136
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,720
Give me a smile.

137
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Do you even know how to smile?

138
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Come on.

139
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
That's it.

140
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,900
Let's go.

141
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,980
This way, Your Royal Highness.

142
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,470
[Smooth skin starts at Gangnam Clinic]

143
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,960
Do you have any dark champagne pearls
from Meenanagarin?

144
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,900
Well,

145
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,140
the pearls are in high demand now,
Your Royal Highness.

146
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,720
They're hard to come by

147
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,760
and must be ordered in advance.

148
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,520
Shall we order it now,
Your Royal Highness?

149
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,760
Well...

150
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
So we came all this way for nothing.

151
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
I truly apologize, Your Royal Highness.

152
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,160
If you wish to see it,

153
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
I know a place I can take you to.

154
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,640
This is the manor of the Phithakthewas.

155
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,560
How beautiful.

156
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,320
So it's only you and your butler
in this whole place?

157
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,960
This manor was built
when Emmaly was first founded.

158
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,600
The Phithakthewas have long served
as royal guards to the Assavadevathins.

159
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,760
Royal guards?

160
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Oh, so the reason you don't fence
in front of others

161
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
is because you're part of
a royal guard clan?

162
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,160
That's right.

163
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,520
A royal guard's powers
ought not to be exposed to enemies.

164
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,040
Right.

165
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,560
This way, please.

166
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,480
This is where I spend most of my time.

167
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,040
It's where I paint.

168
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,520
I would've mistaken this for a gallery
if you hadn't told me.

169
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,520
It doesn't look anything like
an old manor of a royal guard clan.

170
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,440
Did you paint all of these yourself?

171
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,760
I did most of the paintings myself,

172
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,680
but some,

173
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
like this one,

174
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,020
were done by my mother.

175
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
Wow, so everyone in your family
is good at painting, right?

176
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
Not exactly,

177
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,920
but painting is something I really enjoy.

178
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,720
Every time I paint,

179
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,040
it calms me down.

180
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
You should teach me, too.

181
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,030
- I'm afraid that wouldn't be proper.
- "I'm afraid that wouldn't be proper."

182
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,880
I know.

183
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,240
But who gets to decide
what's proper or not?

184
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,320
If you ask me,

185
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,000
I think it's totally alright.

186
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,650
Wait. Hold on.

187
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
This is my private space.

188
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm afraid it's not quite proper.

189
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,200
Please proceed that way.

190
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,600
Why, though?

191
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,160
Can't I be in this room?

192
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Please let me see your paintings.

193
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
I won't cause any trouble, promise.

194
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
Then, give me a moment.

195
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
I'll be right back.

196
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,560
Okay.

197
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,160
What have you got?

198
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,080
These pearls belonged to my mother.

199
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,360
She absolutely adored pearls

200
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,720
and dreamed of
collecting every shade of them.

201
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,770
It all started with this one.

202
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,640
She told me it was a gift from my father

203
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
back when they started dating.

204
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,880
A white pearl,

205
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,920
the color of purity,

206
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,280
sincerity,

207
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
freedom,

208
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,960
and loyalty.

209
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,160
This is the dark champagne pearl
you wanted to see.

210
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,000
It is truly stunning.

211
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,040
My father had it custom-made

212
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,600
and gave it to my mother
on their wedding day.

213
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,320
He seemed so romantic.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If I may...

215
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,080
Now that you've seen it
with your own eyes,

216
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,400
would you still want to
order the dark champagne pearls?

217
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,640
It is truly magnificent.

218
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,640
I want one.

219
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll take care of it.

220
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560
Um...

221
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,480
I think I'd rather go see it
in Meenanagarin myself.

222
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,440
If that chance comes by,

223
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
I'll take you there.

224
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,920
Okay.

225
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
[Prince Khanin and Charan Spotted
Enjoying Market Stroll Together]

226
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
[He's really cute! #PrinceKhanin]

227
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,960
[They've got that
"just started dating" vibe! #PrinceKhanin]

228
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
People are overhyping Khanin.

229
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,140
Why haven't you looked into
Prince Khanin's background

230
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,880
to find something to use against him?

231
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,160
The reason you want me to look into this

232
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,240
is because you're dying to know

233
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,200
if Khanin and Charan

234
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,120
are actually dating, right?

235
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,340
And if they are,

236
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,800
would you be upset?

237
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
There's no reason for me to be upset

238
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,840
because I...

239
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,240
belong to you, Prince Ramil.

240
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
Do you really belong to me?

241
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Khanin?

242
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
How is everything going?

243
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,080
Are you getting used to
living in the palace yet?

244
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,720
I am, Your Royal Highness.

245
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,800
That's great.

246
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
I brought His Majesty
some bird's nest today.

247
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you want to have a taste as well?

248
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,800
It's alright, Your Royal Highness.

249
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,090
I'm not particularly fond of it.

250
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh, really?

251
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
No worries.

252
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,920
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

253
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,360
After all,

254
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,000
the Assavadevathins stand like the sun
over the Meenanagarins.

255
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,280
I shall go to see His Majesty now.

256
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,960
Can I use my hands?

257
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,720
Whatever.

258
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,720
Charan,

259
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
once today's lesson is over,

260
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I'd like to visit the market again.

261
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,320
There are still many things
I haven't tried.

262
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm afraid that would not be possible.

263
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,760
Besides today's lesson,

264
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
you still have fencing training
and archery practice.

265
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Oh, right.

266
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,040
I just ran into Prince Wasin.

267
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,480
He told me that

268
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
the Assavadevathins

269
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,920
stand like the sun
over the Meenanagarins.

270
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,440
Doesn't that sound a little odd?

271
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,760
Perhaps Prince Wasin was implying that

272
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,680
the Meenanagarins

273
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,000
will always remain loyal
to the Assavadevathins.

274
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,400
So that's why he said he stands with me.

275
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,720
Should an Assavadevathin be appointed
King of Emmaly again,

276
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Meenanagarin would surely benefit.

277
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What kind of benefit?

278
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,280
In the past,

279
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,440
when pearls from Meenanagarin
became scarce,

280
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,040
the Assavadevathins allocated a budget
for pearl research,

281
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,450
including the development
of new pearl colors

282
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,800
to increase production.

283
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,680
If Prince Tharin ascends to the throne,

284
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,280
Meenanagarin will likely continue
to receive research funding.

285
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,280
However, since Prince Wasin has no heirs,
his words...

286
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,360
were probably just a gesture of affection
for Your Royal Highness.

287
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
Understood, Professor.

288
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,440
What would I do without you?

289
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,040
Hold this with your left hand.

290
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,480
Pick up the arrow with your right hand.

291
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,520
Set the tip of the arrow here.

292
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
Aim at the target.

293
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Aim at the target.

294
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Let's do it again.

295
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
A yellow pearl,

296
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,680
symbolizing good friendship

297
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,640
and good health.

298
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,560
It's yours now.

299
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
You promised me

300
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,160
you'd take me to Meenanagarin.

301
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,040
I will keep my promise.

302
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,400
Have a good night.

303
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,080
Keep your index finger above

304
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,680
with your middle and ring fingers below.

305
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,200
Concentrate, Khanin.

306
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I did it,

307
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
- didn't I?
- It was likely a fluke.

308
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Now, do it yourself.

309
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,640
Hey!

310
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,120
What?

311
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,440
Have you found the person you were after?

312
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,520
Do you work here?

313
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,480
Do you think this apron
is just an accessory?

314
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Obviously, I work here.

315
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,560
Have you found the person you were after?

316
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,280
No.

317
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
- You haven't?
- Yeah.

318
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,280
I've seen him, though.

319
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm not lying.

320
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
You don't believe me?

321
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,320
I'll take you to him after work.

322
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Are you going back to your country
this holiday?

323
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,960
I don't think so, Your Majesty.

324
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,600
I wish to spend my time off here.

325
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
That is perfect.

326
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,240
Go ahead.

327
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
Are you done with your fencing training?

328
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Come, have a seat.

329
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
I was just speaking with Prince Calvin,

330
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,040
and I thought it'd be best
to have you join us now.

331
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,520
What's the matter, Grandfather?

332
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,800
I see that

333
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,040
you and Prince Calvin
are around the same age.

334
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,920
It'd be nice if you two grew close.

335
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,440
Also, I'd like you to take him on a trip

336
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,440
to Davichmetha for a break.

337
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,520
A trip to Davichmetha?

338
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,260
That's right.

339
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,400
Ramil and Ava will be going along, too.

340
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

341
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,120
Please look after Khanin
and Prince Calvin for me, Charan.

342
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

343
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,920
Why does this palace
feel so unlike the others, Chakri?

344
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,840
Prince Calvin,

345
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
Khanin,

346
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,400
it is my pleasure
to welcome you both in person.

347
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,240
Thank you very much,
Your Royal Highness.

348
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,360
You are all welcome.

349
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,060
It has come to my attention

350
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,040
that Prince Calvin
desires to stay elsewhere.

351
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,880
In truth, this place
would be far more convenient.

352
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,240
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Royal Highness.

353
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,840
I'm not very familiar
with such magnificence.

354
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,160
Actually, I only feel some regret,

355
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
but it's okay.

356
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
As for Khanin,

357
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,040
a guest room
has been arranged over there.

358
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,160
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

359
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,320
I'm sure you'd like to
check out our palace at least a little.

360
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,760
Please, feel free.

361
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,080
Khanin,

362
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
please come this way.

363
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,720
Ava is cozying up to Khanin,

364
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,480
probably hoping to ride his popularity
with the public.

365
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Ridiculous.

366
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,820
But I think

367
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,960
it would be great
if you gained some popularity, too.

368
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
I had some free time,

369
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,240
so I came to see your archery range.

370
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,280
I hope you don't mind
if Khanin's joining us, too.

371
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,910
Of course, I don't.

372
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,720
It's your range after all.

373
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,400
Have you been here for some time now?

374
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
Are you done with the palace tour?

375
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,240
Would you like to try archery with us?

376
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,880
I appreciate your kindness,

377
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,480
but I shall pass for now.

378
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,720
Is there anywhere you'd like to visit?

379
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
There are plenty of beautiful buildings
and places to visit around here.

380
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Well...

381
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,020
Is there anywhere you'd recommend?

382
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,160
I wanna check out the city.

383
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,160
I just looked it up,

384
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
and it looks super interesting.

385
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,280
Since we've already come
all the way from Davin,

386
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
we shall make the most of it.

387
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Would you care to join us?

388
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,920
It's more fun with more company.

389
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
How could I miss a trip
with Prince Calvin?

390
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
Then, I'll book a hotel for us all.

391
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
Chakri, you don't have to come.

392
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,280
Oh...

393
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,920
If my father knows I'm here...

394
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Do not worry.

395
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Let yourself go a little,

396
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
so we can all have fun together.

397
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,280
What is this called?

398
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,520
Davicher, Your Royal Highness.

399
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,760
It's a local apple-based cocktail,

400
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,400
bearing a taste similar to apple cider.

401
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,960
Wow,

402
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,320
that's a unique taste.

403
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
There's nothing of this sort
in my country.

404
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
It's one of Davichmetha's prides,

405
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,760
even though I've never tried it myself.

406
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,200
Since you're already here,
you should give it a try.

407
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
I don't enjoy drinking.

408
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I prefer watching others get drunk.

409
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,750
Come on, Ava.

410
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,920
Try some. It's wonderful.

411
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
No booze, no fun, right?

412
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,520
Sure.

413
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
You're here, Ramil?

414
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,830
Do you see me here?

415
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,360
Ava.

416
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,719
Yes?

417
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
Let's hit the dance floor.

418
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
We can do that?

419
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,639
Of course!

420
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,600
We're just having fun.
What could possibly be wrong?

421
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,840
But I can't dance.

422
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,159
Just do what I do.

423
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,920
Prince Calvin, would you like to join us?

424
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,239
I think I'll pass.

425
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Paytai,

426
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
come dance with us.

427
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,440
Me?

428
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,199
- Yes.
- Me?

429
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,239
- Yeah.
- Are you talking to me?

430
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,239
Let's go!

431
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Your Royal Highness!

432
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,000
Your Royal Highness...

433
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
That must've been a blast, huh?

434
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,840
My apologies, Your Royal Highness.

435
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
I am truly remorseful.

436
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,040
Please command me

437
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
as you wish, Your Royal Highness.

438
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Any command?

439
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
For Your Royal Highness,

440
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,120
I am like a pet,

441
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,320
a devoted one,

442
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,440
ready to obey every command of yours.

443
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,680
Oh, my God.

444
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,000
Prince Calvin, come on.

445
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,880
Said he was going to the toilet
but ditched us.

446
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Hey,

447
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,960
I can walk.

448
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
- I barely drank anything.
- It's okay.

449
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,560
Charan...

450
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,320
There you are.

451
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Your Royal Highness,

452
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I humbly entrust Prince Khanin
to your care.

453
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,160
Charan...

454
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,920
It's okay.

455
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,320
Charan!

456
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,080
Hey...

457
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Charan!

458
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,280
Charan...

459
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,360
Charan...

460
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,440
Charan!

461
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,200
Hey!

462
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,130
Charan!

463
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,960
Charan...

464
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,240
Are you okay?

465
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,760
Are you hurt anywhere? Tell me.

466
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,360
I'm okay.

467
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Should we leave now?

468
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,400
Let's go.

469
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,200
Stay here with me.

470
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm right here,

471
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,320
right by your side.

472
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,760
Charan...

473
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,000
You've taken care of me so much.

474
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,720
Now, it's my turn to take care of you.

475
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,660
When I was six...

476
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,360
Mother...

477
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,120
Ran, take good care of yourself, okay?

478
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,680
And follow His Majesty's commands.

479
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,160
I'll have to be away for a while,

480
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,990
but I promise

481
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,330
I'll be back as soon as I can.

482
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Mr. Thatdanai is here.

483
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Mother!

484
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,280
Mother!

485
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,000
Please don't leave me.

486
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,640
Where are you going?

487
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,480
Mother!

488
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Mother...

489
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,160
She said she'd come back,

490
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,320
but she never did.

491
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,600
She didn't keep her promise.

492
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,200
Whenever it rains,

493
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,080
it terrifies me.

494
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,660
It's okay.

495
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,400
You don't have to talk now.

496
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,360
You should stay the night here.

497
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,020
I...

498
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,680
Please.

499
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,240
Why did you want me here?

500
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,800
You've saved me once again.

501
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,120
Who do you think did it?

502
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,560
A serious matter has arisen.

503
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,200
It is unacceptable
to take Khanin into such a location.

504
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,280
You can't dismiss him.

505
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
I do not consent to it.

506
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
You don't need to worry.

507
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,600
An excellent coach has been appointed.

508
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,960
I am Joe, Your Royal Highness.

509
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,960
There are plenty of coaches
in this country,

510
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,440
yet somehow only this one
happened to be available.

511
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,120
Please keep a close watch
over His Royal Highness.

512
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,240
You are allowed to cross the line.
