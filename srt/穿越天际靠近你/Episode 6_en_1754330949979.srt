1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
I will punish you!

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,840
Lip 24

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Finger以上

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,200
I want Rong to be my Coach,

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,360
so I can cheer you up.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,500
Brother.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,200
Let's go.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,380
Keep practicing, others will learn.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,120
tomorrow,

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
we must prepare ourselves

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,880
I will be the coach for your grandson.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm not a replacement.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,440
That's all I want.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,680
I just want you to be with me.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,120
From now on,

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,840
I will be your coach.

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,240
I have to play it for you like this now.

18
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Did you hear what I said?

19
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
The boy in black mania had to do so a lot lately.

20
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,520
He went to see the doctor all of a sudden.

21
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,640
When he saw his brother going to live with a man...

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,760
there was a man with money in his pocket.

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,840
I asked him about the spending of money since then.

24
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
He told me that he lost more thanEach month

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Please let us know.

26
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
It's alright.

27
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
What happened?

28
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
I was wrong.

29
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,080
I made a mistake and got a cramp in my ankle.

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,400
I'm now in the hospital.

31
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,120
I think you should take a break.

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

33
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,720
I have something to talk to you.

34
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
Where are we going?

35
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
To ride a roller-coaster.

36
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,320
outfit,

37
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
as a Kepler,

38
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,320
you were good at year 4.

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,840
However,

40
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:19,100
are you more

41
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,280
Lin Zhe 17 con Ben

42
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,760
Red

43
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,480
My lord

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,880
Go have a sit

45
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
I want to wash my hair.

47
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Wash your hair?

48
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Wait for me.

49
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
If you want to wash your hair,

51
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,840
you need to use Lolan Intense Care Treatment.

52
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,840
It will help your hair to be smooth and smooth.

53
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
It will be easy to wash in 7 seconds.

54
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Lolan.

55
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Yes.

56
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
The city of Minan is a very beautiful city.

58
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
The southern part of the country is emerald.

59
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,840
It's a tropical forest.

60
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
It's a place with a sea.

61
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
The main product is egg.

62
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Egg?

63
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Especially the egg with the world-class name.

64
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Egg?

65
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
It's beautiful.

66
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
But it's expensive, right?

67
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
The black-champagne egg is the most expensive.

68
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Is Minan far away from here?

69
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
It's closest to the Star-Castle.

70
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
And it's the second most popular product.

71
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
It's waiting for the Star-Castle.

72
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
Fahbad.

74
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I want to see the black-champagne egg with my own eyes.

75
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I think the treasure that...

76
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Not only the Star-Castle,

77
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
but also the Star-Castle.

78
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
I want to see the things that normal people can buy.

79
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
We still have time.

80
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
Actually,

81
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,840
we can go to Minan to see the real thing.

82
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
I think...

83
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
It's gone.

84
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
What?

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
It's gone.

86
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Take me there.

87
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
Please.

88
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
It's not far, right?

89
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,840
If I go out now,

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I think

91
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
I can only go to the egg-selling shop

92
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
at the back of the university.

93
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Okay, let's go.

94
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Chakri, we're going to the back of the university.

95
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
And Mr. Charan will take us there.

96
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,840
You don't have to go, okay?

97
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Chakri is okay.

98
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Chakri.

99
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Sir, please don't walk too fast.

100
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
If you walk too slowly,

101
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
you'll break up with me.

102
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
It's not suitable for you.

103
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Sir.

104
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
It's hot.

105
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
Here.

106
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Here.

107
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Thank you.

108
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Okay.

109
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
It's good.

110
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Thank you.

111
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
It's raining.

112
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Is it delicious?

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Try it.

114
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Here.

115
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,320
I can't tell the taste. How can it be compatible?

116
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,200
This dish used to be a dish

117
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,960
only for people who work like me.

118
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,120
They wanted high-energy food

119
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,560
and eat quickly.

120
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,800
So they mixed rice and sweet together

121
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
but because it tasted too strange,

122
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,920
they added spices.

123
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,360
You UI don't wait for me.

124
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
You pass the week to me.

125
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
It's not like that.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
Mr. Kanin.

127
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,000
How many suits you want?

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
One for his wife.

129
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
How about me?

130
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,960
You're great.

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,960
One for each of ours.

132
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,400
Waiter.

133
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,880
Okay.

134
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,760
1, 1, please.

135
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,880
Actually, the milk tea is a bit strange.

137
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,880
But it goes well with the roast pork.

138
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Would you like to try it?

139
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,480
I know you've tried it before.

140
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,840
But I want you to try it with me.

141
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
It's good, right?

142
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Here.

143
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Smile.

144
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,200
I don't think this is right.

145
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
Just a little.

146
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Smile.

147
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Smile.

148
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Smile.

149
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Smile.

150
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
That's all.

151
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
Let's go.

152
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,840
Please come in, Sir.

153
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
Please come in.

154
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,880
Do you sell

155
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,200
We should learn to especially value pleasure

156
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Have you made particular orders?

157
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
No

158
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,960
Su merely comes here to look for a secret inherited from His Majesty

159
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
Are you serious?

160
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,680
If His Majesty wants you to see it,

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,480
I will take you there

162
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,720
and that ends theuish of Ar개를's territory.

163
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,040
This is Celestion homework

164
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,560
of Celestial Evidence Brigade.

165
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,080
Your worksheet is beautiful.

166
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,440
There's only two of you

167
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,640
and your wife living here?

168
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,520
These Moreover complements

169
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
were built in Ivory Coast.

170
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,040
Celestial Evidence Brigade

171
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,120
is the favourite family put down by your mother.

172
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,200
I must be famousiner

173
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,000
You don't want to face others

174
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,280
because you're the leader of the army?

175
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,040
Yes.

176
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,440
The army's ability should not be exposed to the enemy.

177
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,640
This way, please.

178
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
Raise it up.

179
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,360
This is where I've spent the most time.

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
It's the painting studio.

181
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,720
If you hadn't told me about it, I might've thought it'd be by some printed gallery.

182
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
It doesn't look like

183
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,880
an old appartment in interviewed family feud.

184
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
All your drawings have been copied?

185
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,680
But some of them,

186
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,600
like this one,

187
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,200
are my mother's drawings.

188
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,840
Wow,

189
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,600
your family is so talented in drawing.

190
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,280
Not really.

191
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,960
But my favorite work is drawing.

192
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
Every time I draw,

193
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,120
I feel relaxed.

194
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
Then you should teach me how to draw.

195
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,040
Drawing is not suitable for...

196
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
I know.

197
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,320
But it's up to you to decide whether it's suitable for you or not.

198
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,360
If it's me,

199
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,120
I think it's good enough.

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Hey,

201
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,520
this is my personal place.

202
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm afraid it's not suitable for you.

203
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,200
You should go over there.

204
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,600
Why?

205
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Can't I stay in this room?

206
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,400
I want to see your drawings.

207
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
I can't help it.

208
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,000
Then wait for me.

209
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll be right back.

210
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,400
Okay.

211
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,640
Zhouave.

212
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,880
Really?

213
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,500
Thank you so much.

214
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,940
Cornflakes are a treasure from my mother.

215
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,580
My mom loved it.

216
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,420
And she's trying to onion for her son too.

217
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,720
It started from thepmr,

218
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,040
Take a look

219
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,500
Four имеx

220
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,680
Ai E

221
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
It's really beautiful.

222
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
My father ordered me to make this

223
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,640
and give it to you on the wedding day.

224
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
Your father is my romantic.

225
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Please excuse me.

226
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:25,440
An English man

227
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,120
I'll take care of it.

228
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,480
I think I'd rather go to see the students' school.

229
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,520
If you have a chance,

230
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,720
I'll take you there.

231
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,280
I won't kill you.

232
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,000
The nobody is even more important than Creatine.

233
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Lu poison,

234
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,240
huh?

235
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
Can you please bring in the investigation report

236
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,160
for us?

237
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,520
Is that because

238
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
you want to know

239
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,660
whether Kr

240
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,840
and Ai-chan

241
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
If they really date,

242
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,800
will you be sad?

243
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,960
There's no reason for me to be sad.

244
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,240
Because I'm the man of Mr.Ramin.

245
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,200
This person,

246
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,560
Enmy.

247
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,120
Really?

248
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,200
This person's name is even Dad.

249
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,080
Is your dad actually a man?

250
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm also a gentleman.

251
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,440
I followed his story,

252
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,600
even illusions from behind.

253
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
I love him.

254
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
I love him.

255
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,880
They didn't recognize me facebook crazy

256
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,440
As long as I called them, they didn't say anything

257
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
Even though I called it their way

258
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:57,440
Why is it that theyEuA

259
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,760
Cadet

260
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,280
You said you guy

261
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
with the life in the palace?

262
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm ready to start the check-up.

263
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
Good.

264
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,320
Today I brought you

265
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,280
the bird's nest to give you a chance to live.

266
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Do you want to try it?

267
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,280
No, I don't like it.

268
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Really?

269
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
No problem.

270
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,080
If you need anything,

271
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,280
just tell me.

272
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,480
I will do my best

273
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,920
to become as popular as classily as the

274
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,480
upper classes of the An Barkha emissions box.

275
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,640
Again.

276
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,560
Can you use your hand?

277
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,640
Please use your hand.

278
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
I want to go to the market.

279
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,760
I haven't bought much food yet.

280
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,720
I can't be like that.

281
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,320
Besides studying,

282
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
I have to practice sword fighting and shooting arrows.

283
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,920
Oh, right.

284
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,480
I just met the Prince of Wasin.

285
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,880
He told me that

286
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
the Asawat of the Gods

287
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,360
is like the sun of the universe.

288
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,920
It's strange.

289
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
It's strange.

290
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,280
The Prince of Wasin means

291
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,680
Meena Nakarin will never betray the Asawat of the Gods.

292
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,880
Even though he said he was on my side.

293
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,840
If the Asawat of the Gods

294
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
gets the title of the new queen,

295
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,240
Meena Nakarin will be the queen.

296
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
What's the use?

297
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,680
In the past,

298
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,640
when Meena Nakarin's egg was getting rare,

299
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,920
the Asawat of the Gods gave him the title of the new queen.

300
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,400
They gave him the title of the new queen

301
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,720
to increase the profit.

302
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
If the Prince of Tharin gets the title of the new queen,

303
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,520
Meena Nakarin will get the title of the new queen.

304
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
But the Prince of Wasin

305
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
who didn't give the title of the new queen,

306
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
it's just showing his respect

307
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
and showing his respect to the gods.

308
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,360
I dress up like a god.

309
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,440
Today, I'll nothing more than reform.

310
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,880
That's right, Master.

311
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,640
If I leave now, I can't stay alive.

312
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,760
Take this left hand.

313
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Are you looking at me?

314
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's try again.

315
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
I promise you

316
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I will follow your promise.

317
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Good night.

318
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I'll never forget your promise.

319
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
I will always remember it.

320
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
I will never forget it.

321
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
I promise you

322
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I will always remember it.

323
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I promise you

324
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
I will always remember it.

325
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I promise you

326
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
I will always remember it.

327
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
I promise you

328
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
I will always remember it.

329
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
Don't be sad.

330
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,160
Come with me.

331
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,760
Okay.

332
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,040
Here.

333
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Come on.

334
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
Follow me.

335
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:53,960
This one sounds good.

336
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,800
I think it'll fit..

337
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,400
Are you good?

338
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
This one should fly.

339
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,720
Just read and try it.

340
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,640
People need that much money too.

341
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
What a kid.

342
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,440
How much do we captain agree?

343
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,040
Er.

344
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,440
Do the people you've looked for find you?

345
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,840
Do I have to dress like this?

346
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,360
I'll take you to the party.

347
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,600
Are you going back to Thailand?

348
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,040
No, I don't think so.

349
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,560
I want to spend some time here.

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,240
That's good.

351
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,640
The toothbrush is out of order.

352
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,040
Sit down.

353
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm talking to the Prince of Khao Win.

354
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,560
I asked him to call you here

355
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,880
so I can talk to you now.

356
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

357
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,360
I saw that

358
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
your nephew and Prince of Khao Win

359
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,720
are the same age.

360
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
It would be good if you two are close.

361
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,480
I also want to take your nephew

362
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,400
to the temple

363
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,160
at the Thawit Maita.

364
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,240
The Thawit Maita?

365
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Yes.

366
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,400
There will be a temple

367
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,480
with the same name.

368
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Yes.

369
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,240
Please take care of Prince of Khao Win.

370
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,960
Why is the time so short, Sakri?

372
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,400
His Excellency the First Prince.

373
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,480
His Excellency the Second Prince.

374
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,600
Your Royal Highness the Queen

375
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,720
and His Excellency the King of Province.

376
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm pleased to have both of you

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,920

378

The Queen好orthono topple

380
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,040
I admire your support, Your Majesty.

381
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,120
Your Highness, you have a wish to stay outside.

382
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,880
Actually, it's more convenient here.

383
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

384
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:57,860
I'm not used to the

385
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,400
hair in your room.

386
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,940
If so,

387
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,500
please this way, please.

388
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,200
crying.

389
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,560
I hope to spread the message to the people.

390
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
It's ridiculous.

391
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,320
But I think

392
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,040
if the message can spread,

393
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
it will be good.

394
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
I'm free.

395
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,080
So I want to see your practice field.

396
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,160
I want to take you to see the field.

397
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,640
Why not?

398
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,480
Isn't this your field?

399
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,200
It's been a long time since I last tweeted.

400
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,040
Go viel with崔

401
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,560
The 2016 phenomena was released.

402
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm sorry.

403
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,560
I want to travel around the city.

404
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
I just searched it.

405
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,840
It's interesting.

406
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,560
Since I'm leaving the city,

407
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,360
I have to travel around the city.

408
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,320
Would you like to travel with me?

409
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,160
It's fun to travel with so many people.

410
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm sorry.

411
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
How can I take you to see the prince?

413
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,160
Then I'll book a hotel in the city for everyone.

414
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,960
You don't have to follow me.

415
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
What?

416
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,960
If my father knows that I'm here...

418
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Don't stress out.

419
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Just relax.

420
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
So we can have fun together.

421
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
What is it called?

422
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,360
It's called Twisher.

423
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
It's a cocktail from the city.

424
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
It's made of apple.

425
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,160
It's like an apple cider.

426
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,960
It's the key to my Twitter.

427
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Even though I don't drink it, it's still good.

428
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,160
Do you drink it sometimes?

429
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I don't like drinking.

430
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
I prefer drinking with drunk people.

431
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
You're so stubborn.

432
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,960
Try it. It's delicious.

433
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,960
It's not that bad.

434
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I'll try it.

435
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Sure.

436
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
You're here, Mr. Rammin.

437
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Have you seen my car?

438
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,960
No.

439
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Ying.

440
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
What?

441
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Let's dance.

442
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
It's good.

443
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
There's nothing wrong with having fun.

444
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I can't dance.

445
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Then follow me.

446
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Do you want to dance with me?

447
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
No.

448
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
P'Tay, let's dance.

449
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Well...

450
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Yes.

451
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Come on.

452
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Let's go.

453
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Let's go.

454
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
Let's go.

455
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Come on.

456
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm sorry.

457
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
I'm sorry.

458
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
I'm sorry.

459
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm sorry.

460
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm sorry.

461
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
I'm sorry.

462
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I'm sorry.

463
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm sorry.

465
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
I'm sorry.

466
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm sorry.

467
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
I'm sorry.

470
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
I'm sorry.

472
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
I'm sorry.

473
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I'm sorry.

474
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I'm sorry.

475
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm sorry.

476
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I'm sorry.

477
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
I'm sorry.

478
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm sorry.

479
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I'm sorry.

480
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm sorry.

481
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
I'm sorry.

482
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I'm sorry.

483
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I'm sorry.

484

I'm sorry.

485
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
I'm sorry.

486

I'm sorry.

487
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
I'm sorry.

488
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm sorry.

489
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm sorry.

490
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
I'm sorry.

492
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
I'm sorry.

493
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
I'm sorry.

494
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm sorry.

495
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
I'm sorry.

496
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
I'm sorry.

498
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm sorry.

499
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
I'm sorry.

501
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
I'm sorry.

502
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,960
I'm sorry.

503
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
I'm sorry.

504
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm sorry.

505
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,960
I'm sorry.

506
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
I'm sorry.

509
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
I'm sorry.

510
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I'm sorry.

512
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I'm sorry.

513
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,640
I'm sorry.

514
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Please go.

515
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
P' constant.

517
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
I'm sorry, Father.

518
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,840
I was wrong.

519
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,160
Please tell me

520
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,680
what I should do.

521
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Anything?

522
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,080
For me,

523
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm like a pet.

524
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,440
A pet that is willing to listen to

525
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,560
every word of my family.

526
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
But I can't be bathe it in water,

527
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,680
in dealing with sand Deringło and others.

528
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,200
Otherwise,

529
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,760
my heart will be taxed.

530
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,400
And,

531
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,040
I might not even be able to

532
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,720
prove it with tears.

533
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,960
Right now,

534
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,600
I am so happy

535
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,480
that I have been able

536
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,620
to reveal the truth

537
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,560
through this night.

538
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,840
Bun.

539
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,080
Oh my god.

540
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,440
Chest Kervin.

541
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
Woud specialty really go to the toilet and run away first?

542
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
Mister,

543
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,160
I can walk by myself.

544
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,400
I have been taking quite some time.

545
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,120
That's all right.

546
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
Mister Chalan.

547
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,140
Power of Men

548
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,200
Wait!

549
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,140
Are you okay?

550
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,420
Relax.

551
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,860
He's fine.

552
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,960
Let me treat you to this сред-wave tea.

553
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,320
What are you doing?

554
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,020
Don't stand up.

555
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Ouch!

556
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,020
How?

557
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,220
Stop.

558
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,340
Madam!

559
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,300
Madam!

560
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,460
Madam!

561
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,700
Madam!

562
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,020
Madam.

563
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,380
Let's go.

564
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,060
Come and belong to me, okay?

565
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,700
I'm right there.

566
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,140
I'm by your side.

567
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,820
I'm here.

568
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,380
What's wrong?

569
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,080
I...

570
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:32,840
You

571
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,340
from that day.

572
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,220
Can we just hear him out?

573
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,300
An Liv,

574
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,940
if you really Wants to be like Tryan,

575
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,900
feel free to take me by Marρά.

576
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,740
Mar cał concentration me!

577
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,220
We are even.

578
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,340
You are better than me.

579
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,380
You must be careful.

580
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
You must practice as per your command.

581
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
I have to go somewhere else for a while.

582
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,380
I promise you that I will be back soon.

583
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,380
When did you arrive?

584
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,380
Mom, mom.

585
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,380
Mom, don't go. Where are you going?

586
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,380
Mom, mom.

587
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,380
You said you would come back.

588
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,380
You didn't come back.

589
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,380
Why didn't you come back?

590
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,380
As promised.

591
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,380
I know.

592
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,380
The rain fell.

593
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,380
I'm scared.

594
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,380
It's okay.

595
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,380
You don't have to say anything.

596
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,380
Mom, I'm sorry.

597
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,380
I didn't sleep with you.

598
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,380
I...

599
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
Mom.

600
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,380
Mom.

601
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
Mom.

602
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,380
Mom.

603
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,380
Why did you call me?

604
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,380
You helped me again.

605
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,380
Who do you think is at fault?

606
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
Something big happened.

607
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Taking her to that place is not a good idea.

608
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,380
I can't let you win.

609
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,380
I won't let you win.

610
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,380
Don't worry.

611
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,380
I have a good coach for you.

612
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:14,380
I have a lot of coaches in this country.

613
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,380
I can teach you all.

614
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,380
I'm not afraid of you.

615
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,380
I'm not afraid of you.

616
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,380
I want to tell you something.

617
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:24,380
This last person can teach you alone.

618
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,380
Please take care of Mr. Kanin closely.

619
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,380
I can't do more than that.

620
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,380
I'm sorry.

621
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,380
I'll keep you alone.
