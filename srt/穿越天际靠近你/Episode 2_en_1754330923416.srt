Of course, I'm worried about your safety.

196
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,040
Would you like to sleep?

197
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Thank you.

198
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
I'll take a nap.

199
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
You hurt me.

200
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
You want to be in danger, don't you?

201
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I'm going to see my dad.

202
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
You can take yourself to them as you wish.

203
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I've been waiting for you.

204
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
You think you can help me?

205
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
This phone is not working.

206
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
And you didn't get permission to use it.

207
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I hope you understand

208
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
that your position must be kept as a secret.

209
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
I will work harder next time.

210
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
So I want you to beding with me,

211
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
and over trust.

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Promise me.

213
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
How?

214
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm not afraid of being threatened.

215
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
That can now be used to save your life.

216
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Hopefully your head is moved.

217
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
Then yes.

218
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
We'll be back.

219
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Your arm.

220
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,080
We have to invention them kind of

221
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,160
first, don't we?

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,080
Didn't you just say I matched the size of my notebooks.

223
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,880
Are you kidding?

224
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,880
10 JUSTICE

225
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm tired and I can't kitchen

226
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,640
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm sorry.

232
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
I'm sorry.

233
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I'm sorry.

234
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm sorry.

236
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
I'm sorry.

268
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,640
We're for assembly for the election of province democrats, isn't it?

270
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Yes.

271
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,440
Well, I'll start with events in Helsinki .

272
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,100
God of Death

273
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
The golden academic Will?

274
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,060
is in fucking great demand.

275
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,740
They have entire龍 Her buried in our waters.

276
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,740
It exactly how gold quality is not disobeyed or pushed down

277
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,900
I will try to fix it ourselves

278
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,940
Moreover,

279
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,780
The Dru Natura of 뜫e tea tree

280
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,100
is experiencing a Tacit war under the shadow of theuh

281
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,980
and Regular

282
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
This is just a small number.

283
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,980
We started selling it through the technology blockchain.

284
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,980
We got a number that was very satisfying.

285
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,980
As for Mina Nakarin,

286
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,980
we must thank the research fund from the Asawa Devadim

287
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,980
for making our dark-champion team

288
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,980
so unique and outstanding.

289
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,980
The Lord of the Rings is too kind.

290
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,980
The four cities and four tribes are not far away.

291
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,980
We must help them.

292
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Father,

293
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,980
call the royal physician from the royal palace.

294
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I'm fine.

295
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,980
We can't be worried and worried

296
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,980
if we don't see you often.

297
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
This is a small number.

298
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,980
We can't let the four cities

299
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
and four tribes to be in the dark

300
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
without your permission.

301
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,980
The number must be for the safety of all tribes.

302
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,980
We must prevent the accident

303
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
like what happened 22 years ago.

304
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
Father,

305
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,980
we're done.

306
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,980
Thank you for coming today.

307
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Father, what's wrong?

308
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,980
I have a secret.

309
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
Kanin is still alive.

310
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,980
Father, what did you say?

311
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,980
Kanin is still alive.

312
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I will take good care of our child.

313
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,980
You're serious.

314
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
You're just practicing.

315
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
What about your sister?

316
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Father, we're practicing.

317
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
But I can't give you a hand.

318
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Who is it?

319
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
I'm the one who's practicing.

320
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,980
The one who scores the most points first wins.

321
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Game on.

322
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Angad,

323
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,980
wait.

324
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Come on.

325
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
Cut.

326
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Cut.

327
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Good.

328
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Cut.

329
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Cut.

330
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
Cut.

331
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
The two of you are really good friends.

332
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Cut.

333
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
You're really close.

334
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Cut.

335
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,980
We've been playing together since we were little.

336
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Cut.

337
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
We're like real brothers.

338
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Cut.

339
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Cut.

340
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Cut.

341
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Cut.

342
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Cut.

343
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Cut.

344
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Your skill is still not enough.

345
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
You're really good.

346
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,980
You deserve to be the son of the King.

347
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't want the great King to be anything else.

348
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
I will not let the eighth prince

349
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,260
in the

350
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
whole world

351
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
down to earth

352
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,060
even if you are

353
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
News

354
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
this world

355
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,920
existem anymore.

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,520
What?

357
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,040
No one knows

358
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,960
what kind of presidential candidate

359
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,720
A-Ping has become.

360
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,280
But this is too new to say.

361
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,680
Soon,

362
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,480
I have already felt

363
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm not sure if I can do it.

364
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,780
I'm not sure if I can do it.

365
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

366
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

367
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

368
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

369
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

370
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

371
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

372
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

373
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

374
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

375
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

376
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

377
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

378
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

379
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

380
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

381
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,980
There's no competition in this competition.

382
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
Is that right?

383
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
But according to the tradition,

384
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
women can't compete.

385
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm not fair to my brother.

386
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,980
I'm the only descendant of the four families.

387
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Sir, Madam.

388
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Madam just said that Madam is busy.

389
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Please excuse us, Sir.

390
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Where are you going?

391
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,980
I'm following the tradition.

392
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Are you confused about your duty?

393
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
You should stay with us.

394
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I'm not alone.

395
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,980
Please let me go.

396
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
I'll see you later.

397
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
I'll see you later.

398
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
I'll see you later.

399
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
I'll see you later.

400
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
I'll see you later.

401
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
I'll see you later.

402
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,980
I'm going to back to my own country soon.

403
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Where will you go?

404
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I failed.

405
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,980
It's so bad.

406
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
See?

407
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
I have to change the plan

408
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,100
I'll reach you as soon as possible

409
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,340
I and mom have to go

410
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,220
Can you say something normal?

411
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,300
It's nothing. Please...

412
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,500
And...

413
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,660
I want to stay here.

414
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,260
I have to find my dad.

415
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
No.

416
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,780
It's too dangerous for you.

417
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,500
If Tatanai can survive,

418
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,860
the first place he'll go is Emily.

419
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,020
He knows you'll go there.

420
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,580
I don't know who hurt my dad.

421
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,380
You want me to leave?

422
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,700
If you want to know who hurt you and your dad,

423
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,420
you'll have to go to Emily.

424
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
Fine.

425
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,180
If my dad goes there,

426
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
I'll go.

427
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,020
The secret about the farm

428
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,620
is no longer different from the enemy's.

429
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,740
So it won't be easy to go to Emily.

430
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,620
I just received a message from Mr. Chalan

431
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,900
that for safety,

432
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,020
he's going to hunt the elephants

433
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
because the enemy knows about the plan

434
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,380
and is hunting them.

435
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm sorry.

436
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
What?

437
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,980
Actually, I wanted to join the business class,

438
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,860
but I'm afraid the fewer people, the more I'll die.

439
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,700
Why are you apologizing?

440
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
What's wrong with you?

441
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I can sit.

442
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,620
I'm an ordinary person.

443
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,820
I'm not a person who can sit.

444
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm just a normal person.

445
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,420
I'm just a normal person.

446
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm just a normal person.

447
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,620
I'm just a normal person.

448
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,860
I'm just a normal person.

449
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,260
It's not a big deal.

450
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,340
I like to sit in other people's seats.

451
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,820
Ms. Chen.

452
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,860
How are you?

453
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,420
Oh, you've only just gotten here

454
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,540
and you're staring atンタ an tailor.

455
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Please lead the way.

456
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
This is the time table.

457
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,660
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

458
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,240
Time table?

459
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,840
Is that so?

460
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,720
Where are you going all of a sudden?

461
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,080
Please fasten your seat belt and refrain from using the bathroom.

462
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
Son.

463
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,160
Bad joke.

464
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,640
Didn't you tell her not to come home?

465
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,040
Son.

466
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,920
What do you really want to ask me?

467
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,880
Be honest,

468
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
I'm afraid you know that

469
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
it's dangerous for you to come with me.

470
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Why do I still have to work?

471
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I have to work for you.

472
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
I'm the only one who can do it.

473
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
It's my duty.

474
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,880
No, it's not.

475
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I flew across the sky

476
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
and have the opportunity to bring the sky

477
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
back to Emily safely.

478
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
It's my duty.

479
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
Just like how you took care of me, right?

480
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
It's my duty.

481
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
If you're a good person,

482
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
you'll be able to take care of me.

483
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
I can't speak for you,

484
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
but I believe that

485
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
it's not just my duty.

486
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,880
It's because of what I've done.

487
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
It's a good thing.

488
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I'm glad that you're here.

489
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm so happy.

490
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Why do I have to follow the same path?

491
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
No matter what,

492
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
power is the winner.

493
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Do you need power?

494
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,880
Power is not important to me,

495
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
but it's the most important thing.

496
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,280
I'm sorry.

497
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
I have to get to go now.

498
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,880
What will futureatamente be for you up to now?

499
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
It'll be marvellous.

500
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Just say as usual.

501
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Okay.

502
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
When your dad arrives at Emily,

503
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
you'll meet her family...

504
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,440
How long will I stay?

505
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
To that point,

506
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,000
will you still be with me?

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,920
wine

508
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,120
Totley

509
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,520
Smell it.

510
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,000
Yes.

511
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,120
Please waiterv.

512
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,920
Tuck your finger in.

513
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
How are we going to cross to Emory?

514
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,360
I have a friend in Thailand.

515
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,560
He can help us.

516
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,120
Do you want to go to Thailand with me?

517
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
Thailand is near Emory.

518
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,760
The culture and language

519
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,240
are similar to Emory.

520
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,840
Why don't we go to Emory?

521
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,280
You miss that place, right?

522
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,560
I'm not ready to go back.

523
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,360
Then,

524
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,400
I think we can go to Thailand.

525
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,160
And I can speak Emory.

526
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,440
That means I can speak Thai.

527
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,840
My friend who is Thai

528
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,360
told me that

529
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm not good at Thai.

530
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,120
I'm better than many languages.

531
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,360
My friend told me that Thai food is delicious.

532
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,360
Have you tried it?

533
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,560
I thought you were just passing by.

534
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,960
Have you tried this before?

535
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,400
Papaya salad.

536
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,080
Oh, papaya salad.

537
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,360
My friend told me that it was delicious.

538
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,440
But I wonder why

539
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,880
there is no papaya salad in the papaya salad.

540
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,640
It's like...

541
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,080
Hey,

542
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,680
hey,

543
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,760
huh?

544
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,760
Are you okay?

545
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,160
I'm fine.

546
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't stay away from me.

547
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,760
Okay.

548
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,000
Here we go.

549
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
We bought ration for me.

550
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,080
We'll beaudience here.

551
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
But...

552
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,200
But...

553
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,240
I don't need to know what is what.

554
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,680
I don't want to be there.

555
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,600
So,

556
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,040
I already got it.

557
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,880
And then because this man

558
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,040
got me in the 하면

559
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
I'm leaving.

560
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,000
Why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going?

561
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I'm going to work here.

562
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,280
I see. You used to work in this condo.

563
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,920
Where have you been?

564
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,120
Japan.

565
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,440
I used to work there.

566
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,600
Ten years ago, I worked there.

567
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
I was very rich.

568
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,840
Well,

569
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,400
you two look like a good couple.

570
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,840
Are you two actors?

571
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
I don't want to talk to you.

572
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,640
Are you still together?

573
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,720
Well,

574
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,800
can you talk to me?

575
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,220
What's this?

576
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,840
How did this get here?

577
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Miss,

578
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,740
let's go!

579
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Don't hurry.

580
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Nice machine.

581
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,920
Hold on a sec.

582
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,080
About five minutes later,

583
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,880
you'll be too late to get here.

584
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm sorry.

585
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm sorry.

601
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm sorry.

603
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm sorry.

604
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
I'm sorry.

607
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
I'm sorry.

608
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I'm sorry.

610
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm sorry.

611
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm sorry.

612
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Get off.

614
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Get off.

615
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
What should we do?

616
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
They will follow us.

617
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Let's go inside.

618
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
This way.

619
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
You two, go that way.

620
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
Follow me.

621
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Hurry.

622
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
Get out.

623
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
Hurry.

624
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Hurry.

625
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Get up.

626
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Get up.

627
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Get up.

628
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Get up.

629
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Get up.

630
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Get up.

631
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Get up.

632
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Let's change the clothes.

633
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Let's go.

634
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
You don't know how to change clothes?

635
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Let me help you.

636
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,880
What's wrong?

637
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Give me your hand.

638
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,880
Okay.

639
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
You will feel uncomfortable.

640
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Take care of yourself first.

641
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm fine.

642
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Your wound...

643
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
I'm fine.

644
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
I think we should go.

645
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
What should we do next?

646
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
I've already told my friends where we are.

647
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
But they didn't come with you?

648
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Your phone is gone?

649
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
I just came to take a shower.

651
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
You're in someone else's room.

652
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
You're not allowed to enter.

653
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
I'll call the police.

654
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Brother.

655
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Do you think I'm a bad person

656
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
who caused trouble?

657
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
You're a bad person.

658
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
You're a bad person.

659
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
You're a bad person.

660
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
You're a bad person.

661
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
You're a bad person.

662
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
You're a bad person.

663
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
You're a bad person.

664
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
You're a bad person.

665
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
You look familiar.

666
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
You look like...

667
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Like who?

668
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Like a famous singer.

669
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Really?

670
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Thank you.

671
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,880
I'm really sorry.

672
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
I didn't ask for permission to enter the restaurant.

673
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,880
But I really came to avoid the rain.

674
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
It was raining heavily outside.

675
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
My friend also got hurt.

676
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,880
What happened?

677
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Macau New Beijing Entertainment Center

678
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,880

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,880
The most exciting PG game on the line.

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
Macau is going wild.

681
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Macau is going wild 2.

682
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
The queen of rewards.

683
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Search for the golden city.

684
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Recruit cat.

685
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
Reward captain.

686
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
High rate of compensation.

687
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
The reward frequency is high.

688
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
There are many opportunities to take revenge.

689
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
Hurry up and join.

690
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
Macau New Beijing Entertainment Center

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
891891.com

692
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I...

693
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
I'm not in a good mood.

694
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I also got hit by a phone.

695
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Can I borrow your phone?

696
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Can you call my friend?

697
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Please.

698
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
Please.

699
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Thank you.

700
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm sorry for my friend.

701
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm really sorry to bother you.

702
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
It's okay.

703
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Let's call it a day.

704
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Yes.

705
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,880
At first, I was really shocked.

706
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Thank you very much.

707
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Let's go.

708
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
What's up?

709
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
Nothing.

710
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
I haven't seen you for a long time.

711
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
I have something to tell you.

712
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Thank you.

713
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Here.

714
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Who is this?

715
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
This is my brother.

716
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
Your brother?

717
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
I'm not sure.

718
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
I don't know.

719
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
I don't know.

720
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Are you my brother?

721
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Are you really my brother?

722
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Why are you so angry?

723
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I'm just scolding you.

724
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Thank you for helping me and P'Ran.

725
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
You're welcome.

726
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Let's go.

727
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,880
Let's go.

728
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,880
Sit down.

729
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
My name is Wethith.

730
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm a friend of Run's.

731
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
We studied together.

732
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
What?

733
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
What?

734
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
This is not my brother, right?

735
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
P'Ran,

736
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
you have changed.

737
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Don't touch me.

738
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
This is my friend."

739
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
That person said me.

740
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,880
I think so.

741
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Your first order is also achieved.

742
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,040
I'm not sure.

743
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,640
Ang Ang is the cutest.

744
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,440
Has she been getting more attractive lately?

745
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,120
She's so attractive.

746
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,040
Wait.

747
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,160
She said Ang Ang...

748
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,480
Well,

749
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,240
her name is Fang.

750
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,400
She's from Angko.

751
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,080
She likes to be fierce like a girl.

752
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,920
Hey, Run.

753
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,320
What's your name?

754
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,240
It's the same as the name of Ang.

755
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,280
I like to call her...

756
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,080
Cute.

757
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,680
Cute.

758
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,800
Cute.

759
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,560
I don't think she likes to be called cute.

760
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,200
Stubborn.

761
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,280
Awesome.

762
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,680
She's cute,

763
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,480
but she's at the same level as Deng Nightingale.

764
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,320
Can we call her Duh Duh?

765
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,800
Duh Duh Ang Ang side.

766
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,480
Duh Duh Ang Ang.

767
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Duh Duh?

768
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,960
Ang Ang.

769
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,400
Please go ahead.

770
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,340
May we pay the heavy tweet?

771
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,460
Sure, you may use it.

772
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,600
Please call me if los glasses fit you.

773
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,720
Wu Mu!

774
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
Wu Mu!

775
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,720
Wu Mu!

776
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,720
Wu Mu!

777
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Wu Mu!

778
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,320
Wu Mu!

779
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,640
Wu Mu!

780
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,080
I didn't expect you could be so warm and considerate.

781
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,780
Let me talk with you.

782
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,580
Okay.

783
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,360
I'm sorry, sir.

784
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,480
I didn't mean to hurt you.

785
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,640
Don't call me that.

786
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,080
I'll keep it a secret in the hostel.

787
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,160
I can trust you.

788
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,400
But I just played a big role.

789
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,640
Why did you choose Kong?

790
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Enough.

791
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
Thank you, sir.

792
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,120
You're welcome.

793
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,280
What are you going to do tomorrow?

794
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,840
You'll be safe in the train.

795
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,880
I'll be there for you.

796
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,480
Don't worry.

797
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,040
I have a plan.

798
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Hello.

799
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
What can I do for you?

800
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,040
Have you seen this man?

801
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
He just asked me for directions.

802
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,480
That's him, right?

803
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
Run.

804
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,880
Let's go.

805
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,840
What do you think of my plan?

806
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
Really?

807
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,000
Are you chilling?

808
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:16,900
Are you sure you're

809
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,440
not joking with yourself?

810
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,400
I'm not joking.

811
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,680
They are in Chunchara.

812
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,040
I'll be there in a few minutes.

813
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,480
You must wait for my good news.

814
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
See you there.

815
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,220
The Boss

816
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,960
Why did you have to understand?

817
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,560
Who said you have to know your boss?

818
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,680
I will tell you.

819
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,880
He lives under the exact same floor and such a simple breakfast,

820
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,160
no earlier now he lived there,

821
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,780
this...

822
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,420
It's okay.

823
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,920
We don't have a Такetak Kamisato.

824
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,520
10!

825
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,080
Yes!

826
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,680
Is it dangerous to shake it?

827
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,040
Have a permanent feel.

828
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,920
Whip it to get healthy.

829
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,360
I want to lift it.

830
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,720
Want to try?

831
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,760
Okay, let's do it.

832
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,640
they wouldn't fight to use their power.

833
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,680
It'll be better

834
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:41,440
if they give him some

835
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,680
cash,

836
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:45,640
no,

837
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:47,360
nothin' like that.

838
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,520
Fine.

839
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,320
I can't just sit back and watch.

840
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,360
I think you were quite smooth when I teased you.

841
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,040
I believe you.

842
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,600
You two seem to be interested in each other.

843
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,680
Hey,

844
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,440
stop playing around.

845
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,280
Fine, I won't play around.

846
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,120
Yes, please.

847
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,880
I'm so grateful that you took care of me.

848
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,280
That's why I'm able to remove these.

849
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,080
We'll change our clothes when we arrive.

850
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,640
Father.

851
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,640
Yes?

852
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,320
I have to go back to Asawatebatiang this evening.

853
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,440
Go ahead.

854
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,680
I'll be back soon.

855
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,440
In order to help Asawate빛batiang return to his home country,

856
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,400
I'll take over that ancient kingdom.

857
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,520
When will you take over?

858
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,840
I'll announce to the world

859
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,760
that the new beginning of our brothers' yellы

860
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,440
isодing its new Gen 정말chik.

861
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,440
But I just returned from the battle.

862
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,160
Since you tell me

863
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,320
that the once- Matrix Kingdom was made a safety zone for them,

864
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,360
how much of a threat

865
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,720
do you see it as compared to the family

866
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,560
that складed it for you?

867
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,960
are not your people.

868
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,480
Your Majesty.

869
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,560
Is it possible, then?

870
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,880
This concubine

871
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,000
has such an unlicensed father.

872
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,760
Is there no use

873
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,560
for her to see Suifully?

874
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,320
Prince Chen,

875
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,360
did Prince Chen

876
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,560
announce that

877
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,800
work for

878
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,800
the job for Fushan

879
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,800
has been rescheduled,

880
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,960
but his antics

881
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,960
I dare to let my nephew come back to risk.

882
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
Because I know with all my heart that I can't

883
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,960
trust anyone to take care of the people of Emmerich as well as you.

884
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,960
For Emmerich, I will be the next King.

885
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,960
Emmerich

886
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,960
I'm Khanin, the god of the gods.

887
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,960
I heard that you are very happy today.

888
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,960
But how do you know that this person is the real blood of the gods?

889
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,960
I'm sure that you will be the king of Emmerich.

890
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,380
One person left, but he came back with a

891
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,960
gift. The other person is a woman.

892
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
I want to see the sky fall into the ice.

893
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Will you accept my decision?

894
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,960
This is my nephew, Khanin, the god of the gods.

895
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,960
How far is the end of heaven?

896
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,960
How long does this love last?

897
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,960
The wind blows the sky and I'm ready to go.

898
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I want to see you.

899
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,960
Let the stars shine on our relationship.

900
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,960
Let love be the end of you and me.

901
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Can you love me and trust me?

902
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Remember my hand.

903
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,960
There is still love in the sky.

904
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Emmerich
