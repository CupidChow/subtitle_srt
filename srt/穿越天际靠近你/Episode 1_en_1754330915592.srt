The living god has sent a message to the king to order you to guard for half an hour.

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I understand.

Goodness!

20
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
I'm a trainee.

21
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,140
You must be wondering that I'm a test-taker, right?

22
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,140
I believe that you have a personal reason, Your Majesty.

23
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,140
I see the miracle is waiting for me.

24
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
The sun will soon be coming.

25
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,140
If someone knows about it,

26
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,140
it would be good to have a tea together.

27
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Oh, I've said it many times.

28
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,140
When you're together, you don't have to talk about the king.

29
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
You're my grandchild.

30
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,140
Get up.

31
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

32
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Let's sit down.

33
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140
Sit.

34
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Sit.

35
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,140
I have only one grandchild, Charan, who can talk comfortably.

36
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,140
How is my grandfather now?

37
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,140
He's been sick and tired.

38
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,140
But now I'm lonely, so I called you to join me for tea.

39
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
What kind of tea do you want to drink today?

40
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
Chamomile tea or oolong tea?

41
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Chamomile tea.

42
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
I'm tired of these two teas.

43
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
I know there's something better.

44
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I want you to try your own tea.

45
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
It's a tea that comes from England.

46
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:49,140
The taste of the tea makes me feel like I've been in the past.

47
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,140
But now I'm too old to buy it myself.

48
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,140
I can't trust anyone who helps me buy it.

49
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,140
If you trust me, I'll bring it to you.

50
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,140
Then hurry up.

51
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
I have only one grandchild.

52
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
Go to my old friend, Tat.

53
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,140
He'll prepare the best tea for you.

54
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,140
I'll leave it to you.

55
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,140
If it's too late, it won't work.

56
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Please accept my gratitude.

57
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140

My bus has stopped!

115
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
That's just looking forward!

116
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Yeah, I want the image.

117
00:12:34,240 --> 00:13:01,440
Congratulations to the winner of Group A, Keneth.

118
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I have heard that Keneth is of Himalayan descent.

119
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
He is one of the best fencing countries in the world.

120
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,440
He is also the best in his University of East Fencing Club.

121
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
It's no surprise he won.

122
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Please give Keneth the support in the finals.

123
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Keneth is the best fencer in the world.

124
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
He is the best fencer in the world.

125
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
He is the best fencer in the world.

126
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,440
He is the best fencer in the world.

127

133
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm just messing around, mate.

134
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
By the way, congratulations.

135
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Congratulations.

136
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Congratulations.

137
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Hey.

138
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Why are you following me?

139
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Are you a scout?

140
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
What?

141
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Why don't you answer my question?

142
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
What do you want?

143
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Why?

144
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
I can't hear you.

145
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I think you're a scout.

146
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I'm not a scout.

147
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm a scout.

148
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm a scout.

149
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Tell me.

150
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
I don't think I'm here to see you.

151
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Oh.

152
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Are you here to flirt with me?

153
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Oh, you.

154
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,440
No one ever told you that if you flirt with someone,

155
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
it's scary to follow someone else.

156
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
And I don't care about people like you.

157
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
It's time.

158
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm sorry.

159
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Don't think too much.

160
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Hey.

161
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
You said…

162
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,440
No one told you that when you flirt,

163
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
you usually move your body first.

164
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Do you know that being used to it

165
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
can make you a loser?

166
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Is this the best thing about the Funtime Club?

167
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
I think you're still a rookie.

168
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Who am I?

169
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
I think people know me very well.

170
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
You're still too hot-tempered

171
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
besides moving your body first.

172
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I warn you with good intentions.

173
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
But if you're still like this,

174
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
you can't be a champion.

175
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Here.

177
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
You're just in time.

178
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Sit down.

179
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Do you know that

180
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,440
I'm in the real world today?

181
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Really?

182
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm glad.

183
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
But don't be too excited.

184
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
For Emily…

185
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
For Emily,

186
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I'm not strong enough to be a pro athlete.

187
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Whatever it is, it's Emily.

188
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Food is Emily.

189
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
This house is decorated like Emily.

190
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm not going to name it Emily.

191
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
It's good that you know.

192
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Eat up.

193
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
After you finish eating, you can go to practice with me.

194
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Dad, you're not going to let me rest?

195
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Kaneen.

196
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Yes?

197
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Don't forget the etiquette as a food.

198
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I know.

199
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
I'm not going to play around.

200
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I just want to have fun.

201
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
If I'm not a writer,

202
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm sure I'm a soldier.

203
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I'm sorry.

204
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
When you're out,

205
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
you usually move your body first.

206
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm sorry.

207
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Is this the best place in the club?

208
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
You seem to be out of breath.

209
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Is there anything wrong?

210
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I…

211
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Nothing, Dad.

212
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Let me see.

213
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Calm down.

214
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Focus on breathing.

215
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
Breathe in and out.

216
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Breathe in.

217
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Breathe in.

218
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Yes.

219
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
That's great.

220
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm glad that you know your own flaws

221
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
and fix them by yourself.

222
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
It's really better?

223
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Your problem is

224
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,440
you move your body too much and tense up.

225
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,440
I know that you're trying to fix it.

226
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Try again.

227
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Don't be tense.

228
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Breathe in deeply and focus.

229
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Good.

230
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Great.

231
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Yes.

232
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Yes.

233
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Yes.

234
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Ali.

235
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Yes.

236
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
I'm glad.

237
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm glad.

238
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Ali.

239
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Yes.

240
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Yes.

241
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Yes.

242
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Yes.

243
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Yes.

244
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Kenneth, you're the first Mali's I've ever faced.

245
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Congratulations.

246
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Thank you for the match.

247
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
May I ask you, who taught you fencing?

248
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
It's my dad.

249
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Thank you.

250
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Surprise.

251
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
How did you get in my house?

253
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I don't know.

254
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I'll take care of it.

255
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Ming, you're smart.

256
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
He'll be with us for a while.

257
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Smart?

258
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
He's the nephew that I respect.

259
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
I don't understand.

260
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
You said you'd take care of it.

261
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
What did you do?

262
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
Why did he have to be with us?

263
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't be afraid to be a good housewife.

264
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Kenneth.

265
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
I'm sorry.

266
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Don't be afraid.

267
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Don't worry.

268
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Where are you going?

269
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Why did you come down?

270
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Can't I come down?

271
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
I'm here to talk about you.

272
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
I'm just not used to it.

273
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Normally, no one is so strange in the house.

274
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Why do you have to be here?

275
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Ask your dad.

276
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm asking you.

277
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm asking you.

278
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Do you have a place to stay?

279
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Yes, but I have to stay here.

280
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
You have to stay here.

281
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Why?

282
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Your dad knows everything you want to know.

283
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Ask him.

284
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Dad.

285
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Dad.

286
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
You got a champ.

287
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Good job.

288
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Thank you, dad.

289
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
I intended to ask you out yesterday,

290
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
but it happened first.

291
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Wait here.

292
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Did you cook for him?

293
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
No.

294
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm going to practice now.

295
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
I don't want to see anyone.

296
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Dean.

297
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,440
I'll have some samosa with your dad.

298
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
I have to go.

299
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm going to practice now.

300
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
What are you doing?

301
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I got you.

302
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Oh my God, Paul.

303
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
What's going on, mate?

304
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
You've been so jumpy lately.

305
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Yes.

307
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Who are you?

308
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Sir?

309
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm Kenneth's friend.

310
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
What?

311
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Nice to meet you.

312
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Hi.

313
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I heard your friend invited you to a party.

314
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
That's my business.

315
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm going with you.

316
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
That's funny.

317
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Why do you have to go?

318
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm going with you.

319
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Why do you have to go?

320
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
I heard you're having a party.

321
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Celebrating Kenneth Swinbride.

322
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh, yeah.

323
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Can I come?

324
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Well,

325
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
yes, my man.

326
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
You know what?

327
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Tomorrow the merry-go-round.

328
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
I think.

329
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,440
So, what's your name, sir?

330
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Saran.

331
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Sher...

332
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Sherang.

333
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Sherang.

334
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Right.

335
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Let's join us.

336
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Let's go.

337
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Let's go.

338
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Why not?

339
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Come on, boy.

340
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
That's a great idea.

341
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
You like it?

342
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Don't you?

343
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
No?

344
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Hi, guys.

345
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
My cousin brought Taokanoy seaweed snacks from Thailand for you all.

346
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
So, enjoy.

347
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Thank you.

348
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Cheers.

349
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Are you having fun?

350
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
It's okay.

351
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Good.

352
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Cheers.

353
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
So what?

354
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
The winner.

355
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
The winner.

356
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Hi.

357
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
This is for you.

358
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Thanks.

359
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Are you guys enjoying?

360
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
How's it going?

361
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
It's doing great.

362
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Good?

363
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
You know, I'm a bit tipsy now.

364
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Hi.

365
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Oh, hey.

366
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,440
So, you said you were friends of Kenneth, am I right?

367
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
You can say that.

368
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Okay.

369
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
You never told me you had a hot friend, Kenneth.

370
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Here's your tie.

371
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
I think you can touch something.

372
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I want to eat it.

373
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
It's good.

374
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Come on.

375
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Guys, cheers.

376
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Cheers.

377
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Cheers.

378
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
Come on, cheers.

379
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Cheers.

380
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Yeah, drink.

381
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Come on, you're such a heavyweight.

382
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
You drink a lot.

383
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
No, I'm not.

384
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
I just know when to stop.

385
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Okay.

386
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
It's good, right?

387
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
It's easy to get in with someone like this.

388
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
I'm not a person who can get in easily.

389
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Come on, guys.

390
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
What are you guys talking about?

391
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Hey, hey, hey.

392
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Hey, boy.

393
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Should we go inside?

394
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Exactly.

395
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
That's a great idea.

396
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Let's get inside.

397
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
That's a perfect idea.

398
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Yeah.

399
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
I don't want to eat it.

400
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Let's play a game.

401
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
A game?

402
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Yeah, what game should we play?

403
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Do you want to play anything?

404
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Any idea?

405
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,440
I think we should play the Pocky game.

406
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
The Pocky game?

407
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
That's a great idea.

408
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Come on, man.

409
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
You play with us.

410
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Kenneth, you go in.

411
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
No, I'm not playing that.

412
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Come on.

413
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Come on, man.

414
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
We are here to celebrate your win.

415
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
So you must play.

416
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,440
There's no choice for you.

417
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
And Shafran, join us too.

418
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
Come on.

419
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
No.

420
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Come on, man.

421
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Don't be mean to him.

422
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
He's our new friend.

423
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,440
Yeah, let's spin it for a pair.

424
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Yeah, that's good.

425
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
You go first.

426
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Thank you.

427
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
Okay, let's go.

428
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,440
No.

429
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Come on, man.

430
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Why?

431
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Don't look at me like that.

432
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
I do not want to play with you.

433
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Do you think I want to do this?

434
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Come on.

435
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
The prize has to be you.

436
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Your turn.

437
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
You got to do this.

438
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Oh, Kenneth.

439
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
That's a good one.

440
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Wow.

441
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
That's crazy.

442
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
All right.

443
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Okay, I'll be your referee.

444
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
So the rule is very simple.

445
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,440
You make your Pocky as short as possible

446
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
and the pair with the shortest piece win.

447
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
And the losers must drink.

448
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Right?

449
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
I was about to lose.

450
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
If you don't dare, just get out.

451
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Why do I have to get out?

452
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,440
We have the same goal.

453
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Ready?

454
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
Are you sure?

455
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Right.

456
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Let's do it.

457
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
Ready?

458
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
It's not hard.

459
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,440
3, 2, 1.

460
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Go.

461
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Go, go, go, go.

462
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Yes.

463
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Close up.

464
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
Yes.

465
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Close up.

466
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
You got it.

467
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Close up.

468
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Yeah.

469
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Go.

470
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
Close up.

471
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Yeah.

472
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Close up.

473
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Yeah.

474
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Yeah.

475
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Yeah.

476
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Yeah.

477
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Yep.

478
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Who's going to win?

479
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
Come on, man.

480
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Close up.

481
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Yeah.

482
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Who's going to win?

483
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
You want to win?

484
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
This is good.

485
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
This is good.

486
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Let me see.

487
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Show me.

488
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Show me.

489
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
This is good.

490
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Show me the result.

491
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Shake it.

492
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
I was just waiting for you.

493
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Yeah.

494
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
Show me the piece.

495
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
It is very obvious.

496
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,440
The winner are Kinesh and Sherin.

497
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Woo.

498
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Woo.

499
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Oh, no.

500
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Oh, no.

501
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Oh, no.

502
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
Oh, no.

503
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Oh, no.

504
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Oh, no.

505
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Oh, no.

506
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Oh, no.

507
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Oh, no.

508
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Come on, man.

509
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Where's Sherin?

510
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Come on.

511
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Oh, no.

512
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
OK.

513
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Hey,

514
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
what's wrong?

515
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
You want to know more about that boogie game?

516
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
It's real.

517
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
I don't want to know.

518
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm going home to pack.

519
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Good night.

520
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Rin.

521
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
You're still up?

522
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Why are you home so late?

523
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
I went to celebrate with my parents.

524
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
They already sent me a message.

525
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
I'm worried about you.

526
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
It's good that you're home.

527
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Go and have a rest.

528
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Rin.

529
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Dad,

530
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
I want to know about

531
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
the kiss of Mali's ex.

532
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Why do you want to know about this?

533
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,440
I just want to know.

534
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Normally, you tell me everything about Mali.

535
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Why don't you tell me about this?

536
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
I don't want to tell you.

537
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
But I don't think it's necessary.

538
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Why not?

539
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I mean

540
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,440
I already know everything about Mali.

541
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
The kiss of Mali.

542
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
If Mali kisses someone,

543
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
it's a love promise with that person

544
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
until death do us part.

545
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Tee,

546
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,440
why did you just play the game?

547
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
The game?

548
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Don't be so serious.

549
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Game?

550
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
What game did you and Charan play?

551
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Nothing.

552
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm going to bed.

553
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Good night.

554
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Wait.

555
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
I'm glad

556
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
that you care about Mali.

557
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm sorry.

558
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm sorry.

559
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
If Mali kisses someone,

560
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
it's a love promise with that person

561
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
until death do us part.

562
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm sorry.

563
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Is this just a story?

564
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
Is it really?

565
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
If you want to know more about the story,

566
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
please go to

567
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
www.aomansinghupajing.com

568
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
and click on the bell icon.

569
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
That's it.

570
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I don't think we need to talk about it.

571
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
We can talk about it.

572
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
One more thing.

573
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I think it's been leaked.

574
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
So we need to take the boss and Mali

575
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
as soon as possible for safety.

576
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
It's been leaked?

577
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
The boss Kha-Nin

578
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
needs to know that you have a blood test.

579
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
I created that story.

580
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
I'm glad

581
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,440
that you like it.

582
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
But he's not ready to compete yet.

583
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
The situation of your life

584
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
is getting worse

585
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
according to the old ritual of Mali.

586
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
If you surrender,

587
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
you must take care of this race

588
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
and the boss must go back

589
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
as the only heir of the angelic dynasty.

590
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I don't know what to tell him.

591
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Because all this time,

592
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
I feel like he's my real son.

593
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Nin,

594
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I'm sorry.

595
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm sorry.

596
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I'm sorry.

597
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Who can tell me what the hell is going on?

598
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Boss Kha-Nin,

599
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
I have a blood test.

600
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
And I have to go back to the M.I.

601
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
What are you talking about?

602
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
Dad,

603
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
what are you talking about?

604
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm sorry.

605
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Dad, dad.

606
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,440
You are the boss Kha-Nin.

607
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,440
And I

608
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
am not your real father.

609
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,440
I don't believe you.

610
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
I'm sorry for being wrong all the time.

611
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
It's not true.

612
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
It's time

613
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
for you to go back to Mali.

614
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Dad, dad, don't.

615
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
Dad, don't.

616
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
Don't lie to me.

618
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Don't be like this.

619
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Dad, dad.

620
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,440
What's wrong with you?

621
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Answer me.

622
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I'm sorry.

623
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm sorry.

624
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm sorry.

625
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
I don't believe it.

626
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Why did you become a crazy boss?

627
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
I'm sorry.

628
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
I'm not your real father.

629
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Can I be your father?

630
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Can I be your father?

631
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Dad, dad, don't.

632
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,440
Dad.

633
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
I'm sorry.

634
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
I'm sorry.

635
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm sorry.

636
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,440
I'm sorry.

637
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,440
I'm sorry.

638
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,440
I'm sorry.

639
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
I'm sorry.

640
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
I'm sorry.

641
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
I'm sorry.

642
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
I'm sorry.

643
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
I'm sorry.

644
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,440
I'm sorry.

645
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
I'm sorry.

646
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
I'm sorry.

647
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
I'm sorry.

648
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
I'm sorry.

649
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,440
Myppy is wrong.

650
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
You're fine.

651
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
superficially.

652
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Just learn it slowly.

653
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,940
Here you go.

654
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,080
He's so good.

655
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,600
Everything is what it is.

656
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,080
He's good at playing.

657
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,120
Music.

658
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,560
What should I tell her?

659
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Because all this time,

660
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,440
I felt like Phuphaen was my real son.

661
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
I'm sorry.

662
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,440
How did you get in?

663
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
Out.

664
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,440
My duty is to take care and protect the temple.

665
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Take care?

666
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,440
But right now, you're ruining my life.

667
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,440
Take it easy, my son.

668
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,440
Calm down.

669
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Control your badass step, my son.

670
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Ok, it's good.

671
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
Use your teeth.

672
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,440
Yeah.

673
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Hey, you cheated.

674
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Yay, I won.

675
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,440
You really didn't cheat?

676
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Did you win?

677
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
I won.

678
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
I lost.

679
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,440
I'm not good at this.

680
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
I'm sorry.

681
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,440
It's okay.

682
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,440
I'm sorry.

683
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,440
I'm sorry.

684
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Dad,

685
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,440
please explain about the collection to me.

686
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,440
I'm sorry.

687
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Fahbad is the only descendant of the Asawakthewatit family.

688
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,440
The Asawakthewatit family,

689
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:54,440
whose eldest son is the king of the Mali kingdom,

690
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
when the king was less than one year old,

691
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,440
an unexpected thing happened.

692
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
The death of Queen Khunita,

693
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
the daughter of Fahbad,

694
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,440
caused the death of the king.

695
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,440
The king ordered the king and the queen to go to the temple

696
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,440
where the two princes were having a funeral.

697
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,440
But the truth was unknown.

698
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,440
The king sent his army to help Fahbad.

699
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,440
And he ordered Fahbad to flee abroad with the army.

700
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
And now,

701
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:55,440
it's time for the king to go back to his real family.

702
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,440
Meen,

703
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
are you asleep?

704
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,440
I want to talk to you.

705
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
I'm sorry.

706
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,440
I'm sorry.

707
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
I'm sorry.

708
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,440
I'm sorry.

709
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,440
I'm sorry.

710
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,440
I'm sorry.

711
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,440
I'm sorry.

712
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,440
I'm sorry.

713
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
I'm sorry.

714
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
I'm sorry.

715
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
I'm sorry.

716
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
I'm sorry.

717
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
I'm sorry.

718
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,440
I'm sorry.

719
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,440
I'm sorry.

720
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,440
In the past,

721
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,440
you've never seen a child, have you?

722
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,440
No.

723
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Never.

724
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,440
Meen,

725
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,440
are you going to see Emily?

726
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
I'm sorry.

727
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
I'm sorry.

728
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
I'm sorry.

729
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
I'm sorry.

730
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,440
I'm sorry.

731
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
I'm sorry.

732
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
I'm sorry.

733
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
I'm sorry.

734
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
I'm sorry.

735
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
I'm sorry.

736
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
I'm sorry.

737
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
I'm sorry.

738
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
I'm sorry.

739
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,440
I'm sorry.

740
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
I'm sorry.

741
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
I'm sorry.

742
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
I'm sorry.

743
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
I'm sorry.

744
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
They already know that you're here.

745
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,440
What?

746
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,440
We have to hurry.

747
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Hurry?

748
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,440
If he doesn't go, he has no choice.

749
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,440
Why do I have no choice? This is my life.

750
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
What's wrong with you?

751
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,440
I'm sorry.

752
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,440
Get out of the way.

753
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,440
Hurry up.

754
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,440
Get out of the way.

755
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Get out of the way.

756
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,440
Let go.

757
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Let go.

758
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Get out of the way.

759
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,440
Let go.

760
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,440
You want your father to be killed, right?

761
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,440
I'm going to see my father.

762
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,440
You can take yourself to the south.

763
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,440
If you don't trust me, at least trust your father.

764
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
How are we going to go to Mali?

765
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
