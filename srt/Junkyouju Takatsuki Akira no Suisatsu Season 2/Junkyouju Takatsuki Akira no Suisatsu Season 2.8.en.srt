1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:03,084
(Kenji): Kinoshita Shunya kun, used to abuse by his parents 

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:07,088
It seems that they were good friends and he died just at the age of 12.

3
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:10,091
Terauchi: It's all right, no one's gonna hit you here.

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:14,095
(Takatsuki): Terauchi is trying to help Chisato-chan in replace of Shunya-kun.

5
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,097
(Kousuke): If the remaining bad bruises...

6
00:00:16,097 --> 00:00:18,099
 are notified and informed to the police they'll find out

7
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,102
You can fly freely. If I will do so..

8
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:23,104
Terauchi may have been saved.

9
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:27,108
You have to follow your missions as a tengu.

10
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:32,113
You have a mission. You're not just a human.

11
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:34,115
See you again.

12
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:38,119
(Naoya): Even if the Professor is taken to anywhere..

13
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,121
I…

14
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:44,125
I will stop it! Absolutely!

15
00:00:44,125 --> 00:01:04,078
♬～

16
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:14,088
♬～

17
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:18,092
Do you think you can stop it? seriously?

18
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:24,098
What are you going to do with Professor Takatsuki?

19
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:29,103
(Crow barks)

20
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:34,103
 Aren't you scared of birds?

21
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:40,114
I consider winged creatures as my friends.

22
00:01:40,114 --> 00:01:45,114
Is it related to tengu?

23
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:53,121
Do you remember it? What happened?

24
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:57,128
Even more than your Sensei...

25
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:03,133
What happened? I'll go if you don't answer.

26
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:10,072
I also wanted to be spirited away...

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,080
When I got to understand lies, everybody started to find me as creepy. 

28
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:25,087
I didn't have a place at school or at home.

29
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:32,099
I think what you are doing is helping someone.

30
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,099
But why are you inviting the Professor?

31
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:46,108
Are you lonely too?

32
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:51,115
["That's not true"]

33
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:02,124
I know you're lying.

34
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:11,065
I have friends. You don't have to worry about that.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,080
(Ruiko): Please bring this talisman instead of me.

36
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,090
Is it a plum knot?

37
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:39,099
Meaning it's a good luck charm and  strong bond...

38
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,099
And amulet

39
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:50,107
Sensei.

40
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,113
take care

41
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:59,116
Thank you

Huh ... is it here?

45
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:05,052
(Namiko): Welcome (Nakai and others) Welcome

46
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:07,054
(Namiko) Mr. Takatsuki we've been waiting for you.

47
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:10,057
Thanks

48
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:14,057
(Nakai) Thank you for your luggage.

49
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,066
That lady you just before,

50
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:22,069
She warned me that I should not enter the pond.

51
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:28,069
But I may have broken the taboo and met the lord of the mountains.

52
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:31,078
(Kenji) How's that exactly?

53
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:35,082
If you were told not to enter when you were a kid 

54
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:38,085
were you that type who would obey quietly?

55
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:42,085
Certainly that is also the case

56
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:51,098
Did you go to my parents' house the other day?

57
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:53,100
Ah yes.

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,103
My father's secretary has informed me

59
00:05:56,103 --> 00:06:00,107
You were screaming, "Don't force the Professor as a tengu, if you do I'll stop it."

60
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:05,045
Ah ... I'll feel distressed if my teacher is forced to be a tengu-sama.

61
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:10,045
If you do that again, Terauchi may come to your place again.

62
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:16,051
Fukamachi is kind and reliable

63
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:38,078
Terauchi is actually lonely.

64
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:42,082
He said "I have friends".

65
00:06:42,082 --> 00:06:47,082
I think he wants to be accepted by you.

66
00:06:48,088 --> 00:06:51,091
hang on

67
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:54,094
Did you say that Terauchi has friends?

68
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:57,097
Yes it is

71
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:28,062
I have printed out the photo sent by Toyama-san.

72
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,064
Alright

73
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:33,067
Chisato-chan before getting on the bus

74
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:37,067
The man next to her was this person.

75
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:43,072
This person in the bus is this man

76
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:48,082
A woman walking beside Chisato

77
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:50,084
It's Koharu Kurimoto

78
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,084
It's true

79
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,091
He created an.... "organization."

80
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:59,091
An organization?

81
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:05,032
Briefly...

82
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:10,032
It ’s a group with the same purpose.

83
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,041
Visiting pilgrimage during the Edo period...

84
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,043
The pilgrims couldn't afford to visit Mt. Fuji because...

85
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:20,047
Those without financial strength could not fulfill their dreams.

86
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:23,050
That's why they would all share money and rice and give it to one person...

87
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,053
Then they would send that one person as their representative to worship.

88
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:28,055
Only the representative?

89
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:30,057
In replace of everyone, the representative 

90
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:35,062
will worship to fulfill the wishes of everyone who sent him there.

91
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:41,068
Did Terauchi also make a group to carry out the plan of spirited away?

92
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:47,074
Yes, a person who has already been spirited away helps other candidates to fulfill their wishes to be "spirited away."

93
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:53,074
I think some of them offer a place to stay and account money.

94
00:08:56,083 --> 00:09:00,087
(Koharu): ｟ I don't have any memory .｠

95
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:04,024
So everyone keeps the secret.

96
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:10,024
What you can't do alone will only be possible if you work together.

97
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:15,035
A boy who couldn't save his friend alone....

98
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:19,035
It's the way he came up with to save other.

99
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:50,070
(Reiko): What?

100
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,074
"If you want me to hand over Chisato-chan...

101
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:56,076
Come to Onuma Pond."

102
00:09:56,076 --> 00:10:01,076
"If you don't come, I'll let the police know."

103
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:27,107
(Tomoaki): Don't cry. What are you dissatisfied with being born in the Takatsuki family? 

104
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:30,107
(cries)

105
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:41,121
Terauchi remembers when he was spirited away.

106
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:44,124
He told me that yesterday.

107
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,124
Did you talk about it to Akira?

108
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,130
What if, that makes him remember about his painful past....

109
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:03,076
His father was terrible and stict.

110
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,078
(Kiyoka):｟Akira｠

111
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:10,083
(Kenji): By the time Akira was 12 years old, he was already being prepared to take over the inheritance.

112
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,083
Akira laughed happily only when he was with me.

113
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,093
What do you want to say?

114
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,096
He seriously fought...

115
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:27,096
So that he can get over and move on from the past.

116
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:34,103
So let's see it

117
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:44,115
(Namiko): Excuse me

118
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,118
please

119
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:53,121
(Namiko): Mr. Takatsuki, I took care of that you asked me before.

120
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:57,130
Thank you.

121
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,130
(Namiko): Excuse me.

122
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:10,077
"Tengu-sama"

123
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:14,077
"Let's meet at Onuma Pond at dawn tomorrow".

Shunya-kun ...

128
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:24,081
My condolences are with you.

129
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:31,088
I also understood the mechanism of spirited away.

130
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:36,093
You created that "group."

131
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
But you crossed the line.

132
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:47,107
Return Chisato-chan

133
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:49,107
where?

134
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,114
To those terrible parents?

135
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:57,117
Leave it to the police. I did give hints to the police...

136
00:13:57,117 --> 00:14:00,117
They haven't been arrested yet!

137
00:14:01,054 --> 00:14:06,059
Professor, you should know

138
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:11,059
Chisato needs help, just like you

139
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,072
Don't you remember yet

140
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:24,072
What I wished is that I could rescue that person from here.

141
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,082
We wanted to be special

142
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:32,082
So we have to fulfill our missions.

143
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:38,088
Tengu-sama

144
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:45,095
(footsteps)

145
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:05,051
Why didn't you inform the police?

146
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:09,055
(Kousuke): Return Chisato back immediately, "We want to see her again."

147
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:14,055
(Reiko): When you'll calm down, ["We'll let the police know."]

148
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:30,076
Hey?

149
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:35,076
Chisato-chan will be happier if she doesn't live with you two.

150
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:45,088
... Sensei?

151
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:51,093
Did you use violence to Chisato-chan?

152
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,100
Answer!!

153
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Hey what are you!

154
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:11,047
Ah! Ah ...

155
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:17,053
It's our child, we can do whatever we want.

156
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,063
She's not your object.

157
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:35,075
♬～

158
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,075
Stop.

159
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,083
Leave it to me

160
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:57,094
Hey?

161
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:03,099
You can't kill people.

162
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,039
You can't punish people.

163
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,052
It's different.

164
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:22,052
It's impossible.

165
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:28,056
I blamed myself for not being able to help my friends...

166
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:32,062
You're a kind boy.

167
00:17:40,073 --> 00:17:42,075
I couldn't do anything as it was.

168
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,078
So I became special.

169
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:48,078
That was the only way to solve everything!

170
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:55,085
Even though you have only one life~~

171
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,089
Shunya ...

172
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:04,030
I'm sure it's a life he wanted to live.

173
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:11,030
There are many people who want to get away from these and want to take rest.

174
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:16,038
Because there are people who are willing to hunt down people!

175
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:24,050
You need to become terrifying tengu-sama to stop them!

176
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:30,050
So we should be that.

177
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:40,062
I also have something to talk about.

178
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:49,071
An era when many believed in mystery

179
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,080
Fear of non-human creatures...

180
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,083
Maybe it would be good if people were modest,

181
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,083
but…

182
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:07,021
People can be saved without relying on fear

183
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,029
With small kindness.

184
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:18,037
I was saved a lot of times by that.

She's Chisato Hasebe, who went missing.

196
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,086
I kidnapped her.
