he will scatter like dust in the wind.

It's been a long time. Would you like to have a drink?

I don't have a card these days.

33
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:06,310
After living like that for hundreds of years, on a day that was just right

34
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,510
it was my first love.

35
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,400
To be able to confess that ,

36
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm seeking

37
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,540
permission from the heavens.

38
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,030
And your last words?

39
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,730
The time I shared with you 

40
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,900
was all blindingly bright.

41
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:51,240
Because the day was good, because the day was not good

42
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,760
because the day was just right.

43

And also, no matter what happens...

45
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,070
it is not your fault.

46
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,860
That was a goodbye?

47
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,240
Seriously... should I kill him?

48
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,740
That day the Miscellaneously Omitted person...

49
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,950
walked for a long time in someone's tears.

50
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,600
So the Goblin's death would be as far as possible from her.

51
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,030
She's not here. She hasn't come back. She's not answering her phone, either.

52
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,830
I think she ran away.

53
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,200

54

She's not on the beach, either.

58
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,750
She didn't go to school, either.

59
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,450
She's not near the door in the library that she followed me through to Canada.

60
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,690
Not even near the park where she summoned me the second time.

Where is that store that you always bought chicken from?

63
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,030

I thought you would be looking for it.

66
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,870
Actually, I'm the culprit. I told her everything.

67

68

Did you perhaps?

69
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah. If she pulls out the sword you would die.

70
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,570
I told her everything.

71
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,730
Are you crazy? Why would you tell her? You told me to never tell her!

72
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,630
I did... but this time, as expected I am on the same side with the Miscellaneously Omitted person.

73

What kind of meddling is that? What do you mean you are on the same side?

There's no other meaning to that.

76

It's just that if you return to nothing, it would be a little boring.

77

You can get mad.

78

How could I get mad? How?

79

Are you hoping for her death to happen--

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,750
Between the buildings the super moon is shining monstrously.

162
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:18,710
Following the fog from the afternoon, the apperance of strangely red moon,

163
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,060
the citizens cannot hide their concern.

164
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,020
Get that sword pulled out of you as soon as you can.

165
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,640
Get it pulled out and go into nothingness.

166
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,040
If you don't go into nothingness, Eun Tak will die.

167
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,030
If I... make that choice,

168
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,480
you have to be ready with an excuse.

169
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,160
Father.

170
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,520
8:15 p.m.

171
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,590
The patient has passed away.

172
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,380
Father! Father!

173
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,610
Kim Ki Joong, 68 years old. Cause of death, excessive blood loss.

174
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,800
Ah, hot! Hot!

175
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,030
Father?

176
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,550
What?

177
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,120
Father?

178
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,310
Oh! Father! Did you come back alive, Father? You lost so much blood. This is...

179
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,660
Did you get up?

180
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,100
In front of my eyes, he just woke up.  He's alive.

181
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,900
He had excessive blood loss, but the body color was good.

182
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,380
The list of names just burned up. Is this a possible event?

183
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,790
It is possible, if that's the Goblin's fire.

184
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,780
This must be yours.

185
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,730
What is this?

186
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,270
The Goblin's apology.

187
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,870
Apology?

188
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,640
It's socks...

189
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,480
Is apologizing in advance enough? You caused the trouble,

190
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,470
so why does the Grim Reaper have to do the overtime? How dare you burn our list?

191
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,850
Has living forever made you go blind? The tragic fate of the two of you is unfortunate...

192
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,110
but that doesn't mean you can meddle with a human's life, you senseless goblin!

193
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,840
I just... wanted someone to see it.

194
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,810
It would be good if the deity saw it.

195
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,410
It would be better if Eun Tak saw it.

196
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,640
If you say it like that, what does that make me?

197
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,310
I am talking for nothing.

198
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,120
I should've just let the Miscellaneously Omitted person pull out the sword.

199
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,520
You're right. That would've been better.

200
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,940
In this world...

201
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:11,110
there are many weird beings that are unexplainable with words.

202
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,490
At times, they're closer to us than we think.

203
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,730
I think that you already had an idea.

204
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,340
Yoo Jae Shin!

205
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,080
Sorry.

206
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,810
Eh-hey!

207
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,060
One man who doesn't age, I know one.

208
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,800
Yeah?

209
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,270
The passport I made, places I prepared in Nice. Making me stay by Deok Hwa's side...

210
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,100
I believe that you gave me these jobs to recognize that being  on my own.

211
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:58,350
Have you by chance spoken of that existence to anyone?

212
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,270
There is no one.

213
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:04,930
Actually, he is the one who picked you.

214
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,530
He made a boy from a back alley without a dream

215
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:17,600
take the GED, have a dream,

216
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,830
enrolled him in a university. Who do you think is that faceless benefactor?

217
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,600
Remember. The person's real name is...

218
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,770
Kim as his last name, Chinese character 'Shin' which means trustworthy as his name.

219
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,930
Hey, Kim Shin. The Supermoon and the fog, was you.  Right, Uncle?

220
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,830
Why are you creating such a mess to find a high school girl?

221
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,430
I'm really scared that NASA would actually take you away.

222
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,450
Did you drink alcohol?

223
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,440
Yesterday, I drank.

224
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,710
Now, I'm sober.

225
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,140
Anyway, if I do find her, what would you do for me, Uncle? Will you give me a credit card?

226
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,920
If I can't find her, how would you?

227
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,310
She wouldn't have gone far. She has no money.

228
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:15,070
She has to be somewhere in Korea where you can go by bus. I have my ways.

229
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,010
Welcome.

230
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,030
Ski Equipment Rental

231
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,260
Please wait a moment.

232
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,770
Hello.

233
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,930
Yes, wait a moment, please.

234
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,360
Wait a moment. Yes.

235
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,680
[News alerts]

236
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,040
I found her. Right now, she's at a ski resort.

237
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,560
What if...

238
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,210
I decided not to be your bride. What happens?

239
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,350
Ah...

240
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,270
This sword wonbe pulled out.

241
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,320
Only you pull it out.

242
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,820
You need to take this sword out 

243
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,060
for me 

244
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,620
to be pretty.  I'm not pretty, now.

245
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:49,550
You have no idea. I'm the crazy one for laughing at this situation.

246
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,190
Crazy bastard.

247
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,570
Not today. Tonight, just let me laugh with you.

248
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,090
When the first snow comes?

249
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,630
First snow?

250
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,580
You need a broom then.

251
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,380
When the first snow comes.

252
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,710
There's too much snow.

253
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,780
Let's go home.

254
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,110
You shouldn't stay alone like this.

255
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,050
I don't have a home.

256
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,700
None of the places I thought were my home, was actually my home.

257
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,070
People just kept me close.  Some because of insurance money

258
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,100
and some because they wanted to die.

259
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,150
I know it all now. I'm the tool to end the Goblin's immortality.

260
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,500
I missed the opportunity to tell you.

261
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,980
Because I missed the opportunity, I was glad.

262
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,210
If possible, until the moment of death,

263
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,650
I was going to let myself miss every opportunity.

264
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,200
But I shouldn't have done that.

265
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,070
The blood of thousands is on this sword.

266
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,730
The weight of a person's life,

267
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,480
it wasn't for me to judge.

268
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,750
So take this sword out. I am asking you.

269
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,760
No.

270
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,780
I don't want to. I don't want to even if I die.

271
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,530
So don't look for me. Don't look for me

272
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,780
and let's live as though we don't know each other.

273
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,250
Go far away from me,

274
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,140
and just live for a very, very long time, Mr. Kim Shin.

275
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,860
Do you understand?

276
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,700
Don't appear again.

277
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,440
If you appear in front of my eyes again,

278
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,590
then I will really kill you then.

297
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,290
You did well on the exam.

298
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,040
You call this an excuse...

299
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,880
I was happy to have at least this as an excuse.

300
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,560
Even like this,

301
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,230
an excuse that I can come see you.

302
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,230
What do you want to do after seeing me?

303
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,780
What do you want to do with that excuse?

304
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,220
Live together or die together?

305
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,740
If you appear before me again,

306
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,650
didn't I tell you that I would kill you or not?

307
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,840
Fine, come here.

308
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,380
I will pull out the sword.

309
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,100
If that is what you wish so badly then I will pull it out for you.

310
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,810
Come here now.

311
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,270
This man, til the end.

312
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,300
Don't.

313
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,280
Do it. You have to do it.

314
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,250
Let go! Let go!

315
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,630
Let go! Let go, I said!

316
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,150
It was from that moment.

317
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,380
In the hotel, when you appeared,

318
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,580
it was from that moment.

319
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,800
Mister, do you love me?

320
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,710
If that is needed, I will do that too.

321
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,550
♬ And I'm here ♬

322
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,810
I love you.

323
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,890
So... did you really love me?

324
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,550
No?

325
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,290
You didn't do even that?

326
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,190
I'm scared.

327
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,750
I'm so scared.

328
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,120
So, I wish...

329
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,880
you would keep telling me that you need me.

330
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,120
I wish you would ask me to do that as well.

331
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,910
A permission that's like an excuse,

332
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,150
I wish I had it.

333
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,670
With that excuse, I...

334
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,290
I wish I could continue to live.

335
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,980
With you.

336
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,830
♬ I'll be here ♬

337
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,290
♬ For you ♬

338
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,380
♬ If I could fly above the clouds ♬

339
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,770
♬ Like all the birds ♬

340
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,350
♬ And I could hold you for a while ♬

341
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,860
♬ To let you feel my pulse ♬

342
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:29,200
♬ Still here all alone ♬

343
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,590
Hello. It's the customer's personal errand. Edge waxing.

344
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,390
He's asking to have it done within an hour.

345
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,750
Why isn't Chief Kim coming?

346
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,610
It's the end of my shift, so he will probably come.

347
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,230
- Why don't you wait for him?
- Yes.

348
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,900
Why are you alone? What about the Miscellaneously Omitted person?

349
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,950
- You didn't meet her?
- I met her.

350
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,740
- But she's not coming.
- What on earth happened?

351
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,860
It's my first time waiting for a document to be processed.

352
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,340
Miscellaneously Omitted person's register is out.

353
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,770
Are you sure it's Eun Tak's?

354
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,450
- It's empty. 
- It's there. The writing.

355
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,760
What on earth is this situation?

356
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,820
As if she's being pushed to her death.

357
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,070
I'm not the one who's doing that.

358
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,790
- And I'm sure you're not either.
- It must be me.

359
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,140
I have to die for her to live.

360
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,660
If I live then she dies.

361
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,280
That is the fate of that child and me.

362
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,790
This is the punishment that was bestowed to me.

363
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,620
This was God's true will.

364
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,030
Don't say something so weak. Even if it were God's will,

365
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,850
it is not mine.

366
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,680
You are also the same.

367
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:32,110
One hour from now, the time of death. You should hurry.

368
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,370
The phone is turned off.

369
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,000
This person is not able to be reached at this time.

370
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,210
 If not death will constantly haunt that child

371
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,820
I'm sure she's already confronted death multiple times..

372
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,210
She will face more in the future.

373
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,920
Those accidents will occur more frequently, and they'll be more intense than the ones up to now.

374
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,980
It's the first snow, Mister!

375
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,190
It's the first snow, Ahjussi. But how is it snowing already? It's amazing.

376
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,090
I wish you would keep telling me that you need me.

377
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,070
I wish you would ask that of me.

378
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,590
I wish I could use

379
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:51,020
permission as an excuse.

380
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,520
I need you.

381
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,240
That's all I ask of you.

382
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,090
I love you.

383
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,690
♬ See ya never gone my way  ♬

384
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,030
♬  Better will someday  ♬

385
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,680
♬   Never far away  ♬

386
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,710
Ji Eun Tak, have you come to your senses?

387
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,130
This is the hospital.

388
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,900
You showed symptoms of hypothermia and a concussion.

389
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,740
It's a relief that you're okay. If you were even a little bit late, 
your condition would've become dangerous.

390
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,850
Ah.

391
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,620
How long have I been in this state?

392
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,640
A day and a half.

393
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,320
Ah.

394
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,550
Then, what about the hospital fee?

395
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,360
Ah. You don't need to worry about that.

396
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,270
But what is your relationship with the CEO of the Cheon Woo Group?

397
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,990
The Chairman himself came in to admit you into the hospital. 
The entire hospital was in an uproar.

398
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,570
If you want, you can be discharged.

399
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,140
I recommend staying here for your safety--

400
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,020
I'm sorry, but

401
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,910
by chance, does anyone have a match or lighter...

402
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,400
Pardon?

403
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,270
♬  Please touch my heart just once  ♬

404
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,010
♬  Just like this It's been cold all day  ♬

405
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,800
♬   I'm standing underneath   ♬

406
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,460
♬   A sky colder than winter   ♬

407
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,310
♬  Even my tears are frozen ♬

408
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:12,290
♬  Please call quietly just once ♬

409
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,210
♬  My name you used to call countlessly  ♬

410
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,900
♬  Going back to eternity, just one day  ♬

411
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,860
♬  No, if I could see you just one minute  ♬

412
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:34,760
♬ If I could, I will endure it  ♬

413
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,940
♬  At the end of the waiting I hope you'll be standing there ♬

414
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,700
♬  Memories of you are like ♬

415
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,210
♬  a painting ♬

416
00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:01,480
♬  A day like a gift, I’ve waited for so long ♬

417
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,290
♬  Crosing a long time to reach you  ♬

418
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,730
♬  I will wait ♬

419
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:14,570
♬ You are the first snow in my heart ♬

420
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:19,110
♬  I will always ♬

421
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,980
You should've told me you were leaving...

422
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,910
I thought you weren't coming back so I--

423
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,720
I came early and waited.

424
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,090
Who told you to come early? You should come when I blow out the candle.

425
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,990
You should've come there. You should've appeared in front of my eyes.

426
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,590
I came here to hold your hand.

427
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,500
I don't know. Whatever.

428
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,990
Me, too.

429
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,350
What?

430
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,550
If you don't know, never mind.

431
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,110
I know it though.

432
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,270
Then that's good.

433
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:07,300
I... have something to confess.

434
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:16,270
I can't see anything else about you, Mister.

435
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:22,350
You're tall, your clothes look expensive, and your eyes are amazing.

436
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:26,340
That's all I see. So,

437
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,150
I can't pull out the sword for you anymore.

438
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,250
I won't pull it out, even if you smile. In my eyes,

439
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,830
you're still really pretty.

440
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,810
♬  It's a beautiful life  ♬

441
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:04,320
♬ I’ll be by your side ♬

442
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,550
♬  It's a beautiful life  ♬

443
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,800
♬ I’ll stand behind you ♬

444
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,620
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬
♬ Beautiful day ♬

445
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,070
♬ I'll live in your memory ♬

446
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:27,000
♬ Beautiful life ♬
♬ Beautiful day ♬

447
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,850
♬ Stay with me ♬

448
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:39,230
♬ Beautiful my love ♬
♬ Beautiful your heart ♬

449
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:46,620
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬

450
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,840
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬

451
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,940
♬ Beautiful life ♬

452
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,620
His face is pale white and his lips are red.

453
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,360
He has black clothes

454
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,440
and is holding a black hat.

455
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,520
Oh my.

456
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,140
What is it? Why?

457
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:24,070
By chance, did you exchange your names? He's the Grim Reaper.

458
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:28,370
What did I tell you?  I told you to be careful of men with black hats!

459
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,880
Do you make enough money to eat? Do you have any other customers besides me?

460
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,520
This woman, if you're wary of men, you can't date!

461
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:42,250
Grim Reaper? You have to be believable if you want to write me a talisman.

462
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,200
Then who is this man? He's very tall.

463
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,370
He seems like an older brother type, and has dinosaur-like features. (big features)

464
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:57,820
His voice... if you listen to him, you feel as though you're at the smallest cafe in the world...

465
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,470
Gong Yoo?
 (the actor who plays the Goblin and also the main actor of Coffee Prince: hence, the word "cafe")

466
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,920
Then stay well.

467
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:10,620
Did you receive a sparkling item from somewhere?

468
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,940
- How did you know that?
- Throw it away.

469
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,180
You can't take things whose previous owners are unknown.

470
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:26,010
You don't know what's inside. There might be the owner's regret, guilt, and longing, etc.

471
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:37,050
What regret, guilt

472
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,560
and  longing would be inside this?

473
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:54,250
But anyway that Kim Woo Bin or director is unreachable again.

474
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,670
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

475
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,910
Seriously, it's so pitiful that I always have to contact him first.

476
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,490
Right now?

477
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,670
Geez.

478
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,420
- Are you busy?
- Yes. I'm so busy. I'm going insane.

479
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,010
What are you doing right now?

480
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,630
I'm trying to figure out my passcode. I want to turn it off, just in case it makes another sound.

481
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,910
[The passcode failed. Try again in 30 seconds.]

482
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,560
[What are you doing now?]

483
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,820
Why aren't you trying to contact me again?

484
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,400
That's...

485
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:42,020
First, because I feel sorry about having erased your memory. Second...

486
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:52,530
 Who are you, and why are you so beautiful?

487
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,880
I think I've started to have a crush on someone else!

488
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,960
I'm sorry. I am also feeling very confused about myself for being this way.

489
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,800
It seems like you've gotten a message.

490
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,210
I miss you.

491
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,520
- Me, too. 
- Why am I constantly like this...

492
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,720
No, I haven't heard anything.

493
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,210
I didn't hear anything, I didn't hear anything, I didn't...

494
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,530
♬ Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah!

495
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,980
♬ Glory, glory, glory, hallelujah!

496
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,930
I know that you're there! Come out and show yourself!

497
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,900
How dare a lowly ghost  try to harm a human being?

498
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,570
Come out!  Not coming out, get lost!

499
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:44,620
If you don't obey me, I'll sing the song again!

500
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,670
♬ Glory, glory, hallelujah!

501
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:54,220
♬Glory, glory, hallelujah!

502
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,420
Why are you empty-handed? What about your luggage? Weren't you on your way home?

503
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,130
No, I was heading to my part-time work.

504
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,630
Since it's Christmas season, they pay really well. It's a relief I didn't get fired.

505
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,200
Let's finish up what we're supposed to do. Then, let's buy some beef and return home in glory.

506
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,770
Until when? Until when are you going to be here?

507
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:19,240
What do you mean by until when? Until all of February's snow at the ski resort melts.

508
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,670
You can go back home first.

509
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:23,050
What? February?!

510
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,070
President Yoo. Yes, President Yoo, it's me.

511
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,570
I was going to ask you to fire someone quickly using your vast connections.

512
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,100
Otherwise, I'm planning to quickly melt all the snow at the ski resort. Which option shall I go for?

513
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,390
I'm back.

514
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:47,810
I'm sorry. You must have worried a lot.

515
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:51,020
- A little. He's the one who worried a lot. The one who found out about you was Deok Hwa.

516
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,710
And the one who got you here is me.

517
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:59,600
It's the first time to have a place to return to, so it feels weird.

518
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,240
It feels like this place is now really my home.

519
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,120
This girl's starting again... Every time you're asked something, there's a sad story!

520
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,510
It scares me to ask you to come back home.

521
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,340
Just wear it. You should come with me.

522
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,750
Where are you going to take my Mister? That's something I feel sensitive about.

523
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:26,220
She said... 'my'!

524
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,070
I can hear everything, you cheesy Goblin!

525
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,370
He's happy because you said "my."

526
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,810
Follow me quickly! Leave Mr. Buckwheat there!

527
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:48,580
But who are you submitting this report to?

528
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,010
Are you submitting it directly to...?

529
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:55,510
It doesn't go up that far. We were probably created to do all the tedious work.

530
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,500
Shouldn't the handwriting be the same?

531
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,740
I'll say that it's been written with my left hand, so just shut up and write!

532
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,420
But she was pretty. The owner of the chicken restaurant you visit frequently.

533
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,650
You met her? You didn't tell her anything useless by any chance, did you?

534
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,540
What I told her wasn't something that was particularly useful.

535
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,160
You told her? That I was a Reaper?

536
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,220
You told her, too! That I would disappear to nothing once the sword gets pulled out.

537
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,200
Did you really tell her? Really?

538
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,220
Wow, how could you! Hey, really... you! Oh no! Oh no!

539
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,000
How? How? He's coming in, coming in!

540
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,930
Hey, there. I'm really sorry, but it's an emergency... Could I use the toilet?

541
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:40,330
This is a human being, right?

542
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:44,590
It's not an immortal for sure... But human beings cannot enter this place!

543
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,430
Wow.

544
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,080
Please... What should I do... It's urgent!!

545
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,010
Thank you, thank you. It's really urgent.

546
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:59,260
Wow... There is no door that a human being's desperation can't open.

547
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,810
I can't believe it even after witnessing it.

548
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:05,270
You even believe in God that's not visible. Then, why can't you believe a human being's desperation?

549
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:08,940
That's called the will of a human being. The power that enables them to change their destiny on their own!

550
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,460
How can an immortal's tea-place be a human being's mark of territory?

551
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,030
How can I write an explanation report for this case...!

552
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:20,140
Sit.

553
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,300
Write this one, too; it happened because of you!

554
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,630
You can make Deok Hwa do it when you get home.

555
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:26,480
[Hiring] 

556
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,140
Do you have a boyfriend?

557
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,600
I am Ji Eun Tak.

558
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,040
I lost my parents at age nine and...

559
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,700
You can ask me about anything that you're curious about.

560
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,140
I can adjust myself so that I can satisfy all your requirements.

561
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,280
Do you have any plans later on?

562
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,680
- No. 
- Then, today is our official first day together.

563
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,210
Get to work.

564
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,880
Yes! I'll take care of everything!

565
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,580
But how did you move to a better place?

566
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,780
Life is all or nothing. I got my apartment security deposit back.

567
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,050
How did you find me here without even calling me beforehand?

568
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,910
I have my own means.

569
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,480
Even ghosts would be surprised.

570
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,770
Are you a beggar? How can an elementary student not even have $1?

571
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,370
You guys don't have money either!!

572
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:09,710
That's why I'm telling you to bring it, then we would have it.

573
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,950
Don't hit me! Wind blast!

574
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,910
This kid must be crazy. He said 'wind blast.'

575
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:21,330
Your mom ran away since you read comic books all the time.

576
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:24,410
Hey! You boys are cowards!

577
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,980
Come here, come and get hit yourselves, too!

578
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,930
Let's go, let's go.

579
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:34,850
Are you okay?

580
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:43,170
Someday, you'll be able to shoot a real wind blast. Where's your home? Is it near?

581
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,860
The results would have come out already...  What should I do?

582
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,170
I don't know.

583
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,450
What do I do?

584
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:18,320
[Yeonhui University. Congratulations, you've been accepted.]

585
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,140
What do I do? Awesome! No way!

586
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:30,150
Now, let's print out the tuition bill!

587
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,700
It's not an error. Someone paid your tuition.

588
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:54,750
 He told me to make sure and tell you if you called. It was Kim Shin. 

589
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,310
Mr. Shin Kim? You paid my tuition?

590
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,380
Seriously...

591
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,240
I asked them to keep it a secret, but in the end...

592
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,560
According to her, you asked her to make sure to let me know that you had paid it for me.

593
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,180
She insisted on knowing my name, so I couldn't help but tell her--

594
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,750
According to her, she kept asking you for the name of the student, but you kept telling her your name.

595
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,410
I'm not sure if this would be an appropriate university acceptance gift.

596
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:33,170
This pretty bag...

597
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,250
It's appropriate! Wow, that's great!  Wow! It's appropriate!

598
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:41,120
I knew it would be appropriate. Congratulations!

599
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:47,410
I really missed you! A purse, perfume, five...

600
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,910
There's no $5,000. I paid your tuition with that.

601
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,110
Mister...

602
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,180
Don't be too moved. I'm lending it to you.

603
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:06,540
I know... why did you just give it to me at first, but you're lending it to me now?

604
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,070
How could a person's heart change?

605
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,940
You're the only mortal in this house. How can you not know that yet?

606
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,210
- Wow... 
 - $5.20 per month...

607
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,040
Pay it over 80 years. You can't miss even a month.

608
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,280
80 years?

609
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,310
Yeah, you can't pay back any sooner either.

610
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:23,580
- What? You don't like it? 
- No.

611
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,840
If you're so determined like this, I made up my mind. I set my mind to it.

612
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,050
About what?

613
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:31,990
A date.

614
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,850
Dummy... when I was at the ski resort, not my report card...

615
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,610
If you had brought this purse, I would've came back with you right away.

616
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:46,040
Wow... that's exactly what I was going to do.

617
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,940
- The Mr. Grim Reaper stopped you, huh? 
 - Yeah!

618
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,830
As expected... Mr. Grim Reaper saved someone's life,

619
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:54,280
or I would've killed you on the spot.

620
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,830
Don't eat mine. Eat yours.

621
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,370
I ate all of mine.

622
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:00,660
- Don't smile and keep eating. 
 - Just one bite.

623
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,710
- But you know... 
 - What now?

624
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:10,140
Would there be love among these things somewhere?

625
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,180
Look carefully. I tried my best to put it in there.

626
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:27,910
Here is the list you asked for of gifts  that female high school or college students prefer.

627
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,780
Bangtan Sonyeondan?
 (BTS, boy band)

628
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:37,580
What do these boys do?

629
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:42,590
♬  Why do you make my heart waver? Make my heart waver?  ♬

630
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:47,570
Oh... they work to shake up people's hearts.

631
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:49,720
They're shaking up people's hearts quite a bit these days.

632
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,150
EXO? Is that an alcoholic beverage?

633
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,610
No, it's not.

634
01:02:54,610 --> 01:03:00,650
♬  Growl, growl, growl.  ♬

635
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:04,760
Being an executive assistant is an extreme job. Yeah...

636
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,170
I enjoy my job very much.

637
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:11,850
I'll choose number three for the gift.

638
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,000
Oh...

639
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,840
I know what digital camera is.

640
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:33,510
 Dear Ji Eun Tak, you've worked hard. 

641
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,610
 I hope each moment is remembered forever. 

642
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,940
 From Yoo Shin Woo. 

643
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,770
- Oh, you scared me! 
 - Aigoo, he scared me.

644
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,940
Since when were you standing here?

645
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:48,420
Why are you so shocked? Did you do something wrong?

646
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,880
I was surprised by my face.

647
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,350
I'm handsome, huh? I'm too much... too much...

648
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,310
You said you don't even have any money. What's with the camera?

649
01:03:58,310 --> 01:04:00,180
Ah, it's yours.

650
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,750
Why is that mine?

651
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:05,290
A gift from my grandpa. My selfie is my gift to you.

652
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,210
Really?

653
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,750
I'm so touched.

654
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:19,380
The only gift I ever received was a building. You must be so happy to receive a digital camera.

655
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:23,850
Please tell the Chairman I'm so, so grateful.

656
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,950
Please give me my camera.

657
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,410
Let me just have ten minutes.

658
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,130
- Give it to me.  
- Just five minutes.

659
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:36,280
- Give it to me. 
 - J-Just five minutes.

660
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,550
Ah, give it!

661
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,410
Three minutes. Three minutes.

662
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:39,810
Give it I said!

663
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,380
Three minutes.

664
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,090
Give it!

665
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,120
Three, three. Oh, it's the Goblin!

666
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:52,740
It's true. Having kids in the household makes the house livelier.

667
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,520
What about the roster? You didn't receive anymore, right?

668
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,670
I would've told you if I did.

669
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:03,410
I was getting curious about that. What you're going to do now.

670
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:09,090
Do you remember that man who barged into your tea room, one time?

671
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:12,600
How could I forget him? What about him?

672
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,180
A human's desperation can open any door.

673
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,650
Maybe once in a while, one of those doors becomes a variable in God's plan.

674
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:27,790
So I plan to start searching, ardently.

675
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:32,510
About which door I need to open for it to become a variable to the deity.

676
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't know whether it'll take 100 years or 10 months, but for now I have decided to stay by that child's side.

677
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:46,590
Though, while doing that, I don't know what kind of door I'll end up opening.

678
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:48,750
I just hope it's not the door to my room.

679
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,520
But isn't poop a little petty to be in the God's plan?

680
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,630
What reason is there that God would block that guy's passing? (poop)

681
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,460
I was feeling a bit moved just a moment ago.

682
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,370
Uncles!

683
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:03,930
Me, too! Me, too!

684
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,580
Me, too! Me, too! Me, too!

685
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,030
Now... I'm taking it.

686
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:11,450
What are you doing not moving aside? Let them take one alone.

687
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,300
I don't want to! I sat here first.

688
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,190
I'm going to take it.

689
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,410
What?

690
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,670
I have a question, I'll move if you answer.

691
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,310
Ah, what is it now?

692
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,590
 Backing out suddenly while driving, solving math problems writing with a mechanical pencil,

693
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,300
smiling when she talks,

694
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,230
keeping her off the roads, away from the cars.

695
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,240
You'll never know what our boss wants.

696
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,450
Be ready for anything.

697
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:09,390
What are you doing since earlier? After calling me after a million years?

698
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:12,410
It's dangerous, so I was trying to keep you on the inside of the pavement.

699
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,510
By acting that awkwardly?

700
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,770
You had something to say, so say it first since I'm curious.

701
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,170
I have no religion.

702
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:25,650
What?

703
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,750
How does he talk so well?

704
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,290
Do you have a religion, by any chance?

705
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,570
Were you still thinking about that until now?

706
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:37,100
I don't think I got to tell you last time.

707
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,210
But... why do you keep smiling since earlier?

708
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:44,100
Me? Does my makeup look weird?

709
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:48,410
Rather than that, don't you think I'm cute?

710
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:51,530
Where? Why didn't you meet me on Christmas?

711
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,340
You would have been cute if you had called me that day. What did you do?

712
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:56,150
You wouldn't have gone to a church since you have no religion.

713
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,470
Christmas is a bit... you know.

714
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:03,370
It's someone's birthday, it would be wrong to go against it.

715
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:09,570
But I said I have no religion, do you seriously think I'm not cute?

716
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,960
Ah, goosebumps...

717
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,170
Did you have to go that far?

718
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,470
No, it's deja vu.

719
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:20,090
I think I remember this from before. It's so fresh in my mind.

720
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,270
Ah, I got goosebumps!

721
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:30,290
You didn't have to walk me.

722
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,660
Why are you telling me that now that we're already here?

723
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,040
See you later.

724
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,870
Oh! It's the Grim Reaper!

725
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:43,940
Most of our sales come from that person's pocket. Unlike someone else...

726
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,440
How much is fried chicken? I could buy the whole shop.

727
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,390
Eh... you're scared of chicken blood, I read up all on goblins.

728
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:54,800
I'm not scared of it, I just like to keep a distance from it.

729
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,830
Wait... Is that why you got me a job at chicken shop in the first place?

730
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:01,460
To keep away from me, too?

731
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,260
Ah, you're talking about way back when...

732
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,550
So that was true. That was your intention. I didn't even know. Never mind.

733
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:12,220
I got it, so you can go now. I will live over there for hundreds of thousands of years, so don't come looking for me.

734
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,030
Coward!

735
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,580
What? What did you say to me?

736
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,070
Ah, it's the first time anyone's called me that. It's really my first time, really!

737
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:24,840
The people used to say to me,  "Wow! Hooray!"

738
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,530
Shall I show you how brave I am?

739
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,930
Where are you going?

740
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:36,000
Our boss isn't like most other women.

741
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:01,960
By any chance is he the man giving you trouble?

742
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,530
They can hear everything, Boss.

743
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:15,000
She doesn't know my voice? Her voice is from that phone call before?

744
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,850
They can hear all, shut up!

745
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:19,910
Is that so?

746
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:24,700
We meet again. I'm surprised that you two are friends...

747
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:27,450
He came to the old shop looking for you.

748
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:29,240
Ah, I see...

749
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,010
- How much did you say? 
 - Not much.

750
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:33,420
Yeah, he didn't. So I still don't know who he is.

751
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,340
It's rude of me, but how old are you?

752
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,890
Why are you asking knowing it's rude?

753
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,030
That's how you evade my question, huh?

754
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:44,170
I'm not evading. I'm flat out refusing to answer you.

755
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:48,290
And you're dropping the honorifics. Why?

756
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,010
Why is it?

757
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:53,630
I'm much older than I look, I'm a quite complicated man.

758
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,890
Now, now... If you have had enough, please leave. It's a time when we get many customers.

759
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,750
I still haven't eaten yet.

760
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:06,230
No, you've eaten all. Now please just go home.

761
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,080
Because of you, things have gone weird!

762
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,120
Customer, you should both leave together.

763
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:12,950
Get up both of you, quickly!

764
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,840
- I don't want to! 
 - I don't want to!

765
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:34,960
Let's see. What is X? What's X?

766
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,710
What are you doing?

767
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,100
You really don't know a lot about women.

768
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,670
It doesn't look like you know the answer.

769
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,980
Just drink your beer.

770
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:48,070
Excuse me, Ms. Kim Sun.

771
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,220
Two beers over here please.

772
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:57,290
Who?

773
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,560
Two beers.

774
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,410
Can I talk to you for a moment? Outside, in private!

775
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:17,670
Ah, okay. Let's do that.

776
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,060
What are you doing?

777
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:27,890
What do you mean?

778
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:32,580
Just earlier, you called me Kim Sun.

779
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,780
What about that?

780
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,770
How do you know my name?

781
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:38,670
I'm sure that I never told you my real name.

782
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:43,660
 Sorry, we didn't meet today.

783
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,280
I asked how do you know it. Why do you know it?

784
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,670
I said... Ms. Kim Sunny.

785
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,620
Ah, it's very cold, isn't it?  I'll get your coat—

786
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:02,440
I haven't finished talking.

787
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,890
 (What is this?) 

788
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,670
Something went wrong.

789
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:06,850
Maybe, it started with you, that's what it seems like.

790
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,280
 (What's the matter?) 

791
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,980
Why... exactly?

♬  When I look at you  ♬

794
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:21,300
♬  I don't know why I my tears keep falling  ♬

795
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:29,580
♬  Were you circling around coming toward me?  ♬

796
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:36,470
♬  The love that couldn't be avoided  ♬

797
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,640
♬  I love you  ♬

798
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:42,680
♬  Love you, love you  ♬

799
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:47,690
 The woman in the painting is Kim Shin's sister. 

800
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:50,480
 This ring... what did you mean by it? 

801
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,710
♬  And I miss you  ♬

802
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:59,380
 The moment I saw the woman in the painting, I cried. 

803
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:03,860
♬  My fate, my love  ♬

804
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:08,560
 put this world at this king's feet, 

805
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,520
 and put that king at my feet 

806
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,980
You, knave!

807
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,800
You, bitch!

808
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,090
I will obey your command.

809
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:24,010
Do you even know what you're asking for?

810
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:28,320
♬  I could feel that we were fated to be  ♬

811
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,970
You must come visit me often.

812
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:33,400
Do you even know who this guy is that you're seeing him?

813
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,280
The Grim Reaper?

814
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:41,030
I was contemplating whether I should hold your hand once more or not, Sunny.

815
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,830
Then, can you hold it today? When I'm a year younger?

816
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:47,660
 The history between those two... 

817
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:51,930
 Is it relevant to my forgotten memory? 

818
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:57,170
Yes, it looks to be that way.

819
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:01,420
♬ We should never part again.   ♬

820
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:07,350
♬  Don't leave my side
