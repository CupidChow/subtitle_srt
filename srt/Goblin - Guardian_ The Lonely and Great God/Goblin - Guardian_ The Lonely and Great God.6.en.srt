1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,060
Goblin

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,060
Goblin

3
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,460
This is my second time here. I might be a regular at this rate.

4
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,760
We sat there back then.

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Welcome to Quebec! Please have a seat.

6
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,760
That's what I mean. It's not as though I've been abroad before...

7
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,530
Why would you go abroad when you're in your nines? (Years ending in 9 are thought to be dangerous) 

8
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,190
When I was 29, I didn't even go to the supermarket in front of my house. 

9
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,760
- Really?
- Yeah, because I didn't have any appointments.

10
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,700
But I'm getting around so well for someone who's never been abroad before.

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,430
I just get lost a little and did not skip meals. And I will be eating a big steak..

12
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,290
I... am here in a cool restaurant with a guy..

13
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,970
What about the restaurant? It's the man who should be cool.

14
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,090
I'm sleepy. I'm hanging up..

15
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,530
Okay. Goodnight.

16
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,770
CEO, over here.

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,220
At the age of 29, you're still shining.

18
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,540
♬   Loneliness was like a prison   ♬

19
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,590
But I'm not...

20
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,160
by your side.

21
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,210
My life of eternity

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,480
has finally come to an end.

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,650
The time after my death

24
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,620
you are still here.

25
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,720
You've forgotten me

26
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,650
and your life is perfectly complete with me gone.

27
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,890
I have to disappear

28
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,050
to make you smile.

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,030
This is the decision I have to make.

30
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,200
I have to end my life.

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,960
♬  I will certainly find you ♬

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,600
♬   I will certainly recognize you  ♬

33
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,390
♬ Wherever you are. Whatever you look like ♬

34
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,820
♬   I will certainly recognize you   ♬

35
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,950
♬   I will certainly remember. I will look at you  ♬

36
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,860
♬   Even at a place without you  ♬

37
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,500
In the end,

38
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,460
that's the decision I made.

39
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,430
♬   I will retain it all  ♬

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,220
I must seem human, so let's walk.

41
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,400
Get in!

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,520
No human can walk all the way to Incheon.

43
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,440
Are you sure I'm allowed to join you?

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,260
I told him to bring a friend, too.

45
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,290
You need to see a guy when he's with a friend.

46
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,630
Their stories don't add up and they make a mistake. And that mistake is that man's real self.

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,480
Even if they make a mistake, how I'd love to meet men like them.

48
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
What kind of women do you think they date?

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,830
Look at the car, clothes, watch and looks.

50
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,680
Some wench must be so happy.

51
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,860
Yeah, I'm happy.

52
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,260
Pull the sword out. Right now.

53
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,760
Please!

54
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,990
You come out suddenly and what?

55
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,060
- Earlier I knocked but you didn't answer. 
- So I'm out here to answer you.

56
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,900
I want to end it now.

57
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,490
What?

58
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,870
The thought that I could choose.

59
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,000
Earlier, the choice you made at last. That?

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,010
What is that? Exactly what choice...

61
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,020
did you make?

62
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,170
Only answers, no questions.

63
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm sorry, but for that,

64
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,480
my research isn't done.

65
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,980
What research?

66
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,470
I found your name on the internet.

67
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,210
There's nothing about your life, or anything.

68
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,250
Like someone erased it all.

69
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,770
You said this to me before.

70
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,770
That when I discover something about you,

71
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,210
I'd resent you a lot.

72
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,210
That "what" is the sword.

73
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,310
And I discovered it.

74
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,670
But I don't resent you and you said I'd resent you.

75
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,790
Which means there's something else still remaining. That's why.

76
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,110
That sword...

77
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,980
You said it was by someone you thought would never do it.

78
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,610
Are you by chance, someone who did something bad,

79
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,930
that your records in history were erased?

80
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,630
If you're getting punished for doing something bad,

81
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,670
it's not quite right to pull out the sword.

82
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,840
Are you by chance...

83
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,470
treason...

84
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,340
Did you commit something like that?

85
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,920
Yeah. What was said is true.

86
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,530
It was a busy life just to survive.

87
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,040
They were times not recorded in history.

88
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,770
I put all my efforts into it,

89
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,150
but even my death was not honorable.

90
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,430
As I advanced toward the king. 

91
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,980
there was nothing to be gained.

92
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,350
But I  moved on.

93
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,220
At each and every step I took 

94
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,780
innocent beings lost their lives.

95
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,090
My crime was not forgiven. 

96
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,320
And now I'm amidst my punishment.

97
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,280
This sword

98
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,720
is that punishment.

99
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,350
But...

100
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,640
even if that's a punishment,

101
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,980
isn't receiving 900 years of it plenty?

102
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,200
No.

103
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,190
It couldn't be a punishment. A god couldn't

104
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,540
have given me that ability.

105
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,800
If you were truly a bad person,

106
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,510
if you were truly a bad person,

107
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,680
he'd only create a goblin.

108
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,840
He wouldn't have him meet the goblin bride,

109
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,010
and have her pull out that sword.

110
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,030
I don't know what kind of an existence you had,

111
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,890
you are being loved. For real.

112
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,010
What I meant by something bad,

113
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,760
was something like falling in love with the king's woman,

114
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,410
and you were imprisoned for it. That was my version.

115
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,050
I'm sorry I mentioned treason.

116
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,810
Then now,

117
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,920
could you make me pretty?

118
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,210
- Yes. I can't.
- Okay, you thought...

119
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,630
So mean.

120
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,160
You lived with that thought daily  for 900 years?

121
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,890
Then, you were in despair every day for 900 years.

122
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,140
You're so pitiful.

123
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,920
Um... could we come to a consensus?

124
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,290
I'm so sad so I'm crying.

125
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,500
But how can you keep asking with words only?

126
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,280
Doesn't it occur to you that

127
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,180
you really don't work hard at trying to get pretty?

128
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,180
- What did you say? 
- You heard me.

129
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,710
I know this because I have been pitiful, too. But for your information, when you're pitiful,

130
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,190
something more concrete is better than just pity.

131
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,530
- It's time for me to go to my part-time work.
- Hey!

132
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,880
While I am away for my work, think about it hard.

133
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,860
What I might want? You're more pitiful than me.

134
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,290
I'm going to scold them all for you.

135
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,130
Wait!  What do you want?

136
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,000
Money, house, jewels, things like that?

137
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,720
Would it really be that?

138
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,560
Then, by chance, that thing that if you need it

139
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,320
I could do it for you. That?

140
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,200
What, love?

141
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,720
Buy a house filled with jewels with money

142
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,270
and fill it with love. You couldn't think of that?

143
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,380
- You go. Hurry and go to your work. 
- I already told you.

144
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,530
I guess maybe because you used to be a military officer that you are not good at memorizing.

145
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,290
Hey! There's no distinction in one's career.

146
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,130
Hey, that's belittling a job!

147
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:17,010
She consoles me and she cries along with me but she won't pull the sword out for me.

148
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,550
How did she get to that conclusion in the midst of that sadness?

149
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,900
CEO, over here.

150
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,640
She met the CEO amidst that.

151
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,840
While the one who is to die, dies.

152
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,110
- CEO? 
- Over here. 
 - Over here?

153
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,560
She is a makeup artist and I'm self-employed.

154
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Your friend who accompanied you, pardon my rudeness, but what kind of an occupation do you have?

155
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not a friend but a much younger brother and my occupation is third-generation heir.

156
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,790
Maybe that's why I'm getting punished.

157
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,830
A punishment like you.

158
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,020
I'm Yoo Deok Hwa.

159
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh, right.

160
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,620
And you?

161
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,130
What line of work are you in?

162
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,270
You don't have an occupation?

163
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,440
A type of service rank.

164
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,210
Due to the nature of the work, the details are confidential.

165
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,850
I hope you understand.

166
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,650
Then, today, do you have a name?

167
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,010
Kim Woo Bin.

168
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,810
Service rank? I guess a waiter?

169
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,540
They can hear you, girl.

170
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,820
Do you have a business card? Give me one and I'll come by.

171
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,980
Business card?

172
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,990
So I should have something each time.

173
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,910
If you tell me in advance, next time, I'll prepare...

174
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,820
You really were an heir?

175
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,280
Yes. I was born and that's how it was.

176
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,810
I guess that's when he's getting successor training.

177
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,500
Look how he's eating ox bone soup.

178
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,970
I didn't recognize you.

179
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,710
Since tall, rich, young and handsome only exists in fantasies.

180
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm Sunny.

181
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,310
Your name is so cool.

182
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,790
Yoo Deok Hwa.

183
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,720
You, too, Sunny. Your name's cool, too.

184
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,710
Wow, so sensible. You understand so quickly.

185
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,460
But did it just get darker in here?

186
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,150
I'll go first.

187
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,150
- Go ahead. 
- Say that.

188
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,590
I'll go first.

189
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,550
You, too.

190
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,850
I'll go first.

191
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,020
Forget what I just did.

192
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,810
Where did everyone go?

193
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,620
They left first because they are busy.

194
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,470
How did they both go?

195
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,320
- She isn't someone who does that. 
 - I don't have a clue.

196
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,890
This, let me give it to you.

197
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,670
It's alright.

198
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,980
- You grabbed it first.

199
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,920
But you paid for it, Woo Bin.

200
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,480
Since it suits you better.

201
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,660
Alright. I'll take it then.

202
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,780
Since I got a ring from you, can you give me the phone number?

203
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,390
My number is the one I called you from yesterday.

204
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,210
Not yours. The third-generation heir.

205
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:53,370
My friend took the business card so I don't have his contact.

206
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,420
I don't feel right asking her about it.

207
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,660
If he's really the Yoo Deok Hwa of Cheonwoo Group,

208
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,370
he's my lord.

209
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,940
He's a lord?

210
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,490
Landlord.

211
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,640
So give me his number, please.

212
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,150
I have a lot to tell him.

213
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,220
Just a minute.

214
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,780
Let me see. It'll be faster...

215
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,460
Did you throw it at me? To someone who's helping you?

216
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,830
I was just caught off guard. Thank... Thank you.

217
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,500
Alright. What's the pattern. Or passcode?

218
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,760
I don't have any.

219
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,180
Every time, you really have so many don't have's.

220
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,500
I guess you know the goblin and his wife?

221
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,890
Well, unintentionally.

222
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,870
What enterprise is this goblin in? Catering?

223
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,760
The goblin I know runs a rice cake shop.

224
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,040
The goblin I know is just in the enterprise.

225
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,910
You are really a strange person.

226
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,700
Does human medicine work on you?

227
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,850
I chose between alcohol and medicine.

228
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,590
Did the meeting go well for you?

229
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm drinking alcohol.

230
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,740
She says I'm a strange person.

231
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,300
Since I have a lot of not have's. Especially, a business card.

232
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,420
You fooled her well when you're not a person.

233
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,770
Is it bipolar or depression?

234
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,410
It's ache.

235
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,520
You are just a side effect that came from defying the principle of not getting involved in human life and death. 

236
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,410
There's the method of you just dying as the original order had you do. 

237
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,520
If that's needed, then I'll do that, too. 

238
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,240
I love you. 

239
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,200
The words I spit out are all coming back to me.

240
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,230
The side effect of messing with human life and death is too big.

241
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,450
For a big person, there is nothing less desirable.

242
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,510
You only got tall (and still immature).

243
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,820
Since I have lived this long already,

244
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,100
I should be able to live without spitting out words that I shouldn't.

245
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,920
Maybe I deserve to die.

246
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,160
There's no death deserving death.

247
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Really?

248
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,750
The problem is there are always exceptions.

249
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,530
I thought you'd laugh.

250
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,980
Why did you take the medicine? Did something happen to the miscellaneously omitted?

251
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,850
No, we were just talking this and that she cried, saying I was pitiful.

252
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,850
So I had my hopes up. She said she cried because she was sad but she won't pull the sword out for me.

253
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,370
Not like only she cried.

254
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,830
You cried? In front of the miscellaneously omitted?

255
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,820
Like very briefly. It was barely.

256
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,440
Pathetic. You're done now.

257
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,150
Women like the uncaring and indifferent ones that won't look them in the eyes.

258
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,220
Those kinds of men. How you show your tears...

259
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,190
So you cried the first time right away?

260
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,140
Drink up!

261
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,600
You better make your decision quick one way or the other. Good or bad.

262
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,170
You're not even Hamlet.

263
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,380
That buddy Shakespeare.

264
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,300
We only talked about "to be or not to be" and he ended up writing that grand masterpiece.

265
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,970
Are you feeling unwell? Should we go to the hospital?

266
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,250
Can it be treated?

267
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,070
Are you not familiar with placebo effect?

268
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,310
- Maybe some counseling. 
- The sword started to ache.

269
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,660
If god truly only gives you only as much as  you can handle,

270
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,340
then I wonder if he's overestimated me too much.

271
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,580
Since you are feeling down, do you want a hug?

272
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,340
Well, if you hate the thought that much...

273
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,460
Gosh, you are annoying. Stop it!

274
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,220
As expected, it's so beautiful. It does belong to me.

275
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,850
Did you buy a ring?

276
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,600
No, a man gave it to me. That man.

277
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,970
Wow, the man from the pedestrian crossing bridge? Did you meet?

278
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,890
When? How is he?

279
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,110
He is still handsome and still very strange.

280
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,060
He is very strange, however as soon as I see his face I keep forgetting about everything.

281
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,410
By the way, that looks like a very old ring.

282
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,900
Once, I also got a ring. From that jerk.

283
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,090
I will get my revenge on that jerk. A bloody revenge...

284
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,760
There's order even in the afterlife. Let me leave first!

285
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,930
Goodness, my poor child!

286
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,910
For my child's sake, can you please ask the Goblin for the winning lottery number?

287
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,210
I've heard you helped that girl last time.

288
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,190
Can you go and find out the lottery numbers for me while we're at it and let me know,

289
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,980
and you go buy a ticket, too. That'd be so nice.

290
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,010
I'm home!

291
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,920
Do you know something?

292
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,550
Do you know that your very existence is a paragon?

293
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,930
The way you always keep books near you is so dashing. I want to model after that.

294
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,120
Wow. How is it that you can fill the universe with just one watch?

295
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,020
Art is sitting on your wrist.

296
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,250
So this is why I'm saying this, but do you by chance know this week's winning lottery numbers?

297
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,890
Why do you need to know the winning numbers?

298
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,590
If I know the winning numbers, I might find time to remove the sword.

299
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,820
4, 10, 14, 15, 18, 22.

300
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,720
Thank you.

301
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,650
You startled me!

302
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,390
Were you following me?

303
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,090
I'm tracking you.  You revealed a profound secret.

304
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,830
That grandmother is fine. She was very nice when she was alive so she deserves this much.

305
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,670
What's the use of a ghost knowing the winning numbers?

306
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,260
She said she's going to show up in her children's dreams and let them know the winning numbers.

307
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,630
If that's all, I'm going to the library then. The college exam is  approaching.

308
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,360
I want 10 tickets.

309
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,720
Minors cannot buy lottery tickets.

310
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,760
What? That's nonsense!

311
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,880
There is definitely a law like that, student.

312
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,730
I will take 10 tickets.

313
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,710
Show me your identity card.

314
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,650
Mister, this is a secret, but I'm only telling you because this is such a big deal.

315
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,110
There are guardians in this world.

316
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,130
So right now, you are meeting your guardian.

317
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,580
You have to believe me!

318
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Mister...

319
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,400
These are the winning numbers for today's lotto drawing.

320
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,980
So I will give you money to buy the tickets and then we can split it in half.

321
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,490
Deal?

322
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,160
Get out!

323
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:05,020
It's true! I'm serious! I don't have time.

324
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,800
Is this the library?

325
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,690
This is the last store on the way to the library, so I stopped by to buy milk.

326
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,260
You didn't buy milk, but lottery tickets.

327
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,940
How come you know everything all the time?

328
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,140
That's right. I was trying so hard to get them, but I couldn't. Happy now?

329
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,940
I don't even know if grandmother's son bought it or not.

330
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,290
He didn't buy it. He doesn't even have time to sleep because he has to work, so he wasn't able to have a dream.

331
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,790
Then what do we do? You should have made him fall  asleep!

332
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,930
It was a hard year for his farm. It only rained in Seoul. Only in Seoul!

333
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm not the one who controls all of the rainfall.

334
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,490
What are you talking about?

335
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,700
There will be no winner this week, so the winning will be carried over.

336
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,320
So what does that mean?

337
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,700
They are a nice and hardworking couple. They will probably have a very strange dream.

338
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,670
This one's on me.

339
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,560
Really?

340
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,590
Then... will you help them win next week?

341
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
You are a little cool.

342
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,300
You still won't be able to buy the ticket next week. Why are you happy?

343
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,990
It's not like I will never be able to buy it.

344
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,550
I will turn 20 in 2 months. Saturday comes every week, and Saturday nights are nice.

345
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,910
Lottery ticket! Goblin! Bang!

346
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,080
Pretend you don't know me. Geez...

347
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,390
Wow, they are all correct.

348
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,600
They're all correct!

349
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,790
Are you okay, Mister?

350
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:48,540
Really? Oh, thank you! I'm so thankful.

351
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,500
I will let Mister know.

352
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,260
How come these days I don't see the girl who lived at the hostel?

353
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,040
Thanks to you, she went up there.

354
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,320
She sorted out all her deep sorrows.

355
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,960
Then, grandmother, too...

356
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,710
Darling, you, too... Together with Goblin...

357
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,950
you should live happily. Okay?

358
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,850
Cheers!

359
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,510
Mister, when I die can I meet God?

360
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,040
Why do you ask?

361
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,360
I want to demand an explanation.

362
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,120
It seems like the goblin is such a lonely guardian.

363
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,030
People are probably not aware of it.

364
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:14,000
When people become distanced from the world, someone nudges you towards it.

365
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,100
But I know.

366
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,600
That's why I plan to remove the Goblin's sword for him.

367
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,260
What did you say?

368
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,290
So that he will become pretty without the sword and become a guardian that shines even more.

369
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,050
Hey, Eun Tak. No, miscellaneously omitted. You are in no position to worry about someone else.

370
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:37,190
Once you lose your value, you could get kicked out. Are you fine with that?

371
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,510
It's not like any of these are mine.

372
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:46,270
Life is just a brief borrowing and a brief stay anyway.

373
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,260
Hell doesn't only exist in hell.

374
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,400
Where is your mom's insurance money?

375
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,390
Stop talking and just bring it here if you don't want to explode.

376
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,410
This is how you pay me back for raising you?

377
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,260
This way? This way?

378
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,850
Since I've moved here I've been happy every day. It's as if I'm seeing a little bit of heaven.

379
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,370
That's why I want to pay back.

380
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,010
I'm not sure what he means when he says he will become pretty,

381
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,600
but when I see how you encourage me to pull the sword out,

382
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,540
I'm certain it's something good for him.

383
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,180
Hello, Grandmother!

384
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,030
Don't suffer anymore.

385
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,620
You hurt too much. Your mom is worried.

386
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,170
Good boy.

387
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,400
When I'm reborn,

388
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,080
can I be Kim Tae Hee?

389
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,870
Am I crazy? Why would I want to meet you again in my next life?

390
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,560
To be honest, I'm sick of you.

391
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,460
You bastard!

392
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:41,330
Where will I be going now?

393
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,170
You can just walk back through the door you came in.

394
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,530
Afterlife is a U-turn.

395
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,850
Happy?

396
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,730
Is that you, Happy?

397
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,160
It seems he felt bad for going first, so he's been waiting for you since earlier.

398
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,060
Happy will know the way.

399
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,900
Loans 100% Absolutely Possible 
 Team Leader Kim Mi Yeong

400
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,090
Kim Mi Yeong...

401
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,310
is a team leader.

402
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,540
These footsteps...

403
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,600
What do I do?

404
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,060
What to do? Kim Mi Yeong...

405
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,570
Geez....

406
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,510
Why in the world does he not answer his phone?

407
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,170
I can't meet him or get him on the phone. What exactly does he do for a living?

408
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,620
I'm a Grim Reaper.

409
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,650
Grim Reapers can only do as they're told.

410
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,320
Even if the person I believe is called Sun Hee...

411
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,580
may be Sunny to others.

412
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,830
Should I kill this jerk?

413
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,590
So annoying! He hurt my pride!

414
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,530
He makes me obsess over him this way? He's the kind of a man that will cause someone to get ill.

415
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,570
Just you wait until I get a hold of you!

416
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,890
What was that? It scared me!

417
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,200
Your order is here. Please enjoy!

418
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,390
Thank you.

419
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,090
Did something happen?

420
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,020
Part-Timer, do you believe in things like ghosts?

421
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,420
Pardon?

422
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,600
No way! Boss, you're so... ! There are no such things as ghosts!

423
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,860
Right? There are no such things as ghosts, right?

424
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,600
Of course not. People who say they've seen ghosts, they made that up!

425
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,880
But... what's the matter?

426
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,990
It's nothing. I experienced something a little strange.

427
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,510
That's that, but Part-Timer, don't come to work for the time being.

428
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,040
- Why not? 
 - I saw the news that the entrance exam is coming up.

429
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,950
Focus on that and get a 100 on it!

430
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,750
If I get a 100, I can't go to college, Boss. (500 = perfect score)

431
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,450
Really?

432
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:30,200
Then get a few wrong. A few that are the most difficult to answer.

433
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,600
Okay.

434
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,450
Think about it until I return from work, what I want.

435
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,450
What I might want the most is for you to be happy.

436
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,850
If that's what she wants more than anything, it puts me in a tough position...

437
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,930
Life is walking towards me.

438
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,110
Death...

439
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,700
is walking towards me.

440
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,530
To life, to death...

441
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,470
You are...

442
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,080
walking toward me without tiring out.

443
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,560
Then I...

444
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,730
say these words.

445
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,830
I am not sad.

446
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,880
This is enough for me...

447
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,290
It is...

448
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,400
enough...

449
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,860
What are you doing here?

450
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,650
Don't you see me?

451
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,400
I saw.

452
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,690
- What? 
 - You coming toward me.

453
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,860
Oh, for that long? I am a little touched.

454
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,860
But, when you watch for that long, is there anything different?

455
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,950
Or is it just always the same?

456
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,980
What is?

457
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,290
You said it to me before that you can't see mine (future).

458
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,190
20 years of age, 30....

459
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,900
Is it still like that with me?

460
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,560
Yes,

461
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,320
I cannot see yours.

462
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,000
Usually, I can at least see good, bad, fortune and misfortune.

463
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,660
I see.

464
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,580
I guess it's because I'm a miscellaneously omitted.

465
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,550
I was an uninteresting being, but it looks like I've become special,

466
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,290
since my future will be what I make of it.

467
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,880
Don't worry. It is not like I am always sick.

468
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Now I am a strong Goblin's bride who's living her life bravely while accepting her fate.

469
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,040
But, I am kind of curious.

470
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,970
About what?

471
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,360
Me at age 20, at age 30...

472
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:29,680
You will keep growing up like this.

473
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,720
What?

474
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,170
Continue on like now, prettily...

475
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,950
How do you know? I could be ugly one or two days.

476
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,850
It could be one or two months, too.

477
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:53,200
But... when you're being a guardian,

478
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,830
do you have a standard you go by?

479
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,060
I don't.

480
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,180
Just, it depends on my mood each day.

481
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,070
If I have to choose between adults or children, I usually help the children.

482
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:13,700
It was a child's hand which held me at the beginning

483
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,420
when I was falling apart from the world.

485
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:25,820
Please accept me.

486
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,770
From now on, I will attend to you.

487
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,110
I see...

488
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,860
Then why did you help my mother?

489
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,000
My mother was an adult.

490
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,100
At that time, I was drunk so my heart was weak.

491
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,430
And the person your mother asked for me to save wasn't herself.

That you were the one who answered my mother's plea...

494
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,370
seems like such a miracle...

495
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,790

Those one or two days that you are ugly.

Seriously...

515

Stop right there, huh?

00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,170
If someone teaches you something...

517
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,910
Wow, what is this?

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,620
Tree.

519
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,350
That's not what I was asking. Did you do this?

520
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:53,410
Figured I would do some pruning and cut some things off...

521
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,420
With those delicate hands, you did all of this yourself?

522
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah.

523
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:03,260
These two hands need some rest. Then...

524
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,620
Mister,

525
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,800
I am sorry that I only thought of myself all this time.

526
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,130
I was worried that you would kick me out,

527
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:20,060
and it was also fun seeing you beg and complain because I wouldn't pull it out for you.

528
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,870
And I also was worried that you would go meet other women once you became pretty.

529
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
You are not going to say it's not true?

530
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,280
- Do I have to? 
 - Petty.

531
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,160
I didn't expect you to. Anyway, I've now made my decision.

532
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,190
I will make you pretty.

533
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,760
There's no way that a good person like Mister's request could result in a bad outcome.

534
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,210
Where do you want to become pretty? In front of a pretty tree?

535
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,560
- Now? 
- Yes,  Why?

536
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,590
- Today? Right away?
 - Yes, it's not good to procrastinate.

537
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:59,300
I have a phone call. Someone's calling me. Hello, yes, I am coming right now!

538
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:06,160
Oh, you are holding the phone upside down...

539
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,350
What? Did you die?

540
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,790
I am rehearsing. Is there anything to drink?

541
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,000
What happened?

542
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,630
She said she would pull out the sword.

543
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,570
She doesn't know exactly what that means, right?

544
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,730
I couldn't tell her.

545
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,420
She seems to like me a lot. It's worrisome.

546
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,840
Are you asking to have a laugh or trying to fight?

547
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,960
You just don't know anything, but she likes me a lot.

548
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,960
As soon as we met, she said, "I love you. Let's get married."

549
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,090
Do you now how awkward she made me feel? You don't know anything.

550
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,830
There is no reason for her not to like me.

551
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,660
Why isn't there? The difference in age alone.

552
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,460
When she goes to university, it'll be overflowing with handsome young men.

553
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,700
900 years, so what?

554
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,930
Why do you always lessen your age when you're 939 years old?

555
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,070
Because I was born early in the year, I'm actually a year younger.

556
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:13,370
Ahh, I shouldn't laugh.

557
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,830
It's better than a drink.

558
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,030
Should I distance myself again?

559
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,490
She is the only one who can end my life,

560
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:35,180
but she keeps making me want to live. Isn't that funny?

561
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,200
Don't kid yourself.

562
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,800
You lived just fine, even when she wasn't around.

563
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,900
Really?

564
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,500
But why can't I remember how it was?

565
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:05,240
Mister are you a goblin? Mister are you really a guardian? Mister, you are a ghost, aren't you?

566
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,720
I am happy that I met mister.

567
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,170
From now on Mister, you won't leave, right?

568
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,800
I will get married to you, Mister.

569
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:18,580
Now, I will be upset when it rains because I will think you're sad.

570
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,610
Mister, who are you to decide my worth?

571
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,260
I don't need Mister, either.

572
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,620
Mister!

573
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:37,570
Red carpet, awesome. Mister did that, right? It was totally fascinating.

Please stop calling me, Ji Eun Tak.

579
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,060
Let me leave...

580
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,320

591
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,890
How can a student leave home? It's dangerous. Your aunt is worried. Hurry up and get in.

592
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,590
We're rough people. Hurry up and get in.

593
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,380
Stop.

594
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,560
What is it now?

595
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,960
Ahh, to your Hyungnim... Did you just step on my shadow?

596
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,790
Why? Does it hurt? You look like you want to hit me.

597
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:42,100
Say something. So that I can fight you for once as equals.

598
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,200
Ahh, this thing, really. Fine. Let's sue and report each other.

599
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,290
Let's take this all the way to court!

600
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,560
- This thing, I will just... ! 
 - What? You don't even know the law!

601
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,520
Do you know those loan sharks?

602
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,330
Oh, you starled me!

603
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,540
Hello.

604
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,200
Anybody sometimes knows a few loan...

605
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,980
What I am talking about? Because I'm surprised.

606
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,210
Do you know who I am?

607
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,440
It is not that I know you, I saw you. You were tailing Oppa Deok Hwa.

608
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,090
Ahh.

609
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,610
But how do you know those were loan sharks?

610
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,540
In the past, I was once a loan shark.

611
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,530
What?

612
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:26,730
I guess Deok Hwa will be late? Let's go with my car.

613
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,660
What kind of grown-up loan sharks fight in front of an all-girls high school?

614
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,470
Hello, you're working hard. I'm in front of the girls high school.

615
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,360
He's a fascinating person...

616
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,090
- What's the matter with you?

617
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,330
- Ah, this thing. 
 - Stop! Cut it out!

618
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,070
Where do you think you are? Sit up straight.

619
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:52,660
So you fought? In front of the girls' high school for no special reason?

620
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,460
Yes.

621
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:57,620
Every time he drives, he goes there. It's all your fault, punk.

622
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,860
Then you should have stopped me before I got there. Why are you b******ing at me now?

623
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,590
See this? He makes me angry.

624
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:09,340
I, too, am about to get angry, so answer me, huh? Why did you fight? Why?

625
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,730
Aren't you on the same side?

626
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:19,150
Yes.  But we end up fighting with each other all the time.

627
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,360
Last time we fought, too, and ended up at the hospital for two weeks.

628
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,300
But... we fought again as soon as we got discharged.

629
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,020
We don't bother anyone else since we only fight each other.

630
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,310
These punks, are you joking around right now?

631
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,120
That's what I mean! It's no joke how we fight!

632
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,230
 You fought each other. For your information, you will never be able to get along.

633
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,790
What is this?

634
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,820
We're not joking...

635
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,420
Oppa Deok Hwa is really nice.

636
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,130
He's kind and friendly and keeps his promises well.

637
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:12,770
He's very dependable and unlike a 3rd generation Chaebol, he's down-to-earth and simple.

638
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,520
I see.

639
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,720
Yes.

640
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,370
And he also tells me things that give me strength day to day.

641
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:22,580
For example?

642
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,050
I'm sorry.

643
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,870
I see.

644
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:39,590
♬ (humming) Pick me, pick me, pick me up.

645
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,620
I'm home.

646
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:43,390
That, I taught him that. About eye contact in front of a woman.

647
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,610
Something's going on with Mr. Goblin these days, right?

648
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:05,510
I don't know. He said he can't remember anything about his past.

649
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,390
What kind of things about his past?

650
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:13,270
Did he leave his memories with me? How would I know his thoughts?

651
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,430
I feel like you know...

652
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:23,350
I don't know. Just peel the garlic. Before I call out your name three times.

653
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,840
I'm sorry.

654
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:34,230
Even a hundred years ago, I had to call out the name three times. Now it's convenient. Just calling it out once does it.

655
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,900
That line of work must be hard, too.

656
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,120
Because of whom do you guess that my job has been difficult, "Miscellaneously Omitted?"

657
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,700
Should I peel all the garlic myself?

658
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,300
Goblin, he was early-born (born Jan. to Feb. gets grouped with those born the year before ) so he says he's actually a year younger.

659
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,300
Pardon?

660
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:03,180
This is all I can tell you. Good luck.

661
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,460
But...

662
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:15,150
when you and I first met, I was 9 years old.

663
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,460
And then when we met again it was 19 years of age.

664
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:26,560
Let's say that we met when I was 9 because of my mom. But how did you find me when I was 19?

665
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:34,670
9, 19, 29...

666
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:38,620
The moment right before completion is when it's the most dangerous.

667
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:41,600
What are you talking about... ?

668
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,060
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

669
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,840
Yes.

670
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:53,770
You will meet a grim reaper when you are 29, too. Even if it's not me.

671
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:59,850
That's the fate of the miscellaneously omitted. The world needs order.

672
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:07,380
and nine is the closest number to God's perfect number 10  and is incomplete..

673
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:11,520
Good luck with that, too.

674
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,280
Why are you looking at me like that? What secret are you talking about?

675
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,590
I dreamed well that day. Ah, I could have gotten a special promotion...

676
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:26,180
What are you saying? Oh, laundry.

677
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,280
You finish the rest yourself.

678
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,660
Mister.

679
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,400
What?

680
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,670
I can't tell exactly who is in a hurry. Do you see me now?

681
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,460
Yeah.

682
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,590
By chance, are you mad at me about something?

683
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,390
Why do you ask?

684
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:07,930
If you're not mad then why are you acting mad? How far back are you going to get mad about?

685
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:10,860
Why do I feel like you're mad at me for all of your accumulated anger?

686
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,860
When did I do that?

687
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,740
Right now, too, you're angry at me.

688
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,380
Who do you think you are?

689
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,400
Exactly who are you that you keep calling me and causing a disturbance?

690
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,830
Why do you keep flustering me and confusing me? Who are you, too?

691
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,000
It would have been nice if you pulled out the sword when I asked. Since that's your worth.

692
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,420
But I...

693
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:41,530
So, I told you I would pull the sword out for you.

694
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:45,880
The one who didn't talk to me or answer was you.

695
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,160
I thought maybe you were waiting for the first snow. Since that was what we first agreed on.

696
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:58,380
Never mind. Since you live forever, maybe you have plenty of time to waste; but because I'm an ordinary human being,

697
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:05,400
time is gold and money. Until when do I have to be on standby? I'm busy too with school and work.

698
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,000
Tomorrow.

699
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,190
Why not today? I have time today.

700
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:14,030
Tomorrow. I don't want it to be today. The weather's too nice today.

701
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,670
I'm going to go for a walk with you.

702
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,810
Tomorrow.

703
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:26,120
What is it now? Let's just do it before I leave for school.

704
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,260
The weather is bad today. I have to come pick you up later.

705
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:39,470
Tomorrow. Just one more day.

706
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:42,490
Why not today again?

707
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:44,590
Just one more day...

708
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,690
Does he think I'd do it for free?

709
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,250
Master...

710
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,930
Be well...

711
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,460
I will follow you soon.

712
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:06,360
The fact that I'm going without finding those who I owe so much to, you could say it's my deep regret.

713
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:11,630
This picture, please burn it for me.

714
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,620
Master...

715
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:24,510
My young bride, even when I'm gone,

716
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:29,390
so that she'll eat well, learn well, and live well,

717
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:39,090
that is your last duty.

718
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:45,360
I will do as you ask, Master.

719
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,300
Master...

720
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,880
Please...

721
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,220
Card... !

722
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:11,270
Are you really giving t-this to me, Uncle?

723
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:18,270
Don't be upset anymore that you don't have a card and live freely, Deok Hwa.

724
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,400
- It's a reward from me.
 - A reward?

725
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,730
Why am I getting a reward? I didn't do anything to be rewarded for.

726
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,670
You worked hard at growing up well.

727
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,670
I love you.

728
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,940
This kid...

729
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,210
I put the deed to the house in your room.

730
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,820
This is really your house now.

731
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,720
Please live long and well.

732
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,790
And I have a request.

733
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,650
When I disappear, that child's mark will disappear, too.

734
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,610
Then at that time

735
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,890
please erase her memory

736
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:19,720
so that she won't blame herself.

737
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,830
What did you say? Speak up!

738
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:26,410
It's so noisy, I couldn't hear you!

739
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,220
Put your headphone in!

740
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:44,120
I'm holding it away from my ear! I can at least see your face!

741
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,590
Ah... hey...

742
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,050
Let's hang up. I'm hanging up for your benefit.

743
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,150
If you need to call me, text me first.

744
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,870
I can't see your face! Are you holding it against your ear? Hello?

745
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,320
It's nice to go for a walk with you.

746
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:30,560
♬  Iy's a beautiful life, I will be with you  ♬

747
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,140
It's nice to come pick you up.

748
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,950
♬ It's a beautiful life  ♬

749
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,890
♬ I will stand behind you ♬

750
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,890
When did you come home?

751
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:45,290
It's nice to look at you.

752
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,620
Why are you being so nice to me these days? I'm getting suspicious.

753
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,460
Give me your hand for a second.

754
01:04:53,260 --> 01:05:01,270
♬  Just breathing is good  ♬

755
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:05,470

♬   Beautiful your heart  ♬

761
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:28,460
What does that word mean?

762
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:34,200
♬   It's a beautiful life  ♬

763
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,670
"Cheong," as in "to hear."

764
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,450
Ah, "cheong," as in "to hear?"

765
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,000
♬  It's a beautiful life  ♬

766
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,230
Thank you.

767
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,440
Ahjussi, good night.

768
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,960
♬   Sorrowful life, sorrowful day ♬

770
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:07,200

01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,050

772
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:20,620
♬   So that I won't have to live in memories  ♬

773
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,110
Nice. Now all I have to do is translate it.

774
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:27,910
♬ It's a beautiful life  ♬

775
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,930
Why can't I translate it?

776
01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:13,370
I'm sure there's a clue in here somewhere!

777
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:17,340
I'm coming in for a second.

778
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,170
Oh, okay.

779
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:28,020
Awesome! What are all these?

780
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:33,750
I thought you might need them when you become an adult.

781
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:40,140
The $5,000, you'll figure that out well on your own.

782
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:44,120
And this is for when you get into college and have a boyfriend.

783
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,100
For when you go on dates. Prettily.

784
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,130
Why are you giving these to me all of a sudden?

785
01:07:57,470 --> 01:08:00,030
Oh, it smells nice.

786
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,860
- Today. 
 - Today what?

787
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,350
Sword.

788
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:07,070
Right now?

789
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:08,910
In the middle of the night?

790
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:11,110
Yeah. Now.

791
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:17,760
Okay. Just five minutes.

792
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,420
But...

793
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:31,040
could love be among these things, too?

794
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,090
No.

795
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:44,190
I was just asking. I'll be right out.

796
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,110
Wow!

797
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:58,420
There's always a cool place behind your door!

798
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,760
It's my first time seeing a buckwheat field. It's pretty.

799
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:10,080
By chance, did the flowers you gave me come from here, too?

800
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:14,290
I still remember the meaning of those flowers.

801
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,990
Lovers.

802
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:24,420
But this must be a very special place. Seeing how you have to get the sword pulled out here.

803
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,920
My beginning and end.

804
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,290
I will ask this of you.

805
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,940
Right now? Right away?

806
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:41,390
W-Wait a minute. I'm all for you becoming pretty.

807
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,760
But after you become pretty, there's no more use for me

808
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,930
was what I was thinking; so, I wrote down a few things.

809
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:55,680
 [A and B's effective value...]

810
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:02,240
Instead of studying like I expected, this is what you've been doing?

811
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,610
You have to read the last condition, too.

812
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:10,640
B will respond to A's summons on the first day it snows each year. 

813
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,220
Since A will be waiting.

814
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,140
You're really going to die?

815
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,850
Before the first snow falls. 

816
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,080
 If the first snow falls...   Why?

817
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,940
I don't want to ruin her first snow.

818
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,230
This is why you asked my name?

819
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,170
No. I was actually curious about that.

820
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:41,190
Goes together nicely. You and your name.

821
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:49,120
You know what I mean, right?

822
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,640
It means this.

823
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,110
How did you know? It's really hard to understand.

824
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,700
Awesome.

825
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,040
It's snowing.

826
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,430
It's the first snow, Ahjussi. But how is it snowing already?

827
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:27,400
It's amazing.

828
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,470
I love it since it's pretty, but the flowers must be cold.

829
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:36,490
Right? We're enjoying the earliest snow fall in the world.

830
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:42,630
But this is your doing, right? You said the sword will be pulled out on the first day of snow. It's that, right?

831
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,020
I'm sorry for being selfish,

832
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,110
but I wanted to have at least one of this kind of memory.

833
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,040
But how long are you going to take to keep this memory? You have to hurry up and become pretty.

834
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,840
Yes. Now.

835
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,660
Now, then let's become pretty.

836
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,080
And your last words?

837
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:18,680
The time I shared with you was all blindingly bright

838
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,380
Because the day was good...

839
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,060
Because the day was npt good ...

840
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,510
Because the day was just right ...

841
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,220
I loved each and every day.

842
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,950
Also,

843
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:45,110
no matter what happens,

844
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,050
it's not your fault.

845
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:52,520
Mister, by chance...

846
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:59,030
are you really turning into a broom?

847
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,420
Nothing of the kind will happen.

848
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:07,970
That's a relief. Then now I'm going to pull it out.

849
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:43,030
But... why can't I grab it?

850
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:46,010
I can see it, so why can't I pull it out?

851
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,080
Did you put enough strength in your hands?

852
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:54,490
Wait a minute, let me try one more time.

853
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:15,240
What you definitely said earlier no matter what happens is not my fault

854
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,970
- can't be taken back. 
 - Hey, so you're...

855
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:21,110
- so you're not the Goblin's bride--
 - -I said you can't take it back!

856
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,240
So stand still! I'm the one who's more flustered.

857
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,700
Hey! I am standing still! How can I be more still? Hey, give me that note so I can burn it.

858
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,630
Hold on!

859
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,160
I got it. I think this is that thing. I know that.

860
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,550
- What is it? 
 - The prince in a fairytale. The cursed prince. That.

861
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,810
What about that?

862
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,110
The kiss.

863
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,600

♬  Because of all the painful memories, I erased you  ♬

865
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:16,190
♬   Because your love pains me I erased it all  ♬

866
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:23,780
♬   My love, don't abandon me  ♬

867
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:30,600
♬   My love, I am by your side   ♬

868
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,810
So I grabbed the sword,

869
01:15:33,810 --> 01:15:37,150
but this thing, I could see it but I couldn't pull it out.

870
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:38,830
He somehow managed to come back alive...

871
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,780
I don't think she's the Goblin's bride, so I think she should leave!

872
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,620
- Why the business card? 
 - I want to have one.

873
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,740
Isn't this Kim Woo Bin's phone?

874
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:48,350
- I can't answer because I don't have a business card.
 - What do you want me to do about it?

875
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,700
- What do you like, Woo Bin? 
 - Sunny.

876
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:54,150
Of course, it was my first kiss, but...

877
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,080
- Are you okay? 
 - Oppa Tae Hee?

878
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,550
Who's Tae Hee? Come out.

879
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,120
Who are you?

880
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,950
♬  When I close my eyes, those eyes appear ♬

881
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:19,450
♬  Because my heart keeps aching, I was hoping to forget    ♬
