14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,690
Goblin

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,560
Yeah. That's why I'm saying this.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,490
Episode 16

17
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm saying this because the day is good enough.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,260
I'm saying this because you continue to be blindingly bright.

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm saying this because all those first loves were you.

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,080
On another good enough day, will you become the bride of this Goryeo man?

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:26,280
♬ How can I get over you?  ♬

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,150
♬ Why do we have to be   ♬

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,310
♬ apart?  ♬

24
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:01,440
I will. I will be the bride of this lonely man.

25
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:09,480
I will be the first and last bride of this radiant man.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,530
I will surely be.

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,550
♬ And we come again  ♬

28
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,830
♬ from the place we have never known ♬

29
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,390
♬ There are too many shadows  ♬

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,120
♬ Of your love everywhere around me  ♬

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:41,390
♬ Stuck, stuck, stuck in love  ♬

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,590
Mom, I'm getting married. I'll live happily.

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,810
You must've met the Goblin. You're getting married, too. Good for you.

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,330
Why am I tearing up?

35
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,210
- Unni? 
 - Huh?

36
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,120
- Can you see us? 
 - Yes.

37
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,630
Wow! How long has it been? How have you been?

38
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,710
Girl! You see us now!

39
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,620
Jeez. Have you been doing well?

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:35,830
I was lonely. Come with me.

41
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,930
I'll do better than the Goblin.

42
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,370
Stay here for a sec. I have a bag of salt over there!

43
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at you with your temper.

44
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,430
Congratulations on your marriage!

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,910
Congratulations.

46
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,230
Yeah!

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,700
Drink it. It'll help you forget this life's memories.

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,260
T-Thank you.

49
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,860
What kind of nonsense is this? How can I be served with my chauffeur?

50
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,230
How can I drink the same thing?

51
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,360
In here, everybody gets the same cup of tea.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,970
What bullshit is that? I'm still mad that I'm dead.

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,910
How can you treat me the same way as that life that's not even worth this watch?

54
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,210
Like I said, here everybody gets the same cup of tea.

55
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,580
Your watch has already stopped and anything that you have

56
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,060
won't be able to cross that door.

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,320
Did you live as a strong man in your life? But as you go behind that door, you'll realize....

58
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,810
You sin with your eyes, sin with your mouth,

59
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,670
sin with your hands and feet, sin with your heart. How strong can they be?

60
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,360
How far deep down to Hell that will pull you.

61
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,890
You really don't want to go on a blind date?

62
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,360
I told you I don't like a chef.

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,370
He's not the chef. This time, it's my client.

64
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:31,040
He's a chaebol. He's rich. He's handsome. Above all, he's young.

65
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,840
He likes older ladies. His request isn't something weird, either.

66
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,050
It's something with his inheritance. What do you think?

67
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,440
Blind date?

68
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,840
What the... it's new.

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,850
What's going on?

70
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,550
I shouldn't be just waiting here.

71
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,750
Ji Eun Tak!

72
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,320
What should we listen to? The newbie?

73
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,220
Sure.

74
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,900
Can I help you?

75
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,330
I'm PD Ji Eun Tak's boyfriend.

76
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,490
I'm her fiance, to be exact. How about we get married this weekend?

77
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,900
Wow.

78
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,480
Oh, should we grab lunch first? Let's go.

79
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,700
Are we expecting someone?

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,370
Deok Hwa. You should properly greet him.

81
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,160
Oh, right. You think he won't recognize me because I aged too much?

82
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,550
No way.

83
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,670
Aunty, give me one spicy.

84
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,630
He's here.

85
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,710
What is this? With this formal feast and a couple.

86
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:05,740
- I get it. I get it. 
 - Yes, we're getting married.

87
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,610
Wow.

88
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,990
Do you prefer Saturday or Sunday?

89
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,000
Why are you acting this way?

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,770
Then do you prefer lunchtime or dinnertime?

91
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,640
I like Sunday dinner. Saturday is party day.

92
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,010
Why are you like this?

93
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,590
You're asking me? This way you won't go on a blind date. With a chaebol. A handsome chaebol.

94
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,380
Above all, a younger chaebol.

95
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,090
What are you talking about?

96
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,700
I'm the only one in the country to meet all the criteria. Don't worry. You're not my style.

97
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,120
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoo Deok Hwa.

98
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,410
Yes, I've heard a lot about you. I'm Ji Eun Tak.

99
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,670
Wow, he became the team leader, now.

100
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,970
Ji Eun Tak? That old letter, Ji Eun Tak? Who knows my building, Ji Eun Tak?

101
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,380
You still have a lot you don't know, huh?

102
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,510
- Enjoy your food. 
 - Thank you.

103
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,610
But, do you know what my uncle is to marry—

104
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,000
A goblin. Doesn't everybody know one goblin?

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,640
- Of course. 
 - Amazing.

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,320
You know my building. You know my uncle. What is this?

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,100
Why am I the only one who doesn't know?

108
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,400
Here. Eat and grow up. You'll know when you grow up.

109
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,300
Me, too.

110
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,320
If you do a blind date...

111
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll be a married lady soon.

112
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,120
She said a married lady.

113
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,420
Where do you live?

114
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
I told you you're not my style.

115
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,910
Do you like your job?

116
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,540
Uncle is getting married.

117
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,610
That's good news.

118
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,620
Yes. So I'm going to get married before he does.

119
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,330
That's even better news.

120
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,860
Right? I'll raise a lot of kids and I'll make sure to make a lot of siblings.

121
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,580
That's more than I could wish for. But Deok Hwa...

122
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,270
- You can't get married alone. 
 - I have a lot of girls.

123
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,740
Exactly. You can't have a lot in that matter.

124
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,230
Oh.

125
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,700
Was there anyone that your heart beat just by thinking of her?

126
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,740
Was there anyone whom you teared up over if you didn't see her?

127
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,040
Can you think of anyone whom you could die on behalf of?

128
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:31,800
Not yet. How about you? Have you thought about getting married?

129
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
- No. 
 - Why not?

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,870
Because I'm already married and have three kids. I married someone like that.

131
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,230
What? Really? Why didn't I know?

132
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,340
- Because I never told you. 
 - Why didn't you tell me?

133
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,450
Because you never asked.

134
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,440
You don't care about the world and people around you yet, right?

135
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,920
That's why I'm waiting for your questions. An adult's questions.

136
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,340
About the world. About the happiness and sadness of the people around you.

137
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:18,750
Thank you. Just wait for me a little longer. I'll work hard to grow up.

138
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,700
I will.

139
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,910
Wow, how can you tell everybody without my permission?

140
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,840
Whoa! Keep your eyes on the road! A car on the left!

141
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,120
Why? Are you nervous?

142
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,750
No. Seeing you drive makes you look like a real adult... The line! The steering wheel!

143
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,170
- Hold on to the steering wheel! 
 - I see it all.

144
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,260
I know! I know! I'm just amazed!

145
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,590
It's my first time on the passenger side. Turn left.

146
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:56,370
- Oh, left turn. 
 - Left turn! Left! Left!

147
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,450
Seriously! Where are we going to?

148
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,840
Turn on the blinker when you turn. All the time!

149
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,250
♬  I’m wasting my word. Wasting my time   ♬

150
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,760
♬  I will give you everything  ♬

151
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,950
You're so pretty.

152
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,200
You're pretty dandy, too, Mr. Kim Shin.

153
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,810
It's not a day or two (that I've been dandy).

154
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,090
Let's have the wedding with a bowl of sacred water. Mysteriously.

155
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,480
Okay.

156
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,880
♬  You wake up my heart. And walk to my world  ♬

157
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,230
♬  I call you a miracle. Out of everything that breathes  ♬

158
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,940
Is it a present?

159
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,320
It's a wedding watch.

160
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,430
He's got a pretty wrist. I'll take this one.

161
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,700
♬  I want to keep you close to me ♬

162
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,900
♬  She blew me away  ♬

163
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:25,060
♬  Heaven is in your eyes. Heaven is in your sound  ♬

164
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:31,790
♬  It's everything in the world you show me  ♬

165
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,300
♬  Heaven is in your kiss.  Even though tears fall down  ♬

166
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,950
♬  You are the only one under this heaven ♬

167
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,510
♬  My smile is the only one under this heaven  ♬

168
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,070
All the streets that we'll walk together... All the views that we'll look at together...

169
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,270
 All the questions and answers we'll ask and answer bashfully and passionately,.

170
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,050
In all of those moments, I love you.

171
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,060
From your bride.

172
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,850
Then we will listen to the music and be back with the listener's story.

173
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,290
Cue.

174
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:19,120
What is this? There's no subject. Is it a love letter written at night?

175
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,350
What is it? I like love letters.

176
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,380
You must.

177
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,740
"To you who thought that my oblivion would be me being at peace,

178
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,830
I knew the moment I saw your eyes, that you have been cherishing all the memories."

179
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,070
Use this story. It's the PD's prerogative. I will be going out for a while.

180
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,960
Hey, PD Ji! This is a live broadcast!

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,200
I pray that in the next life, we would have a fate in which the wait is short and the meeting is long..

182
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,390
With faces we could meet without making excuses.

183
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,310
in the one and only ardent name in the world..

184
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,540
A relationship where we can run and greet each other when we meet coincidentally..

185
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,220
A person whose answer is always right.

186
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,240
I pray that we would meet like that.

187
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,090
t's fine since I saw your face

188
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:22,520
Sometimes, Kim Woo Bin. Sometimes,  Wang Yeo.

189
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,660
Please for a long time... stay well.

190
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,680
Goodbye..

191
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,870
She didn't only move but sold the whole building?

192
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,260
Yes. Last week. Miss, you're from the rooftop, right?

193
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,650
I even bought it with your lease. I heard you work in a broadcasting station.

194
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,240
Ah, yes. For now I am in a rush, I will see you next time.

195
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,730
Part-timer. I am leaving. Be well. Don't cry.

196
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,620
Eat a big bite of something. To you who lost your parents when you were little and all alone,

197
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,060
I wish I was a comfort even for a while.

198
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,980
I leave my stubborn Orabeoni in your care. Live together happily for a long time.

199
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,840
Goodbye.

200
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,310
She remembers everything.

201
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,260
Boss...

202
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,180
has left.

203
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,610
She remembers everything.

204
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,460
She protected those memories alone. She looked after me who had no memories of it.

205
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,530
She longed for her Orabeoni who was gone, so lonely like that.

206
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,150
But why do you think she left?

207
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,530
Because she could not forgive.

208
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,310
In this life... she chose not to see him again.

209
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:16,070
To the  Grim Reaper... there is no bigger punishment than that.

210
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,360
I will just count to 50 then go.

211
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,190
One.

212
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,090
Two.

213
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,970
Forty-seven.

214
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,320
Forty-eight.

215
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,380
Forty-nine.

216
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,790
One.

217
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,770
♫ I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you ♫

218
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,510
♫ I don’t know why my tears keep falling when I look at you ♫

219
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,080
Two.

220
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,900
Three.

221
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,950
♫ Were you coming back to me? ♫

222
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,820
I won't let you hear the news.

223
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,180
In this life...

224
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,620
I won't be able to see you again.

225
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,930
♫ I could feel that we are meant fated to be ♫

226
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,810
Just once...

227
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,260
can I hug you?

228
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,860
♫ You are my fated person ♫

229
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,360
♫ No matter how many times you’ll be born again, no matter where you’ll hide ♫

230
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,920
♫ I will find you ♫

231
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,800
♫ We should never part again ♫

232
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,950
♫ Don’t leave my side ♫

233
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,300
Be well.

234
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,640
Farewell.

235
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,180
♫  Don’t leave my side ♫

236
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,130
Like that... we said goodbye in this life.

237
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,530
The time I heard of her news...

238
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,470
was a long time after that.

239
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,260
I touched these vulgar things for you, how about eating it?

240
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,390
Even if the apple is shaped like a rabbit?

241
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,760
Sunny...

242
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,520
left.

243
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,050
That woman...

244
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,580
till the end...

245
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,210
goes well as always.

246
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,030
After you became like that, just in case, I held on to it not knowing what to do.

247
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,320
I should have returned this to you.

248
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm sorry it took so long.

249
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,820
It wasn't mine from the beginning.

250
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,120
It was your regret, guilt and longing. I think it's right for you to have it.

251
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,460
- But still, can I?
- Yeah.

252
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,340
If you eat this.

253
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,350
And also, thank you.

254
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,890
The ancestral tablet in the temple, the 9 years that I was gone

255
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,890
you lit the candle for it every year.

256
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,620
I don't know if I have the right to pay tribute to them,

257
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,320
but I want to face my sins.

258
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,290
I wish someone would tell us...

259
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,030
"It's enough."

260
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,880
"It's enough now."

261
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,360
I heard you wanted to see me.

262
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,380
I wanted to let you know of a secret.

263
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,690
A secret?

264
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,200
If you commit a huge crime, you would become a grim reaper.

265
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,290
What that sin is.

266
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,510
The great sin that we committed is the sin of throwing out our own lives.

267
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:53,530
Those who take their own lives are made into grim reapers.

268
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,750
Leading the ones to death, living as

269
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,230
an existence who is not living, nor dead.

270
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,920
What could be the reason?

271
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,580
One without a name, one without memories.

272
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,650
Needs a house,

273
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,830
needs something to eat, what do you think the reason is?

274
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,250
As I was looking for answers to those questions and suddenly one day

275
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,650
the things that we gave up on,

276
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,750
name, the life that we threw away,

277
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,140
would we want them back one day?

278
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,430
If we want life earnestly, won't our punishment end?

279
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,430
I know the reason why you are avoiding me.

280
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,490
Nine years ago, I had a hunch that you met Park Joong Hun.

281
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:59,720
That's why you know who I am and who you are.

282
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,340
And so...

283
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,210
I wanted to apologize. I borrowed your hands

284
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,470
and had a death that shouldn't have happened. I regret it.

285
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,160
And also... I ask for forgiveness.

286
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,150
So forget it all. Forget them and live.

287
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,110
See off the deceased for the last time, live as you atone.

288
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,310
I hope

289
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,300
you can forgive yourself, also.

290
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,540
The thing that God hopes for us is to forgive ourselves.

291
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,860
And realize an ardent life.

292
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,960
Aunt, eat.

293
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,440
Where are you going late at night?

294
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,590
The soup will get cold. Eat it.

295
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,820
Did you get yourself a man?

296
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,240
Oh my. You can't become a single mom like your mother.

297
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,900
Aunt, why do you have to say that?

298
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,200
Until when are you going to stay here?

299
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,910
I already set the table enough for you. You are now a ghost.

300
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,860
- It's not good to be wandering around too much.
- Where are you looking at with those eyes?

301
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,990
Hey.

302
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,540
I can't go like this. Since it's so unfair.

303
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:51,060
If I had that bankbook. If only you didn't take that bankbook!

304
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,230
I wouldn't have been like this on the streets!

305
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,790
Aunt, seriously, why are you like this? Must you be like this even in death?

306
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:09,790
You are answering back because you haven't been hit lately, huh?

307
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,450
I ought to... !

308
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,890
Ahjumma, whom are you laying your hands on right now? 
Do you know how much I cherish that child?

309
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,350
I ought to... break your wrist?

310
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,770
Hey! What are you? What is this crazy bitch doing?

311
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,040
To a sunbae, "Crazy?" This won't do.

312
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,060
Ahjumma, you need to come with me.

313
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,950
Come with me. It's because I'm lonely.

314
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,750
I have good chemistry with bad wenches.

315
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,450
Let go. Won't you let go? Do you know this bitch?

316
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,050
- Unni. 
- I think I found my travel buddy.

317
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,760
She will be a good sparring opponent on the lonely afterlife road.

318
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,660
Are you going?

319
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,310
It's about time.

320
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm thankful for all this time. Live well with the Goblin, girl.

321
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,780
Come, Ahjumma. Let's go.

322
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,720
Wait.

323
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,810
Aunt, thank you for raising me.

324
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:19,920
In the next life, let's meet with good fate.

325
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,180
Don't be funny! Why would I see you again?

326
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,280
Let go! Aren't you letting go? Let go!

327
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,220
Let go! Let go!

328
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,310
Welcome.

329
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,820
You're still doing it alone as usual. Where's Mr. Goblin?

330
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,020
I don't know. He said he's getting sacred water or something.

331
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,990
I asked to see you because I wanted to give you something.

332
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,400
Perhaps... did a name card arrive?

333
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,790
No. Not that.

334
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,540
So it's not. That startled me.

335
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,170
Are you worried that a name card might come?

336
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,540
Rather than being worried, I'm curious.

337
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,660
How my fate has changed.

338
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,350
Your fate has so many variables.

339
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,670
I know.

340
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,960
My birthmark is gone, the sword is pulled out,

341
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,200
and so I have lived with no scratches these past 9 years.

342
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,960
But... the truth that I am a Miscellaneous Omitted Person hasn't changed.

343
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,970
I was almost not born. I've lost someone I love from death.

344
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:59,450
At the very least, the one who is before me is a Grim Reaper.

345
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,910
And more than that, a human dies someday.

346
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,980
That's why life is more beautiful.

347
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,460
That's why, after my memories returned, the first thought I had was to live as if this were my last day.

348
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:27,590
If today is the last, then this memory would be the last memory of the one I love.

349
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,960
So, I should try hard to live and love every moment.

350
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,240
Know that your life is already beautiful.

351
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,410
What is it that you'll be giving me?

352
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,780
Here.

353
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,730
Wow!

354
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,240
Congratulations on your wedding, Goblin's bride.

355
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,560
Thank you.

356
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:35,710
Until death splits us apart. All of your words, whatever they are.

357
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,700
Me, too.

358
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:48,170
Even if death splits us apart. All your words, whatever they are, me, too.

359
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,470
- That must be delicious. 
- It's cooked well?

360
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,510
Should we do a few more?

361
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,200
Between 7 to 9 degrees is best for champagne.

362
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,320
Uncle down the hall!

363
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,510
I think I'm drunk without even drinking.

364
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,980
How can you be drunk already?

365
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,960
- One shot!
- What's with you, too?

366
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,260
Are you alright? You don't look too good.

367
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,790
I'm okay--

368
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,720
Okay. I got it to 7 degrees.

369
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,490
Would you like a glass?

370
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,640
If you would give...

371
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,920
CEO Kim! CEO Kim!

372
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,490
You should be careful!

373
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,880
You are all too careless and naive.

374
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,740
What is this? Why does this sound familiar?

375
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,250
Sing. Sing.

376
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,900
Sing.

377
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,820
No, how could I sing? I can't sing!

378
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:25,720
♬ In the middle of these many people

379
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,010
♬  Meeting you is so fortunate

380
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,100
♬ In the middle of this vast world

381
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,410
Altogether.

382
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:46,050
♬ Meeting you is a joy to me as well

383
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:52,960
♬ In the middle of all these people

384
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,550
I'm sleepy.

385
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,560
Good night.

386
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,880
I love you.

387
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,170
♬  It's a beautiful life  ♬

388
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,780
It's the last song. I hope everyone is happy.

389
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,370
Okay. You worked hard.

390
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,750
You worked hard.

391
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,370
Today's broadcast was really crazy.

392
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,200
We were right on time, the song selection was unbelievable, the message board from the listeners' reactions was good, too.

393
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,130
It's rarely this perfect.

394
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,380
You're going to make me feel arrogant.

395
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,480
Then... I will go off work after my meeting with the guest.

396
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,580
Okay.

397
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,360
- Work hard.
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

398
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,520
♬ It's a beautiful life. Beautiful day ♬

399
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,980
♬ I would live in your memory ♬

400
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,900
♬ Beautiful life. Beautiful day ♬

401
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,360
It seems like the kindergarten bus will be in an accident.

402
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,030
This seems to be the driver.

403
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:38,580
Now... I really think that this job is really a punishment.

404
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,290
I will take this call.

405
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,050
Mister.

406
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,490
Sunbaenim, it's from the registration team.

407
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,580
They said we should get rid of the name cards received for today.

408
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,570
The children's fate has been changed.

409
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,380
Is that so?

410
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,410
Why did it change?

411
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,840
Because of a certain death for which no name card arrives.

412
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,420
Is there also a death where a name card does not come?

413
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,640
What is that?

414
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,310
A death cannot be pre-detrmined.

415
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,230
A sacrifice.

416
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,850
Where are you? Why aren't you coming? It's a dangerous world.

417
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,520
Do you know what time it is?

418
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,020
It's 4 in the afternoon and I am on my way to a meeting.

419
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,930
Wait. I will turn right.

420
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,850
Right turn is on the right.

421
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,570
Ah, seriously.

422
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,620
Hello? Eun Tak.

423
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,760
Ji Eun Tak.

424
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,300
The kindergarten bus...

425
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,180
If I avoid it then those kiddos...

426
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,030
What? I can't hear you well. What happened?

427
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,290
I must be crazy. What am I doing now?

428
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,610
Now that I think about it, it was a perfect day.

429
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:48,280
When I woke up, I was in his embrace.

430
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,010
I made the fried egg perfectly, too. It was a satisfactorily live broadcast.

431
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:02,710
All of those perfections must have been to lead me to this moment.

432
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,230
So, I won't be late.

433
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,430
Hello? Where are you?

434
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,650
Ji Eun Tak, where are you?

435
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,180
It wouldn't have worked if I was late for a minute or second.

436
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,330
This was my destiny.

437
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,170
Good night.

438
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,870
I love you.

439
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,070
I do, too.

440
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,640
A human's sacrifice

441
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,430
is a domain that God cannot pre-determine and foresee.

442
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:16,840
That is a moment's instinct

443
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,670
and wholly a human's decision.

444
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,070
It's something only a human can decide on.

445
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,100
Ji Eun Tak. 29 years old. Accident.

446
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:42,370
Late... A name card has arrived.

447
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,300
To an awfully mean God's question, you gave an awfully sad answer,

448
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,960
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

449
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:22,260
Born on September 13, 1998. 29 years old.

450
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,340
Ji Eun Tak...

451
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,100
It's... you, right?

452
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,580
I was saying, "What am I doing?" but I was still doing it.

453
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:57,970
I was... really scared, Mister.

454
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,140
This afternoon,  when the brake was released on  a parked truck, the truck rolled

455
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,620
and killed a woman in her twenties.

456
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:12,020
That car must have absorbed the entire impact from the front. Oh no!

457
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:17,680
Wasn't it an angel? People like that I believe are angels.

458
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,840
If it weren't for her, a lot more people would have died.

459
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,460
So this is what Mr. Grim Reaper's workplace looks like.

460
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,680
It's really nice.

461
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:41,300
Mister, I have something I'm curious about. I heard that a person has four  lives.

462
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:49,770
Which life did I live? You can tell that to a deceased, can't you?

463
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,150
You... lived the first life.

464
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
That's a relief.

465
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,690
I have three left.

466
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,060
I will come with the tea. Go ahead and talk.

467
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,470
Do you...

468
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,420
remember what I said last time?

469
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:03,920
The person left... should live more diligently.

470
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,910
You'll cry from time to time, but you should laugh more

471
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,230
and energetically.

472
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:16,930
That is consideration for the love received.

473
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,850
How could... How could you do this to me...

474
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,170
I'm sorry.

475
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,210
I'm really sorry.

476
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:52,650
Look at me. Let me see your face.

477
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:59,660

478
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,930
Mister, you haven't granted one of the three wishes I had.

479
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,400
Can't you grant it to me now?

480
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:18,940
Don't hurt for a long time. I will come to meet you again so wait well.

481
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:25,070
Don't make it rain too much, since the citizens would be uncomfortable.

482
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:30,390
You said one but why are you saying three? How will I live without you?

483
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,300
I will be gone just for a little bit.

484
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,190
I promise.

485
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,460
This time... I will come.

486
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:48,400
I will certainly find you.

487
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,740
In the next life, I will be born full of life and stay for a long, long time by your side.

488
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,360
I will pester them when I go up there so that I can do that.

♫ You cried like rain ♫

525

That day, Miscellaneous Omitted Person... walked in someone's tears forever.

526
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:50,720
The time where one couldn't tell if it's night or day was washed down with the rain.

527
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,460
It was a very long rainy season.

528
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,390
In this world with no guardian god, Miscellaneous Omitted Person,

529
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,040
summoned the guardian god back and left.

530
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,970
A guardian god so lonely and radiant.

531
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,430
Her mom...

532
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,770
must have met her.

533
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,510
What is that pin? Don't say that you bought it yourself?

534
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,480
It's not me. It's my dad's taste.

535
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,240
Then you should wear it when your dad is here. Why wear it out?

536
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,780
I love my dad whether I see him or not,

537
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,170
so don't mind and shut up.

538
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,860
I don't even have a dad that would buy me a pin.

539
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:52,880
I don't know, that's why.

540
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,330
Hey... why take variety for a documentary (why take it so seriously)?

541
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,240
What are you looking at, Ahjumma?

542

Kids these days are scary.

I know that everyone is like that at your age.

546
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,250
But at your age,

547
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,630
you don't have to be like that.

548
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,620
It's just that you guys are lovable,

549
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,590
I was looking, thinking, "How could they be so lovable?"

550
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,120
I'm sorry.

551

You must have loved her a lot.

I'm not sure.

could possibly be the last.

00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,170
Your brother is here. Outside.

638
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,590
As usual, you don't even care about your brother.

639
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,320
Like this...

640
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,880
I could see you before I go.

641
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,550
I feel good.

642
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,950
It's all thanks to having met a good friend.

643
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,790
I'm sorry for going first and leaving you behind.

644
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:53,280
Please stay healthy, Orabeoni.

645
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,680
Some day...

646
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,570
let's meet again.

647
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,940
Be happy, my ugly.

648
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,850
My sister,

649
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,790
my friend,

650
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:10,580
and my bride, too,

651
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,350
have left.

652
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,300
And as always...

653
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,980
I am left all alone.

654
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,850
Cheer up.

655
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,180
Do you know why there are two sandwiches?

656
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,600
It's for sharing. Don't refuse and just accept it.

657
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,200
In this vast world

658
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,910
there's got to be a place to work for us. Here.

659
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,110
How frustrating could it be for a young man like you.

660
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,950
But then, let's have strength.

661
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,760
Won't there be a late life

662
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,930
which shines brightly?

663
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:32,090
In anyone's life

664
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,340
there is a time when God stops by.

665
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:40,010
When you are drifting apart from the world

666
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,030
if someone pushed your back towards the world.

667
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:49,550
That is... the moment that God has stopped by in your life.

668
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,800
Then I will be going first.

669
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,690
Look here, Mr. Kim.

670
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,140
Not there, but go this way.

671
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:02,710
There will be someone who needs your help.

672
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:06,200
It's the payment for the sandwich.

673
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,060
Chairman, if you look at it, would you know?

674
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:23,300
Yes. First, I know that it is broken.

675
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,660
Do you want me to look at it?

676
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,480
Would you know if you look at it?

677
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,670
I've been working on cars for about 20 years.

678
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,440
It would be faster if you contact your insurance company. Why are you here like this?

679
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,920
Have you called the insurance company?

680
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,660
Since you jumped right in I wasn't able to think about it. I will call right away.

681
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:53,140
I guess... I was meant to meet a new fate.

682
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:58,810
Fate? You are such a romanticist, elder.

683
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:03,290
Yes, I am a bit on that side.

684
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,030
Kim Seon. Wang Yeo.

685
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:17,140
That night, as I sent a lantern...  I prayed  in a far away life my sister and

686
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,800
in a far away life, my king...

687
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,830
would meet again in the after life.

688
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:30,860
And I prayed in that life where they meet again

689
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,810
they would be happy.

690
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,170
What is this?

691
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:44,400
When you suppress the criminal, do it at once. When you put on the handcuff,  do it ruthlessly. When you read them their Miranda Rights, say them clearly.

692
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,910
You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions...

693
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,380
I asked what are you doing? Is it so hard to understand?

694
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,530
You asked to show a demonstration on how to arrest a criminal.

695
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:57,760
No... that... I asked you to show me, not do it to me.

696
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,670
The criminal is over there! There!

697
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,300
The criminal is her? Well, you look like a criminal.

698
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,330
I'm sorry.

699
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,660
Can't you see right away that I am the detective?

700
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,800
The moment I saw, even when I looked again... you look like a criminal the more I look at you.

701
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,500
This person, seriously. Where do you see me as a criminal?

702
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,120
Did I steal your heart or something?

703
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,320
You look like a lady at the gambling place. From head to toe.

704
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,150
Because I'm the gambling lady, I'm undercover right now.

705
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,420
Undercover!

706
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:37,390
This is a historical play with the background of 2016 so...

707
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,000
Never mind. Director, what is this person?

708
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,400
Why is he doing this to me?

709
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,010
I didn't introduce you two.

710
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,850
He is a homicide detective that will give us advice.

711
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:52,140
I am Lee Hyeok from Gangnam Station.

712
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,270
Hyeok? Amazing.

713
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,170
I can hear you.

714
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,400
Don't misunderstand. I am an actress.

715
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:17,090
We came to film but the staff didn't reserve a room so I had no choice but to come here.

716
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,500
No choice.

717
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,980
I am her stylist.

718
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,650
There's only one room left.

719
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,140
How can they always have only one room left all the time?

720
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,970
We can't help it.

721
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:39,980
Please give us that room.

722
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,060
Please hurry and give it to us.

723
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,290
Even if we go out, only our legs would get tired.

724
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:49,060
When legs get tired, they get thick.

725
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,180
We need to sleep early so that my skin tomorrow would be stable.

726
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:55,660
No, how could they not get a room for an actress?

727
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:00,200
I didn't ask. Here, the key.

728
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,500
Lead the way... stylist.

729
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,700
Do you have a room?

730
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,320
Aigoo. What to do? We have only one room.

731
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,030
Pretend you didn't hear.

732
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,030
I didn't hear it.

733
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:23,760
So... what are we?

734
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:26,490
What?

735
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:34,320
No... well... let's date, let's meet, I like you... when are you going to do that?

736
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,100
Aren't you going to do that?

737
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,100
Do I have to do that first?

738
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,970
Then should I do it first? I'm an actress.

739
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,500
It's already infuriating that I liked you first.

740
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,160
Who said that? That you liked me first?

741
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,530
Everyone says... that I was the first one to like you. Isn't that the case?
- No.

742
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:51,990
- What is?
- I was the first to like you.

743
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:57,160
This is my repor-no, my sincerity.

744
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:05,300
If you were even a bit late, I would have been the first one to like you.

745
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:08,390
Give me your hand.

746
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:14,550
♬ You keep on asking ♬

747
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:18,800
♬ You always want to verify ♬

748
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,940
♬ Even if I tell you the same thing. Even if I tell you every day ♬

749
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:24,780
What is this?

750
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,300
Just think of it as something like a handcuff.

751
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,820
Since you just stole my heart.

752
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,740
You see the lion(saja) here. I heard your nickname was violent grim reaper(saja)?

753
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,800
Isn't this a bribe?

754
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,130
♬ What you want to hear ♬

755
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:42,540
Then you should go and arrest me then.

756
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:47,050
♬ The word that tests me ♬

757
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:52,950
♬ You're so beautiful. You're beautiful. I said you're beautiful ♬

758
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:57,840
Then... starting today, it's our Day One.

759
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,180
♬ No matter how often I tell you and tell you again ♬

760
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:06,820
♬ You seem angry ♬

761
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,820
Are you going out, My Lord?

762
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,400
I want to go for a walk.

763
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,830
You should avoid the big road.

764
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:23,130
There are students from Korea who came for a vacation so it's a bit noisy.

765
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:26,800
- I will be back.
- Yes, My Lord.

766
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,540
I found you.

767
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:13,930
Where would you find sadness that goes on for thousands of years? Where would you find a love that goes on for a thousand years?

768
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,060
I give one vote that there is one.

769
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,160
Which side are you going to put it on? On sadness or love?

770
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,410
Sad love.

771
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:58,810
Mister, you know who I am, right?

772
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:08,240
My first and last... Goblin's bride.
