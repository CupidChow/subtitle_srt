1
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,500
Goblin

2
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,710
Wait a moment.

3
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,560
But I'm not done talking.

4
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,030
Did you just come through that door, following me?

5
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,950
But what's with this place?

6
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,330
What's going on here? Where is this really?

7
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,040
Canada.

8
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,850
Canada? That maple nation? The aurora place?

9
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,990
Is this really abroad?

10
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,630
Amazing! You had this kind of power?

11
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,010
You do, too. What are you really?

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,180
If this is really Canada and if you can do this with your power, then I've decided.

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
- On what? 
 - I've made up my mind.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,740
- About what? 
 - I'll marry you, Mister.

15
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,040
No matter how I think about this, I really think you are a goblin.

16
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,060
I love you.

17
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,980
Look how you're acting like it's the first time you heard it.

18
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,940
- Don't! 
 - Oh!

19
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,250
Look how you're not saying no outright. Okay, let's go that way.

20
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,800
Think of it as our honeymoon.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,350
Hey!

22
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,190
♬  Only your voice is heard loudly above everything    ♬

23
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,660
♬   Nothing else is heard and<   ♬

24
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,090
♬   I can only see your big eyes   ♬

25
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,460
♬   Maybe I really am crazy   ♬

26
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,050
♬  Since I only think of you all day,   ♬

27
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,390
♬  It seems there’s something wrong with my head  ♬

28
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,740
♬  Is it perhaps that I have   ♬

29
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,800
♬ fallen for you?  ♬

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,580
I look really natural, right? I don't look like an illegal alien, right?

31
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,480
I don't look like someone who's come abroad for the first time, right?

32
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,190
♬ That you keep on saying one thing and then the opposite    ♬

33
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,750
♬  You shake me up  ♬

34
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,540
♬  Your coming and going here and there ♬

35
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,180
♬   makes me all confused  ♬

36
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,360
♬  I keep seeing you again and again even in my dreams ♬

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Merry Christmas.

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,370
♬   You're  everywhere  ♬

39
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,890
Merry Christmas.

40
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,510
♬  Only your feelings  ♬

41
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,700
♬   appear to my eyes ♬

42
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,210
♬   That's all I can see.   ♬

43
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,700
Could you take a picture for me? I want to have a trace of me in this scenery.

44
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,450
- If you look here, and you push this, and you hear a click...
 - I know.

45
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh, unexpected. Then, take it after you go one, two, three.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,350
I don't want to.

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,890
Seriously! Where are you going?

48
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,400
Hey, wait for me.

49
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,110
Maple nation, for sure.

50
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,490
Is this the place? The red carpet for me?

51
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,140
You feel honored to be walking with me, right?

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,430
Good. I was nervous you might say, "honored, my foot."

53
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,840
By the way, what's that sign?

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,460
Fairy sighting zone.

55
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:56,650
This is? Fairies come out? Awesome. It's romantic.

56
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,970
How great for you.

57
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,010
Why is it great for me?

58
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,540
Fairy sighting. You met a fairy. Tinkerbell.

59
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm a little upset that I got caught. How did they know I'd come?

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,520
They put that stuff there so people can make romantic memories like this.

61
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,820
What's the name of this neighborhood?

62
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,200
Quebec.

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,390
Even the name's dashing. But did you know this?

64
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,360
If you catch a falling maple leaf...

65
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,450
You caught it? Hurry and throw it away.

66
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,720
Why should I?

67
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,090
If you catch a falling maple leaf, you'll fall in love with the person you are walking with.

68
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,970
Be honest. You just made that up, right?

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,600
I didn't. It's in the same category of a catching a falling cherry blossom and your first love comes true.

70
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,950
You said you loved me.

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,300
- Are you a goblin? 
 - No.

72
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
That's why you should hurry and throw it away.

73
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,080
Why did you want to catch it then?

74
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,580
I thought I was walking with that other guy.

75
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,680
Other guy?

76
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm going to go close to the handsome guy and take a closer look.

77
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,750
Ghost. Canadian ghost!

78
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,560
Scary.

79
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,530
I made eye contact with the ghost. I'm nauseated.

80
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,020
You said you see ghosts often. What's so scary?

81
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,290
He tried to talk to me in English. When a ghost talks to me in English, it's scarier.

82
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,460
But this, Mister! Isn't this a hotel?

83
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,310
I know we are abroad, but don't you think this is too much with a high schooler? You were saying this and that way.

84
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,840
You said you were going to marry me.

85
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,890
Are you a goblin, Mister?

86
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,820
I'm not. Rest here.

87
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,730
- Where are you going? 
 - I've got something to do.

88
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,250
What thing do you have to do? Can't I come with you?

89
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,160
It's my first time abroad so I'm very scared.

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,510
A kid who's so scared runs around everywhere really well.

91
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,340
That's because... you were by me and I trust you.

92
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,690
Will it take long? Who are you meeting?

93
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,890
Oh, you're meeting a woman then.

94
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,370
Right? To come all the way to Canada must be because of some appointment.

95
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,850
You must have had your reason to say I wasn't the goblin bride.

96
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,770
I got it. See you later.

97
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,150
I have no money and no passport and nobody I know.

98
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,180
My breathing's unstable, too, but I'll just have to wait alone.

99
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,090
You know what I'm saying, right?

100
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,940
I don't.

101
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,990
It means, could you lend me $10?

102
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,010
You could abandon me. Well, intentionally or accidentally. In that case, I'll need to call the embassy.

103
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,930
If I abandon you, summon me. That'll be faster than the embassy.

104
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,900
It's not even $100 but just $10 but he reasons it like that. Yeah, don't give me any.

105
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,860
Okay!  Yeah? You're not.  You can't give it to me.

106
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,000
Give me a break!

107
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,880
Your change and receipt.

108
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,670
I'll enjoy it.

109
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:36,130
This is the  miscellaneously omitted person document you asked for.

110
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,580
They said it must be hand-written.

111
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,280
Okay.

112
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,050
But how does a miscellaneously omitted person happen?

113
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,000
I only heard of the existence of a miscellaneously omitted person,

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,210
- I never handled one in real life. 
 - It's like a god's whim.

115
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,740
Humans call that a miracle. And we call that

116
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,720
a miscellaneously omitted person.

117
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,650
Then, is your case a miracle, too?

118
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,000
It's even more peculiar. Her name isn't on the list of the living or the dead, so I don't know how to apply this.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,300
It sounds like a headache. When will you ever get the papers done?

120
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,510
I know.

121
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:17,390
Anyway, Sunbae, I heard you moved. You're not doing a house warming party?

122
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,990
It's a lease.

123
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,640
I need to move, too. I can't seem to save money.

124
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,420
I don't know if the owner has supernatural sense but she keeps saying the grim reaper appears in her dream. It's killing me.

125
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,880
That's why I keep telling you you need to pick a good location.

126
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,010
It's just that I really want to experience living in a rooftop house.

127
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:39,990
But isn't it really weird? We're grim reapers, but we need a place to live. We get sleepy if we don't sleep, and we get hungry if we don't eat.

128
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,650
I'm so tired now from working late these past few days.

129
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,750
These days, I live on this.

130
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,370
Oh, right. There's a really pretty girl in the new '23 class.

131
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,760
Where are you trying to run away to after hitting someone?

132
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,590
What?

133
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,520
Right? You drank alcohol, didn't you?

134
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,270
Work hard.

135
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,140
That's it.

136
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,260
Are you nuts? Who drank?

137
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,290
Hey, your limbs are fine so stop throwing crap.

138
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,580
Let's go to the police. To the police!

139
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,340
Let go. Let go!

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,430
Let go, I said.

141
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,560
- Try to kill me! 
 - Let go.

142
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,090
Na Kyeong Won, Kim Ye Ryong. Dead 2016, tenth month, 4th day (lunar calendar)

143
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:36,060
02:22, car accident deaths. That's you guys, right?

144
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,830
Drink it. It will erase your memory of this life.

145
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,630
Must I really forget everything?

146
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,160
My resentment towards him, too?

147
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,460
Listen, woman. It's your fate. You're dead already. Why bother depending on that now?

148
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,030
It's better that you do.

149
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,040
Oblivion is also a consideration from god.

150
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,170
But why do you only give this to her and not me?

151
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,900
You need to remember what crimes you committed. It's not even the first time you hit and killed someone.

152
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,870
First, you will regret this moment you couldn't drink the tea.

153
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,400
Next, you will think about why you couldn't drink the tea and you will come to a realization.

154
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,480
That you can't undo this moment.

155
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,840
And that you are already

156
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,870
in hell.

157
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,570
Your body will be ripped in pieces every day.

158
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,290
Every second you feel agony you will regret what you did.

159
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,690
But that agony will never cease.

160
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,590
Forever.

161
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,860
I did wrong.

162
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,050
Forgive me.

163
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,810
Well, he's quite impulsive.

164
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,760
I know someone who is living in hell with all the memories of his life intact.

165
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sure he's begged countless times for forgiveness, too.

166
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,500
But there was no use,

167
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,340
he was still standing in the middle of hell.

168
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,300
The young grandson of the grandson of the grandson who left Goryeo with me

169
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,870
is buried here. 
 (Yu Geum Seon, born in Korea he sleeps in a strange land.)

170
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,620
I've once thought of this living as a prize. 

171
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,730
But in the end, my living was a punishment. 

172
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,410
I could never forget any of the deaths. 

173
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,060
Have you been well?

174
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,120
[Yoo Geum Seon]

175
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:30,550
And you guys, as well? I'm still alive like this

176
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,940
and was not able to be in peace.

177
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,010
Quebec

178
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,840
 [Letters] 

179
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,370
Found you.

180
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:29,230
♬ Through the endless daydream, I saw you on the way back   ♬

181
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:36,330
♬  There I walk with you in my arms ♬

182
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:43,870
♬ Through the blurry darkness, Who's veiling on the twilight ♬

183
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:51,450
♬ We've been far away from my fears ♬

184
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,290
I told you to stay quietly.

185
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,600
I was. You didn't even realize I came.

186
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,650
You had business here?

187
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,640
I'm done now. I was just about to leave.

188
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,630
But why is it that your grave is the only one that doesn't have a name?

189
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,890
You always leave where you live like this? How many times?

190
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,330
I haven't counted.

191
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,270
Hello, I'm Ji Eun Tak.

192
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,640
In about 200 years, I will be your bride.

193
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,120
That's not true.

194
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,670
Maybe not.

195
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,850
But even after 200 years, you will still be dashing.

196
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,740
You're mean at times but you're growing up well so don't worry too much.

197
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,020
Well then.

198
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,730
Let's go.

199
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,980
Did you live here for a long time?

200
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:25,210
From the time that place went from a cabin in a desolate backwoods to a hotel, I went and came back and again.

201
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,600
This was the first place I settled in after leaving my hometown.

202
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,060
What a shame. You should've bought the cabin then.

203
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,040
Then that hotel would be yours.

204
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,020
Is that hotel possibly yours... ?

205
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,220
What's with that look?

206
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,520
Do you want to eat this?

207
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,290
Where did you get this from? You don't have any money.

208
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,610
So I stole it.

209
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,030
Hurry, eat up. We have to eat and get rid of it.

210
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,290
What?

211
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,870
You believed that?

212
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,140
I stared at it because I was in awe and they pitied me and gave it to me.

213
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,110
But is that hotel really yours?

214
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,450
- Aren't you running late? 
 - For what?

215
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,860
For school.

216
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,980
What's the time now in Korea?

217
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,420
10 am.

218
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,560
My teacher's going to kill me.

219
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,310
Should I just live here?

220
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,300
I mean, being an illegal immigrant is better than being tardy, right?

221
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,570
I think that would be  better.

222
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,820
I slept well.

223
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,830
I feel like I woke up from a dream.

224
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,830
I never imagined traveling abroad,

225
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,170
but thanks  to you I could even go abroad. Thank you for today.

226
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,520
Well then...

227
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,800
Since I've woken from my dream, I should get going to school.

228
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,720
Even if I was a pest to you today, forgive me for once.

229
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,970
It was probably because I was so excited.

230
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,840
What time is it now?  The time, now!

231
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,760
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,760
You're a senior. How can a senior come to school at the 3rd hour?

233
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,240
Did you come for school lunch? Or is it that you don't want to attend school?

234
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,330
You've turned in your application and you're done with your senior year? Like you already got into a college.

235
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,320
You said you didn't have tuition money.

236
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,150
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:03,060
I asked why you were late. I know you're living a hard life under supervision by your aunt, but you're not the only one who's having a hard time.

238
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,130
Everyone lives struggling.

239
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,700
Just because the SAT is almost over and you can't go to college, you can't bother other kids.

240
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,720
I'm going to university.

241
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,560
What's with the look.

242
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,150
Go! Did someone stop you from going?

243
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:23,260
You are always this way even when I'm being nice.

244
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,440
Wait a minute.

245
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,430
How have you been, Ji Soo's mother. Oh, yes, yes.

246
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,250
You're too kind.

247
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:54,390
Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @viki.com

248
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,540
The evening you come home after getting rained on, what is the thing that is like an umbrella to you? 

249
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,480
A voice that answers when you call. 

250
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,440
A memory of seeing the same thing at the same time. 

251
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,820
Those moments when you first matched your walking pace. 

252
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,780
Is someone coming to mind? 

253
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,230
Yes, that's the person. 

254
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,450
Here's the first song for you. 

255
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,830
I'm talking to you. 

256
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,640
- Are you busy? 
 - Yeah, I'm busy.

257
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,090
Then follow me outside.

258
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,260
Follow closely, but not too close.

259
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,950
- It needs to be something so important that I should follow you closely or else you're dead.
- I'm verifying that, too.

260
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,300
My survival.

261
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,560
What are you talking about?

262
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,200
How come you came out from there?

263
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,290
It's surprising, right?

264
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,560
That girl was able to do something that even the reaper finds surprising.

265
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,190
What, who? Who did what?

266
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,410
Do it again. I'm going to stick even closer.

267
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,650
- What are you doing? 
 - What, why? I'm being competitive. Where am I going to?

268
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,590
I'm just a monster. Get lost.  Far far away.

269
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,450
Get lost!

270
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,270
What am I if you just leave like that?

271
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,390
What is it? What can I not do?

272
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,110
- Mr. Tenant? 
 - Oh, you scared me.

273
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,050
Why is our Mr. Tenant out? It's cold outside.

274
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,230
What about Uncle?

275
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:41,980
Inside.

276
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,710
No, no. Actually I came to see you.

277
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,520
- Stay there. 
 - Oh, yes.

278
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,190
You must really hate physical contact.

279
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,770
Well, it's nothing serious, but I was just wondering if there was any problem that you're finding uncomfortable in living here?

280
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:02,450
Like it gets damp suddenly or really bright outside the room?

281
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,800
I just wish your uncle would suddenly leave home.

282
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,290
I know, right? To be honest, I really wish my uncle left to go abroad as soon as possible.

283
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,620
If you get to know him, he's actually quite a big person, but I don't know why he's staying in Korea like that.

284
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
You feel that too, right?

285
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,980
- No. 
 - Oh, you don't.

286
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,390
But I think I'm going to come here quite frequently in the future, so what should we call each other?

287
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,650
It might sound really distant to keep calling you a tenant.

288
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,390
Uncle... is probably too close.

289
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,090
I'll get straight to the point.

290
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,400
Uncle down the hall, save me once.

291
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,580
If some grandfather comes and asks who you are, can you just say you're visiting?

292
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,630
He would really kill me if he knew I gave out the room for rent to you.

293
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,080
Who's that grandfather?

294
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,260
My grandfather.

295
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,650
From the first to the very last, I'll stand by your side.

296
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,700
Really.

297
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,830
I mean it.

298
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,960
If I open this door, it will be Canada.

299
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,100
It will be Canada.

300
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,470
Are you going to use it, student?

301
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,350
No, it's okay.

302
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,100
Senior in high school?

303
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,340
How did you know?

304
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,010
When you're wearing a uniform and have dead fish eyes, then you tend to be seniors.

305
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,890
Oh... fish eyes.

306
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,030
Where do you live?

307
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,920
I live nearby.

308
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,380
That's good. Take this to eat.

309
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,650
- It's spinach. 
 - It's nothing great.

310
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,650
I got it from a guy.

311
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,290
Spinach?

312
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,570
Take it home and make sure you share it with your family, okay?

Where the hell have you been all evening?

315
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,280
It's this time when I finish school and then come home straight away.

316

Stop talking back.

- Mom, I'm hungry. 
 - Me, too, you rascal.

318
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,350
Oh, geez. Other families' kids are good at staying out.

319
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,110
Hurry up and cook! How many people are waiting because of you?

320
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,770
Yes, yes.

321
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,430
Reply only once.

322
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,870
Take it home and make sure you share it with your family, okay?

323
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,430
Mom, Mom, look at this. She's probably planning to go abroad.

324
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,030
I researched this place, and it's Canada.

325
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,260
What? Give me that. Oh, yeah, I knew you would be like this.

326
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,070
You were going to run away abroad with the insurance money? And you say you don't have the bank book? Huh?

327
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,510
Give it back, please. I was just going to keep it as a souvenir.

328
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,470
Why is this a souvenir? When have you been here for this to be a souvenir?

329
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,110
Oh good. I'm glad I got you today. This is how you repay me for raising you?

330
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,070

331
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,860
Give it. It's mine so give it please.

332
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,310
She's all excited about running away, I guess. Looking at how she made kimbap.

333
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,510
- It looks good. 
 - Where is it, b*tch?

What the heck are you?

If she meant that, this is really awkward.

Curiosity will always beat dignity.

I'm very curious so I'll need to go and ask.

Huh?

355
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,220
We've only just seen each other recently. Why do you call me again in the middle of the night?

356
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,100
I was very busy at the moment doing something important. What are you going to do now?

357
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,230
I didn't call you.

358
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,040
- You did. 
 - I didn't! I'm being serious this time.

359
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,880
Did you just think about me now or not?

360
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,080
Ah, that is...

361
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,450
See! I was right? You thought about me, right?

362
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:53,280
Because you keep thinking about me like that, I was brought out here when I'm busy. How tiring.

363
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,840
You get summoned even when I just think about you?

364
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,320
That's not exactly right, but I'm sensitive. So let's be aware of that, the two of us.

365
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,420
Yes.

366

I'm sorry.

367

Why did you think about me ? What was it about?

368

That is...

369
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,050
Canada was pretty.

It would be wonderful to live there.

I was still happy for a moment.

Those kind of thoughts obviously reminded me of you.

Your clothes look expensive and your watch looks even more expensive,

but why do you still look sad?

It led to those kind of thoughts...

Well, that's that.

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,630
But why were you going round and round in circles, during the night? It looks suspicious.

I wish I didn't know, too.

381

I was waiting for my aunt's family to fall asleep.

382
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,260
Once they are passed out they won't even know if someone took them away.

383
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,960
I was going to sleep quickly and come out early in the morning.

384
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,610
They all fall asleep around midnight.

385
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,150
So are you going to carry on being suspicious here until midnight?

00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,100
♪ It smells and it's dirty.

469
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,140
- I warned you. 
 - What in the world did he do to the underwear.

470
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,930
I didn't.

471
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,060
- If there's even a song about it... 
 - I didn't!

472
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,080
What in the world does one do to underwear that there's a song?

473
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,240
Was it very... manly?

474
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,390
I said, "Don't!"

475
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,700
A localized thunderstorm and heavy rain is pouring down on Seongbuk-dong

476
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,040
bringing inconvenience to the residents. 

477
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,260
Everything okay, Uncle?

478
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,070
I mean the heavy rain is only coming down in Seongbuk-dong.

479
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:58,250
But, Uncle...

480
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,730
Why are you so out of sorts?

481
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,100
- Deok Hwa. 
 - Yea, tell me. Did something bad happen?

482
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,390
Before I tell you about what bad thing has happened...

483
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,490
there's something I need to tell you before that.

484
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,830
It's about your family's secret

485
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,800
and my tragic fate.

486
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,790
Don't be startled.

487
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,620
- Actually I am... 
 - A goblin?

488
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,860
Maybe it's not about that?

489
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,140
Since when did you know?

490
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,230
From when I was 8.

491
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,700
Actually, I started to suspect when I was about 6.

492
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,960
You bragged about gold to me whenever you got drunk and you'd say, "Come out, gold," but you don't remember? 

493
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,360
Wow, is this for me? 

494
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,260
No way. 

495
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,610
You're so annoying! 

496
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,590
From there, I was sure you weren't my real uncle. 

497
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,140
Look now, too. You're always like this so how can I not know?

498
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,880
Be careful. I wonder if you're leaking at home and are leaking outside, too.

499
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,480
So you already

500
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,980
- knew I was a goblin, since you were 6 and all this time. 
 - Yeah.

501
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,680
But yet you kept

502
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,730
saying "Yeah" to me all this time since you were 6?

503
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,270
Yeah.

504
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,300
Sir.

505
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,400
Today's localized thunderstorm and heavy rain must have been quite a surprise. 

506
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,860
Seoul weather forecast service is monitoring the heavy rain 

507
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,250
and a heavy rain warning has been issued for Seoul and Gyeonggi. 

508
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:44,070
There's concern about after work traffic congestion from slippery road conditions. Next is Reporter Lee Min Soo. 

509
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,710
Seongbuk-dong is getting an even heavier downpour than earlier. 

510
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,080
People's feet are being halted as they try to leave work. 

511
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,220
The police are trying to reduce traffic congestion 

512
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,020
and advise that people use public transportation if at all possible. 

513
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:01,540
It's raining. It's nice.

514
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,900
What's nice about it? We won't have customers when it rains.

515
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,560
We don't have customers even when it doesn't rain.

516
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,620
They're not coming anyway so it's nice to have the rain at least.

517
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,100
I don't have an umbrella, though.

518
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,190
I have lots. Take one.

519
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,320
I always left it because it's a pest to take it.

520
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,810
Don't be a pest and bring it back again.

521
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,520
Really?

522
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,960
I have an umbrella now.

523
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,990
Is it the first time you've seen an umbrella?

524
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,850
Thank you.

525
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,690
I need an umbrella to appear in my life, too.

526
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,970
It's stale.

527
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,380
Should I give you new ones?

528
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,370
Never mind. I already know what it tastes like. It's a pest.

529
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,480
You're going somewhere?

530
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,380
Part-timer, that's something only the boss says.

531
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,450
You just need to play hookie and play when I'm not here.

532
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,240
No, a worker can't play hookie just because the boss is not here.

533
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,130
I need to work harder when I'm not being seen.

534
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,850
If you work harder when you're not seen,

535
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,680
the boss won't know, Part-Timer. You should play.

536
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,010
She's so cool.

537
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,660
Have a good trip.

538
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,890
Oh, triplets. I'm the youngest one.

539
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,510
Let's have a look. What are you curious about to be here?

540
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,070
Isn't that something you need to guess?

541
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,710
Something's not going well, I guess?

542
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,660
I wouldn't be here if things were going well. I'd be sitting at my shop counting money.

543
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:38,340
Aigoo! You have no luck as far as having children and a husband. You'll have trouble with the opposite sex and will always wander...

544
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,900
So, I have all kinds of bad luck including old age, huh?

545
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,530
I should lose weight, huh?

546
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,790
What a cold fate.

547
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,140
You're a lonely orphan without any relatives.

548
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,450
How did you know that?

549
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,270
Life is like a boat that is floating on an open sea.

550
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,340
I wish I could be on that boat with a handsome man.

551
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,230
I see a man. Be careful of a man who wears a hat.

552
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,140
A very black hat.

553
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,440
I wish that hat-wearing man is handsome.

554
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,590
Where are you going?

555
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,680
Cleaners. It's "dry clean only."

556
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,380
I feel this each time, that that hat's such a great plan.

557
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,740
So that the deceased can have a laugh on their final way out.

558
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,280
Don't seek death. Death will seek you.

559
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,870
It's a proven fact.

560
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,430
- I have to wear this so the deceased can identify me and not be seen by humans.
 - I see.

561
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:46,690
I'm glad humans can't see it or you'd be so embarrassed. Have a good trip.

562
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,940
Are you sure you don't need to iron it?

563
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:32,940
What era did you come from? These days they stick well like this.

564
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,450
How about you? Who laminates maple leaves these days?

565
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,430
The one who's getting this is from the old days so it's okay.

566
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,890
Who? You've got a boyfriend now?

567
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,250
Hey! What boyfriend!

568
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:50,120
He helped me find a job so I'm grateful.

569
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,850
What if he misunderstands you after he gets this, that you like him?

570
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:58,590
He denies my very existence so he won't.

571
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,870
Mister, I have a present for you...

572
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,020
My scarf. I left my scarf.

573
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,550
Indeed... you see me.

574
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,720
Ten years ago and now, too. Same line, too.

575
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,100
What if the boss locked the door. Dummy.

576
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:44,510
It's useless. I know you see me. No one's here to protect you this time.

577
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,840
I know I'm caught.

578
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,870
You moved. Thanks to that I looked for you for 10 years. Now we meet today.

579
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,580
Then don't look for me.

580
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,050
In this life, we'd call you a stalker. Do you know that?

581
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,900
I'm going to sue you. My name's not even on the list of the dead.

582
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,050
It's on the miscellaneously omitted person list.

583
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,990
Though it'll be a headache due to 19 years of evidence documentation.

584
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,880
Then... now what becomes of me?

585
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:24,880
I'm going to die? But I'm only barely 19.

586
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,600
People die at 9 and people die at 10, too.

587
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,950
That's death.

588
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:38,570
But who are you with again this time?

589
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,150
Close your eyes. You can't meet his eyes.

590
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,680
He's the grim reaper.

591
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,450
No. Don't look at his eyes.

592
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,450
It's okay. I know him.

593
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,760
I guess you're working.

594
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,960
I am working, but I don't know what you're doing.

595
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,940
I'm in the middle of meddling with human life and death.

596
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,080
That's what I mean. It seems like a huge mistake.

597
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,820
This kid, 19 years ago, should have already ...

598
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,260
Do I look like I want an explanation?

599
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:47,060
 Didn't you learn to pay attention to the goblin when he's being serious?

600
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,930
 Watch it. I might want to meddle with your life and death. 

601
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,790
Let's run for now. There will be a way if we run.

602
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,120
This way.

603
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,820
It's okay. Just stay. He can't take you.

604
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,670
- He just said he's been looking for me for the last ten years... 
 - Still...

605
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,930
Even if he's been looking for you for a hundred years. Even still...

606
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,910
No Grim Reaper can take away a girl who's willing to marry a goblin.

607
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,720
Especially in front of the goblin.

608
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,290
Oh, then by chance, is she...

609
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,990
Yes, that's right. I'm the one.

610
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,060
That goblin bride you've heard so much about.

611
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,010
What will you do now? Are you still going to take me away?

612
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,140
Looks like I'm the bad guy here.

613
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,280
That's the one I'm here for. Let's talk details later.

614
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:47,920
We'll see each other again. It can be a coincidental meeting like today or an appointed time.

615
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,450
Say it. You look like you've got a lot to say.

616
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,940
See? You're a goblin.

617
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,710
I knew it.

618
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,950
Why did you lie and say you're not a goblin?

619
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:20,230
I didn't think I'd see you again in the beginning.

620
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:24,590
Who knew you'd follow me through the door? No one has ever followed me through my door.

621
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,680
How about after that?

622
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,460
I asked you many times after that.

623
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:31,170
I didn't need to correct myself after that.

624
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:36,880
From the beginning to now... and even in the future, you won't be the goblin bride.

625
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:46,330
Then who am I?

626
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,560
Ghosts always talk to me about the goblin.

627
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,890
They bug me if I don't see them. If I do, they get clingy.

628
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,270
I'm alive like this...

629
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,070
yet the Grim Reaper says I shouldn't be alive.

630
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,620
Who am I then?

631
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,650
I told you it's something you'll have to bear.

632
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,270
I don't think it's something you can quibble with me about.

633
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:15,860
So petty...

634
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,550
This is so unfair...

635
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,230
Do you think I really planned on marrying the goblin when I met one?

636
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,880
Tell me honestly. It's another reason, right?

637
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,590
By chance, did you say you're not the goblin because I'm not pretty?

638
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,330
Because I'm so far from your ideal type?

639
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,020
- It's true! 
 - That's not it.

640
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,180
You always say that's not it. You said you weren't a goblin, but you are.

641
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,840
You're pretty.

642
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:52,680
I've lived longer than 900 years. I'm not looking for a pretty person.

643
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,290
I'm looking for someone who'd discover something in me.

644
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:59,900
That's why you, who hasn't discovered anything in me, you're not  a goblin's bride.

645
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,130
That's all there's to it.

646
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,980
That's what I mean by you don't have an effective value.

647
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,930
It hurts because you make it sound so simple.

648
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,500
You don't need to be hurt. Rather be relieved.

649
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:20,290
If you did indeed discover something in me, you'd be resenting me.

650
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,260
Then why didn't you insist that you're not the goblin to the end? Why are you revealing it now?

651
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,390
For the same reason I said I wasn't.

652
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:36,170
I don't want you to call me out hoping for something. I'm about to leave this place soon.

653
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,850
To where?

654
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,100
Never mind. Don't answer me.

655
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,680
I'm not curious at all. Who said I'd be your bride?

656
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,350
At my pretty age of 19, you think I'm crazy?

657
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:00,760
I won't call you out again. Relax and go on with your life. I don't need you, either.

658
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,800
I just think, "Oh, this is what a goblin looks like."

659
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,890
So, you're finally going to die?

660
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,040
The rumor has it that you'll die when the bride appears.

661
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,840
Unfortunately, I can't die. She can't see the sword.

662
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,990
Well, she may not be able to see it just yet.

663
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,500
Or maybe you have to be completely naked for her to see that. She's still young.

664
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,590
She's still young, so don't go near her.

665
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,640
Why are you protecting her? You said she can't even see the sword.

666
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,510
Just congratulate me. I get to live longer.

667
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,950
Go somewhere else and live a long life. I can't live together with a goblin who meddles...

668
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:17,190
-  with my life and death. 
 - There is an easy way of you moving out.

669
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,900
The exit is that way.

670
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:43,000
♬  It's a beautiful life  ♬

671

672
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,620

677
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,560
Unni, you're all grown up.

678
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,740
Why do you look at books like these?

679
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,040
Should I say it's like doing a background check on my boyfriend?

680
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,050
It's kind of like looking through his Facebook.

681
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,660
You have to do all these things when you grow up, okay?

682
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,790
Does your boyfriend come out in fairy tales? Is he a prince?

683
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,130
I know. If he was going to be in fairy tales,

684
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,510
wouldn't it be nice if he was a knight in shining armor?

685
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,860
What's this, huh?

686
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,920
This is more fun. Read this one.

687
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,000
[Colorful Goblin]

688
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,440
Thanks.

689
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,320
 How about after that? I asked you many times after that. 

690
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,040
 I didn't need to correct myself after that. 

691
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,430
 From the beginning to now... and even in the future, you won't be the goblin bride. 

692
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,890
Gosh... he was just a broomstick.

693
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,060
I'm not going to do this either. I'll throw it away.

694
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,070
Deok Hwa, you...

695
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,330
Uncle, you were here?

696
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:16,720
You said you used to smoke and quit.

697
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,230
That was so long ago. It was 350 years ago, 350 years!

698
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,300
Geez...

699
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,590
Sorry.

700
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,000
What's wrong with him?

701
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,380
He's been like that for three hours. It's so damp in here.

702
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,380
What's with you, Uncle down the hall?

703
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:09,400
Is this a cumulus cloud? I came here wanting to ask you that.

704
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,300
Uncle, no rain, okay? Who'd clean up all that?

705
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,830
Looks like he's thinking about a woman.

706
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:24,050
He spoke more than three words to a woman in 300 years.

707
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:27,290
- He looks like he hurt her. 
 - What? What did I do? What?

708
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:30,040
I guess the fight between the husband and wife didn't end too well.

709
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,500
"We'll see you in four weeks." Is it something like that? 
 (divorce court)

710
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,210
Wow, do you have a girlfriend, Uncle? Is she pretty?

711
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,600
- She's 19 years old. 
 - Geez! Wow! Is she pretty?

712
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:42,410
I'm not thinking about her. I'm thinking about stock shares. What are you saying in front of a kid? Hey, you Grim Reaper!

713
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,490
I hope you don't dismiss the Grim Reaper's ability to foresee.

714
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:48,240
You Goblin, who's thinking about a woman in front of this kid...

715
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:53,620
What?

716
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,550
What?

717
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,060
If you couldn't get her, forget it. But...

718
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:02,770
if you hurt her, you should apologize like a man. Why are you sitting here like this?

719
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:05,440
Deok Hwa, you don't know anything since you're still young.

720
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,690
- Be quiet. 
 - I spoke quietly.

721
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,610
A pathetic conversation.

722
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:14,930
Uncle down the hall, please be understanding. I'm embarrassed of him wherever he may be. I apologize.

723
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,630
Just be a man and apologize. Be a man!

724
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:21,290
Ta-da, ring. Ta-da, purse. Ta-da, credit card.

725
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,090
- Where are you going? 
 - To the supermarket. How about you?

726
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,850
To the dry cleaners. This is dry clean only.

727
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:40,100
- I'll get going first. 
 - Work hard.

728
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:01,220
You said you were going to the supermarket. Is this the supermarket?

729
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,120
You said you were going to the dry cleaners. Is this the dry cleaners?

730
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,400
So, did you follow me? She's not here, either.

731
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,800
She's not there? Did you kill her?

732
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,130
That's a very rude remark, you careless goblin.

733
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:17,350
Going into someone's home wearing shoes is more rude, you mindless Grim Reaper.

734
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,900
- Where is she? 
 - You didn't kill her?

735
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,230
Did you tell her to move?

736
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,130
I came here to tell her to move, but she moved on her own.

737
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,090
You think I can't find her just because she moved?

738
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:31,570
Yeah, you couldn't find her for ten years.

739
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:34,620
The way I see it, you won't find her even if she didn't move.

740
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:40,040
So, where did she move to?

741
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,230
You know, right? Where is she?

742
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,820
It's okay.

743
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,310
I only slept there. It's not like it was my real home.

744
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,740
Excuse me.

745
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,140
Not here.

746
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,720
Not here.

747
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,200
Hey.

748
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,200
You see me, right?

749
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,760
Yes, I see you. I see you really well.

750
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,980
Let's talk.

751
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:00,110
- Where did she go? 
 - Hey.

752
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,830
You're scaring me.

753
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:09,330
- Why are you like this suddenly? 
 - You said I was the goblin bride last time.

754
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,850
Why did you do that?

755
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:15,400
Oh, that. I heard it from the grandma with dialect.

756
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,620
The way I see it,

757
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:24,090
he saved her after seeing her face. Your mom was good-looking.

758
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,090
So...

759
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:32,880
like this, she was dying then her breath suddenly came back.

760
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,380
In the middle of winter, cherry blossoms!

761
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:42,800
Cherry blossoms were falling and it was so amazing.

762
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,900
You're saying the goblin saved my mom and me?

763
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:50,470
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you and your mom were supposed to die that day.

764
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:56,200
Later on the Grim Reaper came. He got nothing.

765
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,780
So in the end, he saved his own bride.

766
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,160
So romantic.

767
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,620
What that mister said was all true.

768
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,780
I had no right to hate him from the start.

769
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,930
If it were not for the goblin, I wouldn't be born.

770
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:19,040
And I wouldn't have memories of living with my mom till I was 9.

771
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,830
Did you get mad... ?

772
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:24,350
At the goblin? Really bad?

773
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,670
What do I do now?

774
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:30,760
How about

775
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,330
you just come with me?

776
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,870
What do you mean, what do I do? You have to marry the goblin.

777
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:47,230
Here.

[BBQ Part-Timer Ji Eun Tak]

780
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:18,330
Excuse me. There is a part-timer here called Eun Tak.

781
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,290
Oh my goodness.

782
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:29,490
Welcome. Take a seat wherever.

783
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:33,520
No. I'm not a customer so tell the owner to get here.

784
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,620
- Quickly. I'm in a hurry. 
 - Then talk in a hurry.

785
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,310
This lady is the owner.

786
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:42,130
Oh... you're the owner?

787
01:07:43,870 --> 01:07:46,800
I'm Eun Tak's aunt.

788
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:53,210
Who did you get permission from to have my precious niece work here?

789
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,990
She didn't look precious.

790
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:58,700
- What? 
 - Do you know "Sa Go Mu Tak?" (no one to depend on)

791
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,230
She's that.

792
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,600
What are you saying? Some Tak?

793
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,430
She's Ji Eun Tak. Did she say she was that?

794
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:08,720
It's okay. I didn't know either so I looked it up on the Internet.

795
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,220
This lady... Why are you talking to me informally (ban mal)?

796
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:15,710
Right? I hate people ordering only half a chicken (ban ma ri).

797
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:16,980
Chicken should be ordered whole.

798
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,710
Why this crazy b*tch...

799
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:23,320
You know, Eun Tak's aunt, your precious niece should be at school at this time.

800
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,600
Why did you come here?

801
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,300
I tried at school several times,

802
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:30,350
but there are too many people there. So cooperate.

803
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:34,820
I'm just worried because she ran away from home.

804
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,580
Hey! Are you going to take responsibility if she goes astray?

805
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,580
I will stay here like I'm nonexistent. So don't worry about me.

806
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,090
Oppa, it's been awhile.

807
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,370
I'm doing okay.

808
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:53,740
Except this lady, who must think I have a good heart because I look good,

809
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,430
is really bothering me.

810
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:59,360
- That b*tch. 
 - Oppa, do you still beat people up?

811
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:03,140
You don't feel guilty beating a woman? Gender equality?

812
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,960
You can't live like that.

813
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,200
What? You're on your way?

814
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,440
The address is—

815
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,850
I'm leaving! I'm leaving! See?

816
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,540
I'm leaving!

817
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,080
What are you talking about? What are you doing? Your dialect is horrible.

818
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,620
I know. I just tried.

819
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,370
You're doing well? Bye.

820
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,560
Geez, what a crazy b*tch.

821
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,780
This girl, wait till I find you.

822
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:48,060
Why come all the way to my house? I was just about to call you.

823
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,160
Look. See?

824
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,250
The borrowers live more peacefully than the lenders.

825
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:59,830
You think I came all the way here because I had leftover gas?

826
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:02,980
I told you I'll pay back as soon as I find the bank book.

827
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:07,350
This girl ran away from home. That puts me in a difficult situation.

828
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:12,790
You don't answer my calls. That puts me in a difficult situation.

829
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:19,830
I even brought my car. Let's go sightseeing in a nice mountain, Ahjumma.

830
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:25,250
I-If something happens to me, you won't get your money.

831
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:29,850
Her l-legal guardian is me!

832
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:36,260
Only her mouth trap is alive.

833
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:39,380
How long have you been talking about that insurance money?

834
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,830
Is there any insurance money at all?

835
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,260
There is.

836
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,140
Her mom had the infant insurance and

837
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:51,620
a life insurance that she paid for 8 years like she knew she was going to die.

838
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:53,780
It's about $150,000!

839
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:59,860
But the bank book keeps on disappearing. I get it reissued and it still disappears. It's driving me crazy!

840
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,610
It's true. That girl has it.

841
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:05,510
I'm certain.

842
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:11,430
What school did you say she goes to?

843
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,620
[Hey. I need $30. I'll pay you back next week. Get back to me]

844
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:38,000
Student, where are you going?

845
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,390
Who are you?

846
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:42,500
Why did you run away from home? It's dangerous.

847
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,570
Why are you doing this to me?

848
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:48,890
- Why are you... 
 - Your aunt is very worried. Get in!

849
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:07,100
I'm curious. To rent this house for 20 years, it must have cost quite a bit. Where did you get that big sum of money?

850
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:12,250
People in charge of the funeral put money on the bier for the dead,

851
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:17,660
so the dead could pay for the ride across the river to the afterlife. I've been saving that for 300 years.

852
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:20,090
So do you think I could give this house up or not?

853
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:23,580
Wow. It's been awhile that I heard the term "saving money."

854
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,150
I have plenty of gold and money.

855
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:29,650
Do you need pepper?

856
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,380
You don't learn, do you?

857
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:52,370
That was a plate from Louis the 14th!

858
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,720
Put down the fork.

859
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,920
Put your knife down first.

860
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,370
I really don't know. I really don't have the bank book.

861
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,940
My aunt has it.

862
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,660
Your aunt says that you have it and you say that your aunt has it.

863
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:51,900
Then one of you is lying.

864
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,060
Right?

865
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,540
This girl!

866
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:09,240
What? You want to really go at it?

867
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:17,680
Student, we're very impatient.

868
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:20,380
Do you know where this car is headed to?

869
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,420
A female student goes to such a remote place and what happens to her...

870
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:29,200
you would've seen it a lot on TV, too.

871
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,630
Bank book. Where did you hide the bank book?

872
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:37,960
I really don't know. Why are you doing this to me when my aunt is the one with the debt?

873
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,390
Let me out! If you don't I'll report you!

874
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:46,820
Report? I'm the one who should report you!

875
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:50,100
Hey, jerk, drive straight!

876
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,880

What promise?

That you won't take her after I leave. 

904
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,300
To bid farewell.  

905
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,130
I'm leaving tomorrow.
