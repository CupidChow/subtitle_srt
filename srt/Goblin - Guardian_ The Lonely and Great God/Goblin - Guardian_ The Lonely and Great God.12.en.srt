3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:50,270
Goblin

4
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,670
A new face. The one I mentioned before who's got a lot of info and has been living in the nether world for a long time.

5
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,220
Ah...

6
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,060
20 years ago,

7
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,200
he even ran away from a grim reaper.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,880
Has it been about 20 years? I made eye contact with some deceased person.

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,930
But that deceased had no information about him.

10
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,160
Really? I also had a similar experience when I was nine years...

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,240
It seems like he had been wandering in this life for so long. He seemed to have no fear.

12
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,570
It was my first time seeing a deceased person that was not afraid of a grim reaper. It was fascinating.

13
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Nice to meet you.

14
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,030
So you are that Goblin's Bride.

15
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,730
Yes. Same to you.

16
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,960
Now, if you gather in someone else's business place

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,770
there won't be any customers. Now we have to do business so you should all leave.

18
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,270
- Cold-hearted girl.
- Starting with you, Unni. Hurry, hurry.

19
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,010
That unfriendly brat!

20
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,260
The feeling is a bit...

21
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,000
In my horrorific life of 20 years, it's my first time seeing that.

22
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,660
Let's forget it. Forget it. I'm so busy so I have no time to think about a ghost.

23
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,890
If I move it all to the middle of the week...

24
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,600
I should push my part-time hours...

25
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,240
A love letter? What nonsense.

26
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,110
I am too busy living, and what? A love letter?

27
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,230
I am...

28
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,740
a grim reaper.

29
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,630
I want to meet him.

30
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,800
I don't want to meet him.

31
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,610
I want to meet him.

32
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,930
♫  I love you, love you, love you ♫

33
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,940
How could I run out of it after 7 glasses?

34
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,340
Even after knowing I would finish it in 7 glasses,

35
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,270
I started with I wanted to meet him.

36
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,870
I want to meet him. I don't want to meet him.

37
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,660
I want to meet him.

38
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,470
You... have you ever been hit by a peach blossom?

39
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,480
I have. I went to see a shaman and I got beat up. The effect lasts a long time, you know.

40
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,170
The earlier one was better.

41
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,630
Right? The one before was better.

42
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,900
But then... have you ever thought of wanting to find your memories?

43
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,240
No.

44
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,230
What are forgotten memories? Isn't it the same as no memories?

45
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,470
It wasn't there from the beginning, so why...

46
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,070
♫ I love you, love you, love you ♫

47
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:19,280
♫ I could feel that we were fated to be ♫

48
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,940
I... miss that.

49
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,380
Don't. We are all sinners.

50
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,110
How do you know what's behind that longing?

51
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,630
I know.

52
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,590
Even though I know...

53
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,270
Every step I take because of this longing,

54
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,360
even though I am afraid where it would reach,

55
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,090
I...

56
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,180
keep longing for that.

57
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,640
♫ Don’t leave my side ♫

58
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,930
You seem to be drinking too much today.

59
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,020
I got caught... That I'm a grim reaper by Sunny.

60
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,040
Nice going. Good job.

61
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,670
In the middle of winter, where could she have found a peach blossom branch?

62
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,000
- I know, right?
- What do I do now?

63
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,750
- She must be so confused.
- About what?

64
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,710
Since it came to this, hold her hand once more. See if I am in there or not.

65
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,900
- I got caught, I said.
- Since you're caught, hold her hand.

66
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,570
See if my face is there or not.

67
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,530
You have no idea. Do you know how hard it is to see a past life?

68
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,790
It's like someone pushing forcibly in. In an instant!

69
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:56,090
The face that I only saw in a painting, to see it vividly in person, was so beautiful that it made me lose my...

70
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,330
It's my sister.

71
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,290
...mind.

72
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,630
I just saw one young and foolish looking face. That young king's.

73
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,360
She must have thought of that dummy, my ugly.

74
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,180
She doesn't care about her Orabeoni.

75
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,780
I am here. Why?

76
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,760
No, next time.

77
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,210
Give it to me! Why are you going through someone else's notebook?

78
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,300
Why is my writing in someone else's notebook then?

79
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,770
What is this? Did you forge a document without me knowing?

80
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,930
Feigning ignorance. It's a love letter. The one that you wrote.

81
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,640
You wrote a love letter?

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,790
He did. To his first love. What kind of grand love story is it?

83
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,190
I was curious about the ending, so I was going to ask for your help.

84
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,420
What do you mean? This is not a love letter.

85
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,050
As if! It was very well written.

86
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,150
"One day after living hundreds of years,

87
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,080
on a day that was just right..." Huh?

88
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,860
- It's not the contents though.
- Yes, they are.

89
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,620
- Oppa Deok Hwa read it all to me.
- After living like that for hundreds of years on a day,

90
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,910
on a day that's just right...

91
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,530
That can't be. There's no way Deok Hwa can read this even if he came from the dead.

92
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,910
Those are words that I kept to myself that is not recorded anywhere.

93
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,830
After living like that for hundreds of years on a day,

94
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,490
 on a day that was just right on a day,

95
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,930
I wish I could confess that it was first love...

96
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,480
That's right. It's not what it says.

97
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,050
That's not right. Deok Hwa Oppa translated it for me.

98
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,700
It's a love letter.

99
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,090
Last time,

100
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,680
when you wrecked a lot of cars, did you perhaps tell Deok Hwa

101
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,730
that I could help with erasing memories?

102
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,580
- No.
- Uncle down the hall, you have to go somewhere with me.

103
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,880
But how did he know to ask for me to help?

104
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,990
Now that I think about it, Oppa  Deok Hwa also found my maple leaf.

105
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,270
Something that I completely lost.

106
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,380
This maple leaf, try to guess where this is from.

107
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,260
What is this?

108
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,490
Wow. That's pretty cool.

109
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,470
Wow. That's pretty cool.

110
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,810
Why did I not know?

111
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,630
He even dared to rent out the Goblin's house.

112
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,510
If it was the king, God or me.

113
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,670
This character is to hear, "cheong."

114
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,790
I found that girl. She's at a ski resort.

115
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,030
That is because your boss is the younger sister of my uncle in his past life.

116
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,080
Should we grab a drink?

117
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,510
Finally, the Goblin and the Goblin's Bride meet.

118
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,560
It's fate.

119
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,460
Why involve Wang Yeo?

120
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,770
How could you make the person who got stabbed meet the person who stabbed him?

121
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,940
- What brings you to my house?
- You live here?

122
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,060
That is also fate.

123
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,240
- He was also coincidentally looking for a house.
- You should bring it down a notch.

124
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,130
What on earth are you thinking?

125
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,680
I love him particularly.

126
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,360
Kim Shin has been punished for 900 years already. Is that still not enough?

127
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,700
Such is the weight of a person's life.

128
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,800
You should have just created a perfect world without sins from the first place, then.

129
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,930
Then they won't seek God.

130
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,340
They are children I've blessed with love. Stop bothering them.

131
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,300
Stop covering that child's eyes, too. Leave them alone to recognize each other,

132
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,810
whatever decision they make.

133
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,880
That's too bad. I liked his good looks.

134
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,980
They're finally here.

135
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,390
Deok Hwa, you...

136
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,310
Who are you? Let's introduce ourselves.

137
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,560
God of stars! God of heavens!

138
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,940
Do not pray to anyone. SinceGod is not listening.

139
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,360
"God is still not listening."

140
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,350
You were complaining.

141
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,250
"God must have a reason to erase my memories."

142
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,130
f you remember, you do. If you don't, you don't. if we don't, then we don't. It should all be God's intention.

143
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,330
You were guessing my intentions.

144
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,230
I was always listening. Since you were pleading for death, I gave you a chance.

145
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,820
But then, why are you still alive?

146
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,380
I have never erased your memory. You chose to have it erased. Even then,

147
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,830
does it seem like God's plan or a mistake?

148
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,140
God just questions. Fate is the question I throw, the answer...

149
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,210
you can find it.

150
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,170
My goodbye to this child,

151
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,120
you can, too... Then,

152
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,910
I'll get going.

153
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,570
Uncles, why are you here? When did you come?

154
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,660
Why am I on the ground?

155
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,980
Awesome! Did I just black out?

156
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,830
With just one drink?

157
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,630
Whoever you are, let me hit you once.

158
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,820
Why are you doing that to the child? He's innocent.

159
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,830
That person?

160
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,980
- I am sorry for always saying, "Let's go somewhere." 
 - What?

161
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,900
What's wrong with him, Uncle?

162
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
How can you say... Are you really Deok Hwa?

163
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Hey! The butterfly! Butterfly man!

164
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,840
- Uncle, you're drunk!
- Come here! Aren't you coming?

165
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,810
Time. I'll talk. Let go of me. Let go.

166
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,270
So hot. Hot.

167
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,880
But it's really delicious.

168
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,490
The man turns out to be a grim reaper.

169
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,960
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

170
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,200
I witnessed a very strange moment.

171
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,320
I somehow had a connection with him since I was young.

172
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,090
I'm sorry for not telling you. But then, Mr. Kim Woo Bin as a grim reaper

173
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,310
is really kind and gentle.

174
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,650
Are there any obsessive girl ghosts that follow him?

175
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,070
That was the first thought I had.

176
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,950
He doesn't match with my conditions. I'm out of his league. It's this life and the afterlife.

177
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,650
How could you think of those?

178
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,240
I thought of this, if that person is a grim reaper,

179
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,640
then the person who claims to be my Orabeoni must have really lived close to a thousand years.

180
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,580
Is that right? So are you the wife?

181
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,480
- Goblin's wife?
- Technically speaking,

182
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm the "husband," since I'm the breadwinner.

183
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,660
This is crazy.

184
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,520
But you know, Boss, even if you hang around our house

185
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,140
the probability of meeting Mr. Kim Woo Bin is slim.

186
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,300
It's an occupation that requires a lot of overtime. Just call him.

187
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,400
How could I call after hearing him say that we broke up? If he calls

188
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,340
then I'd force myself to answer it. Just cooperate.

189
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,430
Yes.

190
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,650
But then, Boss, I'm so sorry.

191
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,970
- Sure, do that.
- I  haven't said anything yet.

192
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,830
Weren't you going to ask to have your hours adjusted 
since you're a college student, now?

193
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,780
Wow, awesome!

194
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,370
Boss, you are a human, right?

195
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,480
Welcome.

196
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,350
That startled me. It's been a long time since I was startled by a human.

197
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,630
Me, too. But why a chicken place all of a sudden?

198
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,980
That person just now, she lives a floor below me.

199
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,100
She knows me. It would be good to help her out.

200
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,300
That's good. Let's hurry and eat so that we can go.

201
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,760
There are so many incidents and accidents in the beginning of the year. I'm dying.

202
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,550
Please enjoy.

203
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,520
We didn't order that.

204
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,480
It's on the house. A new menu is out and you have a tough job.

205
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,800
Aigoo. Thank you for acknowledging.

206
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,150
Woah! The taste is killer!

207
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,140
What's wrong?

208
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,680
Eat. Dip in, too.

209
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,190
What's with you? How dare a soul appear before a grim reaper?

210
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,970
It's been a long time.

211
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,060
You were living as a grim reaper all this while?

212
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,970
What do you mean? Do you know me?

213
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,890
- I sure do know.
- Don't make things up.

214
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,810
Aren't you curious who am I?

215
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,790
How I'm so fearless in front of you?

216
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,070
But more than that,

217
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,650
aren't you curious as to who you are?

218
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,180
Go and hold that woman's hand.

219
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,660
The owner of the store you just came from.

220
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,910
People who have committed a huge sin in the past life become grim reapers, they say.

221
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,870
In her past should be your sin.

222
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,890
And...

223
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,700
inside that sin, I will be there.

224
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,380
I did not erase your memories. You just chose to have them erased. Despite that

225
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,760
it seems like it's God's plan

226
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,190
or a mistake?

227
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,020
What are you thinking so hard about?

228
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,920
A thought that I shouldn't do it.

229
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,250
Why do it when you know you shouldn't be doing it?

230
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,280
I think I might do it tomorrow if I don't do it today.

231
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,260
Don't do that. The atmosphere now is not good.

232
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,980
The department of grim reapers has issued a code of conduct after the incident with Kim Cha Sa from Janghang-dong.

233
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,200
- What is it?
- You all are sinners.

234
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,390
Don't forget that.

235
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,800
I feel so unsettled because of it. This is this month's rosters.

236
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,650
Did he give an answer

237
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,600
or give a question?

238
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,610
I gave you the register.

239
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,090
[Yoo Sin Woo. 81 years old. February 22, 2017 17:10. Myocardial infarction]

240
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,430
I'm home.

241
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:19,650
It's in 3 hours. The cause would be myocardial infarction.

242
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,510
You should go say goodbye.

243
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,560
I already said everything I wanted as he lived.

244
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,990
Even till the end,

245
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,450
I don't want to see him be sorry to me.

246
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,910
For sending off... you can do it in my stead.

247
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,900
Don't worry.

248
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,480
Tell him that he should be born again

249
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,500
and that in the next life

250
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,600
live freely and not be tied to anyone.

251
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,650
And that I was thankful.

252
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,900
That I am very grateful.

253
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,210
What's going on?

254
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,550
Prepare some black clothes. You will get news about Chairman Yoo's death, soon.

255
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,430
Please keep an eye on him.

256
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,910
♬ You don't know my heart. You're too much, too much.

257
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:38,600
This is too much. Aigoo, my back.

258
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,550
Just wait until I become CEO. I'll come here all the time, have company dinner all the time,

259
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,340
and send you off in a deluxe cab, for sure. (He'll have her very drunk.)

260
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,240
I'm going to suggest really tacky clothes and make you always wear that.

261
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,190
Mr. Deok Hwa.

262
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,060
What?

263
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,690
Did Grandfather ask you to keep an eye on me so obviously?

264
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,590
You need to come with me. Now.

265
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,400
There's still a long time till I can get off work.

266
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,470
I prepared clothes, so you may change in the car.

267
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,250
What clothes?

268
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,230
A person who was good-hearted every moment in this lifetime

269

rests here.  Yoo Shin Woo

[A person who was good-hearted every moment in this lifetime rests here. Yoo Shin Woo]

271
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:03,360
I guess this is what it's like, being immortal.

272
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,320
Chairman Yoo will keep turning back,

273
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,630
saying, "He makes me worry."

274
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:28,180
So, the people left behind must live more diligently.

275
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,790
We might cry from time to time, but we should laugh more.

00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,820
No... Oppa Tae Hee is going to America to play in the Major Leagues.

474
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,350
I heard goblins can recognize potential

475
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,400
so I was going to say how cool it was.

476
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,270
This might sound like I'm bragging about myself.

477
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,580
But I've been able to recognize people who would be a big person since a long time ago.

478
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,250
Hwang Hui, that buddy, is the prime example. (Politician in both the Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties)

479
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,880
- That friend Maeng Sa Seong, too. 
 - Alright about that. (Deputy premier under King Sejong)

480
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,710
An adult is talking...

481
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,310
I am busy.

482
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,980
I am late for work. In such a tight cramped space,

483
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,440
where did talk of Hwang Hui come from?

484
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,600
I will be going.

485
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,550
Oh... if something happens call me.

486
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,130
In this small and tiny place, very awkward.

487
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,360
Small and tiny mean the same.

488
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,180
I want to come every day.

489
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,950
Wind burst!

490
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,810
Come here. Come to Noona.

491
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,220
It's late. Go straight home, your Grandma is waiting.

492
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,080
We see each other again.

493
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,070
Last time, I thought I wasn't able to properly introduce myself.

494
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I am... Park Joong Hun.

495
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,390
You look like

496
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,430
you already know me.

497
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,900
- I don't.
- Kim Shin...

498
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,160
Didn't he tell you?

499
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,060
The one who killed me is him.

500
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,820
The punishment that Kim Shin is receiving

501
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,210
increases with the weight of life.

502
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,780
Inside that is also the price for my life.

503
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,090
- What is it that you want?
- There is nothing.

504
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,030
It's just that I want to tell a funny story.

505
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,410
Since you know me, you probably know Wang Yeo as well.

506
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,890
The sword that is in Kim Shin's chest...

507
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,170
It was given to him by Wang Yeo.

508
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,670
The start and end of this tragic story is...

509
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,820
Wang Yeo.

510
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,310
Do you know who Wang Yeo is living with?

511
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,850
How would I know that?

512
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,810
Wang Yeo is now...

513
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,840
living with Kim Shin.

514
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,490
What kind of nonsense...

515
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,960
That's right. The nameless grim reaper...

516
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,730
he is Wang Yeo.

517
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,820
If those two recognize each other...

518
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,040
what do you think will happen?

519
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,470
Now, for Kim Shin to kill me or save me

520
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,200
is in your hands, it seems.

521
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,060
Just like how Kim Shin's death is in your hands.

522
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,180
Now that I look at it,

523
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,900
so you are a child that is in control of death.

524
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,280
You are wrong.

525
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,030
The Grim Reaper that we know

526
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,090
has a name,

527
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,760
Kim Woo Bin.

528
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,310
Did you ask what I want?

529
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,910
I...

530
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,680
want their destruction.

531
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,600
What are you doing not moving aside? Let them take one alone

532
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,690
I don't want to! I sat here first.

533
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,210
Wang Yeo is now...

534
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,500
living with Kim Shin.

535
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,900
I'm going crazy.

536
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,570
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

537
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,320
Thanks for the drink.

538
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,170
I'm sorry for startling you.

539
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,240
Is there something wrong? Did you come on purpose?

540
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,680
I was frustrated.

541
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,490
I have no one else to talk to but you.

542
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,500
What is it? About my boss?

543
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,950
More or less.

544
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,780
In the past life, if someone commits a huge sin

545
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:28,320
they become a grim reaper.

546
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,530
What sin?

547
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,390
I don't know. But somehow,

548
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,880
inside the history of Kim Shin and his sister

549
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,030
it seems like I am there.

550
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,010
Inside that history, there are three people who committed huge sins.

551
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,690
Kim Shin who killed a lot of enemies,

552
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,580
Then alongr with Kim Shin,

553
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,390
the one who commanded to kill the Queen,

554
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,300
Wang Yeo.

555
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:08,930
And the one who controlled Wang Yeo,

556
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,120
the one who led to the death of Kim Shin and Kim Seon,

557
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,780
Park Joong Hun.

558
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,430
Kim Shin is still alive.

559
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,010
Kim Seon is reincarnated as Sunny.

560
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:28,840
Then if that is so, I am ... Wang Yeo

561
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:32,890
or maybe Park Joong Hun.

562
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,000
That's my thought.

563
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,590
The nameless grim reaper...

564
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,600
is Wang Yeo.

565
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,030
But then...

566
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,720
Among those two, whoever it is... I

567
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:54,600
am probably Kim Shin's enemy.

568
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,940
Among those two, whoever it is... I

569
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,670
and Sunny

570
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,010
probably can't date.

571
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,560
Oh! You startled me!

572
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,910
I almost hit you.

573
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,660
I am sorry, you must be startled.

574
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,220
Well... yes, a bit.

575
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,450
What should I do? We're already closed.

576
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:44,020
I see. So see you next time.

577
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,830
Yes. Come next time.

578
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,170
You must never.

579
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,880
bring any tonics to the queen's quarters.

580
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,550
King above the people./i>

581
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,400
God (Shin) above the King.

582
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,280
They say that "god" (shin in Korean) refers to Kim Shin..

583
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,430
Hello?

584
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,930
Let us... meet.

585
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,440
You said we should break up.

586
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,790
I am in front of your house.

587
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,630
Wait right there. I'm going crazy.

588
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,850
How could you come so suddenly like this?

589
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,800
I was barefaced at home.

590
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,090
I came out to get the ring back.

591
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,300
We still have that excuse left.

592
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,530
What's wrong with your expression?

593
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,490
Didn't you come because you missed me?

594
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,960
- You're right.
- But?

595
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,500
But... I don't know who I'll turn out to be...

596
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:53,800
with a frightful heart... I'm stepping back.

597
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,100
What are you doing now?

598
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,180
Everything about me is a wrong answer...

599
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:08,110
I sincerely hope this is the right answer.

600
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:16,050
- Don't do this.
- I, who am not alive, do not have a name.

601
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,720
Thank you for asking

602
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,250
about my well being.

603
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,410
I said, don't do it.

604
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:36,090
A grim reaper's kiss... will make you remember your  past life.

605
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:43,970
In your past life, I am scared as to who I was.

606
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,040
However, I hope you remember only the good memories.

607
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:58,350
Inside... I wish you also have memories of your brother.

608
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:06,170
And also, I hope that person is Kim Shin.

609
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:50,930
Your brother is returning in triumph again.

610
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,920
Between the two of us, whom do you wish would stay alive?

611
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,920
- Your Majesty.
- Answer me.

612
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,620
No, have you already made up your mind?

613
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:10,380
Well... whether I live or your brother lives, you have nothing to lose.

614
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:14,210
You are a fool.

615
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:20,050
Do you wish to die! Why are you dressed like that?

616
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,310
In your heart, you are already mourning.

617
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:29,600
Bring the Queen's jewelry box!

618
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,120
Why don't you wear them?

619
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,070
Do you think I granted you these for you to keep them here?

620
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,490
I don't know anymore, whether those barbarians at the borders are the enemy or your brother is the enemy!

621
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,640
Park Joong Hun is the enemy.

622
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:13,210
Your brother who the enemies could not kill. I will kill him today.

623
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:14,950
Your Majesty!

624
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,540
Your brother's sin is treason!

625
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:26,860
So you should wear this and greet your traitor brother like a queen.

626
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:55,070
Whose side are you on? Even once, was there a time when you were on my side?

627
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,760
Even just once, did you have me in your heart?

628
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,190
Even for just a moment, did you ever love...

629
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,590
me?

630
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,610
Do not stand by his side.

631
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:26,790
That is... the only way you can live.

632
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,890
You'll have to decide.

633
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,510
To  live as my woman or die

634
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,540
as a traitor's sister.

635
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,290
The woman who loves the king

am I also there?

For a little bit... can you please look into my eyes?

644

May all those shining moments of happiness remain

- Temple?
- Yes.

692
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:07,690
Uncle lit a lantern. He does that once a year...

693
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,810
I was told they were people whom he was indebted in his heart that's why he does that.

694
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:17,080
The names were two characters. It was  Kim Seon and...

Did something good happen? You seem to be since earlier.

709
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,120
You took so long to ask.

710
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,300
My sister... My Seon has remembered me.

711

That's great. But how?

I didn't ask about that. That's right,

714

What is it?

720
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:45,350
Ahjusshi is someone bigger than I think. I really believe that.

01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:54,660

How... do you know Park Joong Hun?

725

I'm sorry. But I overheard when you were talking with Mr. Reaper.

726
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,940
At first, I thought it was just a bad soul...

727
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:17,870
but I'm not sure what his goal is.

728
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:21,130
I think that all the strange things happening are related to him.

729
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:25,770
Boss remembering her past life might be because of him, too.

Don't worry. I'll get rid of you right away.

Being a lowly warrior,

739
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,610
even after living for 900 years, you still have no insight.

740

After that I will rip your body apart.

You or me... a life of 900 years,s

747
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,930
you can't kill me with a mere sword.

Don't worry, I'll kill  you somehow for sure.

Because you are so foolish, you lose your life so trivially.

754

If you say Yeo's name once more...

755
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:34,450
Do you know who that grim reaper  beside you is? The one who gave you the sword

756
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:40,580
and the one who stabbed you with the sword is precisely him.

757
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:46,450
He is precisely... Wang Yeo.

758

01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,590
You can't even seek revenge.

762
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:20,910
He said you cried. Why would you cry when even I don't cry?

Is that so? Was I Wang Yeo?

01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,560
this is what you are looking for?

796
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,550
♬   I keep thinking of  you    ♬

797
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:29,500
♬  Do you feel  ♬

798
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,420
Then...

799
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:34,200
♬  the same as me?  ♬

800
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,280
...take them.

801
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:46,230
♬ Whether I want to love you   ♬

802
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:53,520
♬  as much as I wish or a hopeless desire  ♬

803
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,760
♬ I'll keep doing it. ♬

804
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,150
It's an order.
