♬  Where I am? Who I am?   ♬

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,420
♬  This loneliness like a prison  ♬

♬  Although many people passed   ♬

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,680
I saw this sword since we first met.

8
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,670
♬  This place where everyone passed me  ♬

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,590
Then what am I now? Am I still not the Goblin's bride?

10
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,790
Am I not?

11
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,750
I think you are.

12
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
Really?

13
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,170
Then... do I get the effective value now?

14
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,590
Will you not leave now?

15
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,510
For now.

16
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,740
I might prepare to leave somewhere further.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,010
What does that mean?

18
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,830
It means you're the Goblin's bride.

19
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,260
I don't think that's what you meant.

20
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,590
You've been seeing  it from the beginning, so why did you pretend not to see it all this time?

21
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,860
At first, as courtesy, then because I was scared.

22
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,510
Explain In detail.

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,950
I thought it was not courteous to ask something painful to someone I just met.

24
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,190
And after that, if I say that I see it, I was scared that something might happen.

25
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,090
"What if he asks me to get married right away?"

26
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,610
"What about my college? Would I possibly become a goblin?"

27
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,900
Above that, I wondered if you had money.

28
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,000
Pretending not to see it came after those. Because I got mad. It was for a short time.

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,080
What do I need to do now? As a bride.

30
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,630
The first thing you need to do as a bride...

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,520
Wait here for now.

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,930
- Episode 4 -

33
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,600
She sees the sword. She just pointed to it. Like this.

34
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,170
Alright. So leave.

35
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,190
She sees the sword. She's my bride! I'm going to die now!

36
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,060
So what? Isn't that good?

37
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Weren't you looking for your bride to die? The bride that would return you to nothing?

38
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,890
That's right. For most of my life.

39
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,540
Then what is the problem? Why? She wants to kill you?

40
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm not in the mood for jokes!

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,790
What exactly are you feeling? Are you happy because she sees the sword or are you afraid?

42
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,970
I don't know. A part of me thinks that it's a relief that I can end this tiring immortal life.

43
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,350
Then it wasn't always that tiring so I feel like living a little more.

44
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,580
Just say it. I can take her anytime.

45
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,450
She's someone I have to take anyway.

46
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,310
Even though, I would have to stay up for nights to get the documents ready.

47
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,620
- Did it sound like that?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,310
You're right on point. I'm glad we finally have a friendship.

49
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,690
Death is calling me.

50
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,410
If it's ringing the doorbell then it's a friendly death.

51
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,410
Calm down. You didn't say anything mean to her that she would hold a grudge, right?

52
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,730
One way is to die according to your actual life,

53
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,660
since this is a bonus life, like a side effect.

54
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,700
I'll just die. That's simpler.

55
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,110
Right. Let's do that.

56
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,740
You can't even wait for that short while I told you, too? You really have no patience.

57
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,980
Go harder. You only die once.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm sorry but I can't wait any longer.

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,480
After I found out that I am the Goblin's bride, I have been waiting only for you.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,910
For a long time.

61
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,440
My aunt left the house and she also took the house deposit.

62
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,750
Therefore, I have no house to live in.

63
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,690
So, since you said that you will not be leaving--

64
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,410
Did you really decide not to leave?

65
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,120
I will grow in this house.

66
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Adoption is fine, too. I will grow like a cactus.

67
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,760
I will grow well by myself. Please.

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
I approve.

69
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,010
I want to be an ordinary senior high school student in Korea taking the college entrance exam, but

70
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,250
I lost my mother when I was nine and I didn't have anyone to rely on.

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,270
I know this story. I saw that drama.

72
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,750
Without a mother... Under the sky with no mother,

73
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,980
being abused by my aunt and her children for the past 10 years...

74
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,830
I wish it ended with a happy ending.

75
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,540
Then I finally realized, "There is no god."

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,310
While in this hodgepodge world filled with all sorts of misfortune,

77
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,970
I met you. Just like fate.

78
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,310
So, save me. Please.

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,810
Hey, you're asking me to save you but you want to live here after you've seen who lives here?

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,900
If it's not this house, I'll die wandering in the streets or from starvation.

81
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,310
If I die here or there,  I would rather die beautifully in this house.

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,000
They say the darkest place is under a lamp. Starting from today, be my lamp

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,720
so that this ahjussi can't get me.

84
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,650
I'm sorry but between us our friendsh--

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,450
Go inside for now.

86
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,600
Stay in the living room. Don't misbehave.

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,310
Yes.

88
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,110
See me for a moment.

89
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,340
How could a friendship not go on for 5 minutes? How could you tell her that?

90
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,980
Ah! You asking me to take her is supposed to be a secret? I didn't know.

91
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,090
You did it on purpose, didn't you?To a kid who has no place to go and is really pitiable.

92
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,300
Ah, is that why you made her stand outside when it was cold?

93
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,470
Don't ever come out.

94
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,300
What will you do? Do you have a way?

95
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,510
There is a way. Although it's a bit mundane.

96
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,290
Among 1, 2, 3, I pick 2. Here is $5000.

97
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,070
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,430
What does that mean?

99
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,530
This money... keep it.

100
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,580
I, who said that, was the one who didn't know what was what.

101
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,610
Now, I've seen this house.

102
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,990
So what does that mean?

103
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,990
This house is perfect for raising kids.

104
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,570
Let's have kids and live a good lovey-dovey life.

105
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,600
What type are you?

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,620
W-What?

107
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,590
What type of wife do you prefer? A good wife and wise mother? Sexy?

108
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,430
A professional? Should I change it up every day?

109
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,170
You said I was no good, that I was really no good!

110
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,120
I was saying all sorts of things. Cancel.

111
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,950
Ahjussi, you are really handsome. You are really cool.

112
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,460
Ever since I met you I never look at stars.

113
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,360
Why would I look at the stars? I could just look at your eyes.

114
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Ahjussi, do you hear my loud thoughts?

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,950
What are you doing?

116
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,820
I know you heard it all.

117
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm sorry. I keep on thinking to myself loudly.

118
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,910
I lied about that.

119
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,150
A lie? You said you could hear my thoughts.

120
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,400
That lie started there.

121
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,990
Then that time when I was abducted, how did you know?

122
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,090
I just felt it. I don't know exactly but it seems to be because of the mark on your neck.

123
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:15,490
Scammer. In case my thoughts get caught, I really thought of you quietly.

124
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,980
I did it in parts. I did it while singing in between, even while looking at the leaf,

125
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,900
"I'm not thinking of Mister, I'm thinking of autumn foliage."

126
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,470
I made excuses like that. I was even cautious when I thought about myself.

127
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,000
Why? What?

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,520
Why are you confessing about thinking about me, making me all confused.

129
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,090
What makes you confused? I said I really am the bride.

130
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:59,150
So... should I unpack or not? I'm also confused.

131
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,480
It seems like you are not confused though. Put down the money and don't unpack your things.

132
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,030
Is there a number 4, by any chance?

133
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,670
It must be something better, right?

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Grandpa!

135
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,200
- Huh?
- Oh!

136
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,170
Why is she here, Grandpa? Why are you here with her?

137
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,860
He's the grandson that I was talking about.

138
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,280
He'll be living a floor below you so

139
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,960
if you have something you need, you can just ask him.

140
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,110
Me? Me?

141
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,500
Hey, there are a lot of people in your secretary's office.

142
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Do you not want your card usage released?

143
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,970
Among them, I'm most competent so I will assist you.

144
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,180
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

145
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,500
As you can see he's not so trustworthy.

146
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,480
If something unfavorable happens,

147
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,940
please call here.

148
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,480
Thank you.

149
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,830
[Yoo San Woo, CEO]

150
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,930
Are you the Chairman?

151
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,520
The Chairman and his biological grandson, third generation chaebol.

152
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,470
You must be tired. I will be taking him as I go out.

153
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,540
Why? I have something to talk to her about.

154
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,400
Grandpa! Grandpa!

155
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,030
Goodbye.

156
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,370
Suite Room.

157
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,540
Wow!

158
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,300
Ah, so nice.

159
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,190
Feels nice.

160
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,470
So this is a suite room.

161
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,660
It's a nice suite room but I'm by myself.

162
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,280
It's so spacious.

163
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,610
It's scary to be by myself.

164
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:37,750
Grandpa, who is she?

165
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,260
You don't need to know.

166
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,590
Just mind assisting her to be comfortable.

167
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,690
Something really important relies on her.

168
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,590
Something important? What?

169
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,530
Your card.

170
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,530
So unbelievable.

171
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,510
I'm the chaebol.

172
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,040
Why is my card usage in the hands of a high schooler?

173
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Seriously.

174
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,610
Uncle! Uncle! Grandpa has some young girl...

175
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,580
Uncle, what's wrong? What's going on?

176
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,340
This medicine is for my nerves. This is for bipolar disorder. This is for insomnia.

177
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,080
So, I'm asking why are you taking them?

178
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,620
I am really fickle these days, happy, sad, lonely, splendid...

179
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,300
I can't sleep.

180
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,660
Why are you lonely then splendid?

181
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,650
I lost weight.

182
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,640
That man... my uncle... What on earth...

183
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,020
Uncle, what's wrong?

184
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,210
I have the same symptoms. If I shed a tear after seeing a woman for the first time,

185
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,710
what could that be?

186
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,850
Hello, viewers. Today we have a family medicine specialist with us.

187
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,020
We will spend time learning about mental health.

188
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,130
Yes. Physical health is important but compared to that, many people 

189
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,970
overlook their mental health.

190
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,660
Bipolar disorder and insomnia due to nervous exhaustion

191
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,010
are chronic illnesses that stick to modern day people like a shadow.

192
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,670
First, a sign of bipolar disorder

193
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,670
is impulsive shopping.

194
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,390
If a person close to you suddenly buys many items, be suspicious.

195
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,980
Other symptoms include...

196
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,940
excessive self-confidence.

197
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,620
Anyone want to go to the sauna with me?

198
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,010
Forget it if you don't have the confidence.

199
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,610
Wow, he's really excessive.

200
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,080
Uncle, let's tie him up.

201
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,410
Challenge accepted.

202
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,650
One of the representative symptom of nervous exhaustion is hypochondria.

203
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,400
I think the reason I continuously have heartburn is because I have a stomach ulcer.

204
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,940
At least give me that.

205
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,730
You won't die by not having a stomach. You just won't be able to eat.

206
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,500
You said you'll die when your bride pulls out the sword.

207
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Ah, so you're telling me to die?

208
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,410
- That was all we talked about. 
- What's news?

209
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,790
If someone overheard, they'd think that I'm the only weird one. Only I am narrow minded.

210
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,330
Someone like me doesn't deserve to live and should just die.

211
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,280
Why don't you go to her and tell her!

212
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,950
To pull the sword and kill me! That I deserve to die!

213
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,190
- You look like you'll cry. Really.
- I'm barely keeping it in.

214
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,220
Should I just go out?

215
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,530
Is the bus stop this way?

216
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,320
Or that way?

217
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,120
Is Mister depressed?

218
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,290
But it's funny.

219
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,610
You'll hurt my feelings if you're depressed now.

220
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,610
If you don't like it, just say so! What's with the rain during commute time that causes everybody discomfort?

221
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,580
Hello.

222
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,330
I'll escort you to school. Please get in.

223
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,250
Please drop the formal speech.

224
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,030
No, I don't want to

225
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,650
because I'm afraid you might tell my grandfather.

226
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,700
I won't tell him.

227
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,050
Even if you don't tell him, someone will.

228
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,690
What are you doing? Get off, we're here.

229
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,080
I told you not here. Over there by the 4-way intersection.

230
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,970
Absolutely never.

231
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,960
It's natural for a chaebol to drive a sedan in front of the school to gather attention.

232
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,760
If you don't get off, I'll do it again tomorrow.

233
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
- You're really not going to do it tomorrow?
 - Tomorrow wouldn't be fun.

234
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,600
I've already drawn all their attention.

235
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,180
Isn't that Ji Eun Tak?

236
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,200
- Please go.
- You're Ji Eun Tak?

237
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,810
Yes. I was late introducing myself, wasn't I? I'm Ji Eun Tak-

238
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,390
Then you're that shabashaba eyeshaba...You cried a lot, didn't you?

239
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,570
Then, that time,  that goblin book...

240
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,420
Ah, so you know my uncle?

241
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,630
All the pieces of the puzzle have come together.

242
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,650
- Uncle?
- Ah!  What happened to your aunt?

243
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,790
That punishment (beol)? That gold (geum)? I mean that punishment (beol).

244
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,060
A fine (beolgeum)?

245
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,020
Is my aunt paying some kind of fine?

246
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,750
I don't know. I'm just curious about how he carried out her punishment.

247
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,550
Where did you get this?

248
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,080
Why are you asking that kind of question?

249
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,090
Do you want to buy it or not?

250
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,810
It's because this is very high quality, that's why.

251
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,030
I received it as an inheritance. An inheritance.

252
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,770
- What's wrong with your face?
- My mom hit me. Since I'm pitiful, so please give us a good offer.

253
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,950
- You crazy...
- She hasn't been beaten enough. She needs a thorough beating.

254
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,470
Shut up!

255
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,710
One moment. This is a precious item so I have to properly appraise it with some equipment.

256
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,440
[Soo Jewels]
[Gold . Silver . Jewels . Watches]

257
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,400
Why are you hitting me?

258
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,640
- Just get out.
- Keep your mouth shut, girl! You're embarrassing me!

259
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,800
What do you mean by stealing?

260
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,110
Stolen?

261
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,330
I said I brought this from my niece's drawer! How many times do I have to tell you?

262
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,870
- That's stealing, Mom.
- Shut up, punk.

263
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,800
You were the most thrilled. This punk was.

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
Sit.

265
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,620
- So this gold is your niece's?
- Yes.

266
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,600
Why did you lie to the jeweler saying they were an inheritance?

267
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,620
How did I lie?

268
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,460
I never said it was inherited by me but it was inherited by my niece.

269
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,620
Her mom, so, as my sister was dying--

270
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,890
Yes. That's enough.

271
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,670
I got it. What's your niece's name and birthday?

272
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:18,330
She's in high school. She's a senior. Her name is--

273
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,670
What was her name again? What was it?

274
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,270
- Eun Ji?
- Eun Hee?

275
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,210
Ah, these crazy punks. Are you going to come to your senses?

276
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,560
Do you think this is a joke?

277
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,570
Listen carefully. So,

278
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,500
your niece in high school whose name you don't know,

279
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,580
stole these gold bars made by the bank of Korea and which should be kept in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

280
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,570
And you stole these again. Isn't that what you're saying?

281
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,360
No, it's not that we stole them!

282
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,410
Ah, if you can't believe me, go to our home and ask her yourself!

283
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,650
I've been asking you the whole time.The address, give me the address.

284
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,900
The address is Seongbuk-gu, Seoul.

285
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,180
Wait. Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

286
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,220
Seongbuk-gu, Seoul...

287
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,650
What was it?

288
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,820
What was our home's address?

289
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,740
We had a home?

290
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,230
We lived somewhere?

291
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,770
These crazy people. What is this?

292
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,980
Is she really Uncle's bride?

293
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,780
Why is she his bride?

294
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,300
Who knows. Probably god's joke.

295
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,700
Ah. That's why Uncle is depressed.

296
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,050
She's not his style.

297
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:50,260
God's joke went a bit far.

298
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,350
But, Uncle down the hall, my Uncle cherishes that plate very much. The one you just froze.

299
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,750
Uncle said he bought that himself from Louis the 14th.

300
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,690
- That's what he said.
- Deok Hwa.

301
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,820
I won't tell on you.

302
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,600
Is it because of that girl? The girl who brought tears to your eyes the first time you met her?

303
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,720
Think carefully. Are you sure that was your first meeting?

304
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
That's not what a man should do. Take responsibility.

305
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,060
Even if you don't, that girl might remember something.

306
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,510
- But...
- Yes?

307
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,020
- She was too carefree.
- I'm Sunny.

308
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,940
She did this to her hair.

309
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,790
She flipped it like that. And her lips.

310
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,410
She did this.

311
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,270
Like this? What?

312
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,920
I really never met her before.

313
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,670
Why would you not finish your sentence?

314
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,230
Ah, what did she do with her lips?

315
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,710
I won't ask.

316
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,740
Oh my, look at the time.

317
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,800
Why are you suited all up? Is it a marriage or funeral?

318
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,670
Ah, is this why they say marriage is a tomb?

319
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,240
I'm a little reverent right now.

320
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,630
I wish that you would answer honestly to the questions I ask.

321
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,510
You also do international work, don't you? Or is your English too limited?

322
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,460
What? Pardon?

323
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,120
That's good enough. Unfortunately, I need your help.

324
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,080
Why? Are you going to die abroad?

325
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,490
He's too mean.

326
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,470
Why is he avoiding me?

327
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,880
Why aren't you coming?

328
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,430
Why aren't you contacting me?

329
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,020
Open the door! I'm in front of your house! Why are you avoiding me?

330
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,390
Come out! I know you're inside!

331
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,500
You're not coming out?

332
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,780
If you don't come out, I'm going to blow this out!

333
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,580
Do you know what this is? It's a very long and big candle.

334
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,360
I'm going to blow it out. I can't assure you where I'll do it.

335
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,640
I'll summon you at a place where you'll be embarrassed.

336
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,660
Do I still have to wait for you now?

337
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,250
How long do I have to wait for now?

338
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,410
- It's been a while.
- You haven't aged at all.

339
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,290
I told you 4 was the answer to problem #17, but you still wrote down 2.

340
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,260
No matter how much I solved it, it turned out to be 2. Even though I knew the correct answer.

341
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,690
So I couldn't write down 4.

342
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,680
That was a problem I couldn't solve.

343
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,150
No. You solved it very well.

344
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,060
In your life, only your decisions are the correct answer.

345
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,840
Ah. It was that kind of problem.

346
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,000
I see you became a lawyer. You helped a lot of people in need.

347
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,380
I wanted to pay you back for the sandwich you gave me then.

348
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,110
And I didn't have any other choices.

349
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,330
I knew you were there.

350
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,140
Ordinary people don't forget miraculous moments.

351
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,750
I know.

352
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:44,640
I gave thousands of people sandwiches.

353
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,590
But it's rare to see someone who progressed like you.

354
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,340
Ordinary people stay in that miraculous moment and ask for another moment of assistance.

355
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,870
"I know you're there."

356
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,160
As if they left their miracles up to me.

357
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,700
You changed your own life.

358
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,120
For that reason, I have always cheered you on.

359
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,400
I knew you would do that.

360
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,720
Where am I going now?

361
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,250
You can leave through the door you came through.

362
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,230
Afterlife is on the other side.

363
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,480
It's obvious that he's going to a nice place.

364
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,370
I guess. Thanks for today.

365
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,180
Why do you bother doing this?

366
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,930
You don't have to do it. No one's asking you to.

367
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,900
I don't need to.  But if I don't work, I'm not cool.

368
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,990
Sure, of course.

369
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,870
Where were you? You were not at home.

370
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:06,610
Did you come to my house?

371
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,210
Why do you avoid me?

372
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,730
Not avoid... I was busy?

373
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,440
You were busy avoiding me. As far as I know, you don't even have a job.

374
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,470
Otherwise, was I a girl who was

375
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,070
-  abandoned by her husband? 
- What?

376
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,520
Then what?

377
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,740
You avoid me because you're a goblin, then avoid me because you're not.

378
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,160
You avoid me because I don't see the sword, then you avoid me because I see the sword.

379
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,910
Really petty! Petty!

380
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,360
Try to run away, I will blow all this.

381
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,420
Really pretty.

382
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,700
I am really serious now.

383
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,550
Me, too.

384
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,270
You don't have money but where did you buy all these candles?

385
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,400
Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa.

386
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,470
This jerk.

387
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,220
Can't I just live at your house? You have plenty of vacant rooms.

388
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,690
How do you know the rooms are empty or not?

389
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,800
- Yoo Duk Hwa Oppa.
 - This jerk...

390
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,990
You said "wait for now." "For now" usually means about an hour to half a day, at most.

391
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,000
But how many days passed? In the meantime, it rained. Because of me, were you sad?

392
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,930
No.

393
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,260
You can tell me.

394
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,920
I've been preparing myself these past few days. I'm determined to take in whatever you say.

395
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,380
Why are you getting determined?

396
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,810
I'm the one who should be determined.

397
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,720
What, determined?

398
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,610
You do not need to know.

399
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,010
Did you have dinner?

400
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,260
Why? Did you already eat.

401
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,250
Now that you know that I can see  the sword, I can't see you.

402
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,830
I didn't tell you so you'd be like this.

403
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,810
What kind of determination do you have to make? Don't do it alone but let's do it together!

404
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,000
Do you want some steak? Should I order room service?

405
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,230
Looking at you, changing the subject... I am going to let it go.

406
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,180
I don't feel like beef today. Let's eat something else.

407
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:21,330
All the expensive things in the room were enticing me but I didn't give in.

408
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,130
This is it.

409
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,130
Will that be enough?

410
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,620
Choose anything that you want.

411
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,610
I can buy you everything from here to there.

412
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,180
In a single payment.

413
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,750
Stand up straight. How can two cans of beer make you like this?

414
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,910
Should I buy you toothbrushes? From here to here.

415
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,380
Ta-dah!

416
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,960
Extra fine brushes.

417
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,000
Can you please just go. Go.

418
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,160
I don't want to. I will take you home.

419
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,660
Am I really your bride?

420
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,740
Yeah.

421
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,560
Then I can't meet with another man?

422
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,100
I don't want to recommend it.

423
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,210
Then what are you going to do about my third wish?

424
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,260
Part-time job, my aunt's family, boyfriend.  Boyfriend!

425
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,740
In this lifetime, that will never happen. Don't put your hopes up.

426
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,070
Why?

427
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,500
Because I don't like it.

428
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,230
Where is there such a thing? Do you like me?

429
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,330
No.

430
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:55,600
Your "no" isn't necessarily a no.

431
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,650
How did you live until now? Doing what?

432
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,390
I lived waiting for you.

433
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,860
Be quiet.

434
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,980
I said it quietly.

435
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,320
Then, if you're depressed it rains. What happens when you feel good?

436
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,410
Pass.

437
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,240
Don't tell me flowers are going to bloom or something.

438
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,690
No. Next question.

439
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,870
- Can you fly?
- That's a piece of cake.

440
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,060
Show me next time.

441
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,720
I will.

442
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,940
About me... What place bride am I?

443
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,630
You're the first and last.

444
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,140
Let's say it's the first but how do you know it'll be the last?

445
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,890
Because I've decided it to be.

446
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:21,930
What if... I decided not to be your bride, what happens?

447
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,030
Ahh...

448
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,130
Then this sword won't get pulled out.

449
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,730
Only you can do it. You need to take this sword out for me...

450
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,920
for me...

451
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,690
to be pretty. I'm not pretty now.

452
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,550
Ahhh. Is it that?

453
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:04,720
In fairy tales, the cursed prince meets his true love and turns back to himself. That?

454
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,400
In The Frog Prince, from frog to prince. In The Beauty and the Beast,  from beast to prince.

455
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,590
For a goblin, from a goblin to a broo...

456
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,360
Let's pull it out some other time. At the moment, when we need a broom.

457
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,700
You have no idea. I'm the crazy one for laughing at this situation.

458
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,500
Fine. Some other time, then.

459
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,820
Not today. Tonight, just let me laugh with you.

460
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,240
When the first snow comes?

461
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,460
First snow?

462
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,870
You need a broom then.

463
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,890
When the first snow comes.

464
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,050
When will the first snow come this year?

465
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,190
It looks good, really.

466
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,770
Let's take it together.

467
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,680
What's that?

468
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,570
 Cherry Blossoms And Magnolias Bloom Out Of Season!

469
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,510
Something good must have happened last night.

470
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,540
In this autumn, and in a matter of a day, flowers this big are just

471
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,250
crazily... blooming beautifully.

472
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,300
Rain and snow can be explained as a change in weather. What will you do about the flowers? You drank, didn't you?

473
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:07,070
"What are you going to do about the flowers?" "Flowers" "Uncle you drank, right?" All those three things you said informally.

474
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,660
Should we just comfortably be brothers?

475
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,790
- Should we? Hyung, what did you do last ni-
- You insolent...

476
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,230
Just say that you don't remember!

477
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,680
What are you going to do?

478
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,330
It's not because of the alcohol but because of the antidepressant. It's time for me to stop taking...

479
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,920
Why are you suddenly lowering your voice?

480
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,550
You won't even know if I tell you.

481
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,770
What is this?

482
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,030
It's a vacant seat. Let's sit there.

483
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,790
- How could we meet in a place like this?
- Who?

484
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,450
It's the last episode. I can't miss the last episode of the morning drama.

485
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,470
Everyone lives with at least a wound in their hearts.

486
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:03,940
Wound? Do you even know what that is?

487
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,190
Death is the only way I'll leave you.

488
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,400
I asked you to buy snacks last night, right?

489
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,420
No.

490
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,600
Don't think lightly but think properly.

491
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,000
Just wake up from your hangover.

492
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,690
You can't remember? With two cans of beer?

493
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,070
It's not because of alcohol but because of the medicine.

494
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,500
Uncle, what's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

495
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,780
Is there something there?

496
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,100
Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter.

497
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,800
What?

498
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,090
Holy cow!

499
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,790
She's her daughter?

500
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,070
Oh my! I really didn't know!

501
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,080
You're going home, right?

502
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,590
Are you finally surprised that Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter?

503
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,800
What is this? What kind of memory is this?

504
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,650
What is? What is it?

505
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:10,970
What if... I decided not to be your bride. What happens?

506
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,200
This sword can't be pulled out. Only you can pull it out.

507
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,890
Ah, you crazy goblin! Agh!

508
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,780
- What should I do?
- Why? What's the matter?

509
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,900
I told her about taking out the sword!

510
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,770
Uncle, what are you looking at? Are you ill?

511
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,970
Since it turned out like this, I think it's for the better. It's good even if you die now.

512
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,530
Just try talking like that. I'll burn your hat down!

513
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,890
I don't know him. He's a stranger. A total stranger.

514
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,630
Work hard. I'm going first.

515
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,260
Ah, Uncle, what's the matter with you?

516
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,570
Who are you? Do you know me?

517
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,130
Uncle! Wow, during that ruckus, he heard that?

518
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,280
Uncle!

519
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,080
Even if you smear crap all over your face, it'll be pretty!

520
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,020
It's all in the past. "If you cherish it, it becomes poop."

521
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,030
What are you talking about? It's still fine. It's okay.

522
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:30,150
Unni, what's that shadow? It's so pigmented.

523
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,210
Please give me one of those.

524
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,570
Yes. Please come this way.

525
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,630
I got you a purchase.

526
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,240
Thanks.

527
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,510
Do you have an appointment today? Where are you going, looking so pretty?

528
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,320
Perhaps, did you get a boyfriend?

529
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,640
I'm looking pretty and waiting for a call now so I can get one.

530
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,120
But it's not coming. Why is that?

531
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,130
He must be pushing and pulling with you.
 (Playing hard to get)

532
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,730
Did he get pushed? But I pulled.

533
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,890
Roasted Sweet Potatoes

534
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:15,160
But, Owner, why do you always look out the window? Is there something out there?

535
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,650
I'm waiting.

536
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,850
For what?

537
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:25,050
I don't know. I'm always just waiting for someone.

538
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,740
A customer?

539
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,080
No. Sir.

540
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,610
A prince charming on a white horse?

541
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,620
I don't like younger men.

542
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:40,070
Since it came to this, it would be better if it's a king on a white horse.

543
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,690
Yoo San Woo, CEO Woo Shin

544
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:59,790
You're the only one without a name on the tombstone.

545
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,870
[Yoo Jeong Woo]
 [Don't bother this Goryeo person's rest]

546
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:05,450
[Yoo Seo Won]
 [I hope the dirt over you is light]

547
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,670
What is it? Did you pick it up?

548
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,620
Someone gave it to me. Hand it over.

549
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:26,410
Who did? That man who drove you this morning or that old man in front of your house?

550
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,690
You are really so diverse.

551
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,860
Do you know what this name card is before saying things?

552
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,200
It's written on there. Chairman of Yoo Shin.

553
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,760
Exactly. He's deceiving you, dumbass.

554
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,830
Did that man tell you he's close with the Chairman?

555
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:44,480
Let her be. As if she would be scared.

556
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,260
Why?

557
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,890
What?

558
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,600
Aren't you going to look down?

559
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,640
What is this?

560
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,000
What is this cigarette?

561
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,240
Right. It's your first time seeing a cigarette, right?

562
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,640
You must be crazy!

563
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,310
In the school. Even more, in the classroom.

564
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,700
Teacher. No.

565
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,710
Hey, hand me a lighter.

566
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,890
What did I just say?

567
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,820
Lighter? You really won't do.

568
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,400
Come out. Follow me.

569
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,680
Teacher, no. This isn't mine. This is Ji Eun Tak's!

570
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,190
She was going to smoke it, so I took it from her! Search her. I said this was Ji Eun Tak's!

571
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,600
Hey, Park Seo Jin. That is yours.

572
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,240
Ji Eun Tak doesn't even smoke. Just stop.

573
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,460
Hey, class president, are you crazy? Do you want to die?

574
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,190
You are the one who wants to die. You. You know where the faculty office is, right? Go.

575
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:53,740
Go.

576
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,020
Straight.

577
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,910
Revenge on the girl that bullied you. Blood revenge.

578
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,050
I did it.

579
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,560
That bitch was so mean. That feels so refreshing.

580
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,250
Hey! You say you're lonely. Why don't you take her with you?

581
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,780
How could you say mean things? I wouldn't take that girl if I was dead—

582
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,650
You are dead...

583
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,400
If I wake up from the dead,  I wouldn't take her, Grandma.

584
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,530
We did well, right?

585
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,380
Hey.

586
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,470
I put the cigarette...

587
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,620
Thank you, everyone.

588
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,280
I did it.

589
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,350
We'll be going first.

590
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,690
Why? What?

591
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,660
♫ How can I get over you? ♫

592
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,380
I thought you said you don't go around in cars.

593
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,390
I'm just bragging about my car.

594
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,100
- Do you have a license? 
- What do you take me for?

595
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,950
I took you for a drunkard last night.

596
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,070
Yesterday, I didn't make any mistakes, right?

597
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,360
You don't remember?

598
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,430
Can't you see that I regretfully remember everything?

599
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,830
Have you had hangover soup? Aren't you hungry?

600
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,990
Why do you ask me whenever you see me? Can't you eat before seeing me?

601
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,900
It's because I want to eat with you. If you don't want to, then don't.

602
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,060
What do you want to eat together? Beef?

603
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,190
Beef? I haven't even thought of it and I think it's such a good idea.

604
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,160
Stay here for a while.

605
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,650
We're here. Get off.

606
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:36,060
This is my way of saying thanks for the maple leaf.

607
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,310
Awesome. You took me to the maple nation for giving you a maple leaf.

608
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,500
Mister, is this a honeymoon?

609
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,820
Get back in. Let's go back.

610
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,160
No. Let's go this way. I know Quebec well.

611
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,810
As if you know. Beef is this way.

612
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,390
Huh? What did you say?

613
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,600
Thank you for the meal.

614
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,540
There's a lot of swords.

615
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,870
Put that down and talk.

616
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,460
Look at him all scared.

617
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,930
Eat. I thought you were hungry.

618
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:20,120
Yes.

619
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,000
Then... as you eat, listen to what I say without any misunderstandings.

620
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,860
It's because I am really curious.

621
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:35,280
This sword, what does the handle look like?

622
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,900
Are you doubting me?

623
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:46,420
Why are you getting mad? I'm just the cautious type to make certain about these kinds of things.

624
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,730
That's called doubting.

625
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:56,360
The handle... there's a tiger.

626
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:01,500
Right? A white tiger. It's really cool, isn't it?

627
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,520
Of course.

628
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:10,000
But then, I found out more about you.

629
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,660
But no matter how hard I look, I couldn't find anything about that.

630
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,430
What about?

631
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,030
About being stabbed with a sword.

632
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,830
Why did that happen? Did you do it yourself? Others?

633
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,180
By someone whom I never thought would do it to me.

634
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,500
It's a really painful story.

635
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:39,350
Then, nevermind. What about your age? How old exactly are you?

636
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,390
939 years old.

637
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:48,660
I see it's a more painful story. I'm sorry.

638
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,820
But still... it must be nice to live so long.

639
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,920
You don't age, you have a lot of money, and you meet your bride like this.

640
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:05,100
Do you want to live long? Even if you're the only one that's staying the same and everything else flows?

641
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,570
I have you, though.

642
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:12,770
Since you will always be there so I think living long would be okay.

643
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,120
You're awfully cheerful for someone who has such a traumatic story.

644
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,120
It's been almost a thousand years. I can't be sad for a thousand years.

645
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:40,730
I'm just an energetic goblin who humbly accepts his fate and lives cheerfully.

646
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:46,920
Where would you find sadness that goes on for a thousand years?

647
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,080
Where would you find a love that goes on for a thousand years?

648
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,310
I give one vote that there is one.

649
00:53:56,410 --> 00:54:00,020
Which side are you going to put it on? On sadness or love?

650
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,810
A sad love?

651
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,370
If you don't believe me, should we have a bet?

652
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,120
What bet? How far did you research? What else do you know?

653
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,320
You have lived alone for a long time, you are very lonely,

654
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,050
fickle, ill-tempered, like dark and humid places...

655
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,310
You researched mainly on bad things...

656
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,990
You bring good fortune and misfortune to people,

657
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,070
and you don't have a family.

658
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:29,360
Maybe that's why you left me alone in the hotel.

659
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,240
I was taking appropriate measures. You should think about it yourself.

660
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,760
What thoughts?

661
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,130
If you don't want to then you don't have to. You don't need to force it.

662
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,140
- What?
- Being a Goblin's bride.

663
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,690
What is your motive? The more I hear about it, I keep noticing you wanting me to hate it.

664
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:53,050
Why are you saying those now? Ah! You don't want me being the Goblin's bride?

665
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,130
Or you have another woman?

666
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,290
"Even if I have another woman, I don't like you, so don't do it."

667
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,160
Seeing the sword, taking the sword out. That's the order, right?

668
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,930
I will prove being the bride by pulling that sword out.

669
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,430
Let's see if you become pretty.

670
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,990
Hey! Talk while you're there.

671
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:13,290
Then make me gold bars with your magic club.

672
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,360
Why should I?

673
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,780
Hey! I don't have a club!

674
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,000
You don't have one? How could a goblin not have a magic club?

675
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,880
Wow! The water became a sword!

676
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,980
Wow! So cool!

677
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,290
The sword has been misrepresented as a club.

678
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:49,160
I see. So that's why they say love quarrels are like cutting water with a sword.

679
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,710
It's not.

680
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,700
Right. During a honeymoon, it should be a water fight.

681
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,290
Stand right there.

682
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,810
Hey!

683
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:16,750
Good for you, winning against a high schooler. You use your powers to win over a high schooler?

684
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,630
Can't I use it them?

685
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,920
Do I not have abilities?

686
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,180
You can do all sorts of things.

687
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,880
Don't I have any special powers other than being able to see ghosts? After all, I'm the Goblin's bride.

688
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,020
Do you wish you had one?

689
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,210
I want gold to come out this much.

690
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,510
- Can you do it?
- No.

691
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,620
Stay here and wait.

692
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,760
- Why?
- I have something to do.

693
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,010
I don't know when I will be back. You can wait, right?

694
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:00,190
Ah! And also, since you said you're always near books.

695
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:04,710
Have it near you.

696
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:07,770
I will be sad if you leave me behind.

697
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,080
Just so you know.

698
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,910
I won't leave you behind.

699
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,530
Why? Because I'm the Goblin's wife?

700

Winter is Coming --  (No meaningful lyrics)

702
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,880
Please deliver it to him.

703
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,130
Mister!

704
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,000
Mass is not proportional to volume.
(Physics of Love)

705
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,000
A girl as small as a violet.

706
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,250
A girl who moves like a flower petal

707
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:20,400
is pulling me toward her with more force than Earth's mass.

708
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,060
Just then, like Newton's apple,

709
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,830
I rolled toward her without stopping until I fell on her...

710
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:44,760
with a loud thud.

711
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,240
With a thump.

712
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,190
The red carpet is awesome! You were the one who did it, right?

713
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,960
It's so fascinating!

714
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,070
Mister...

715
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,190
My heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.

716
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,980
Mister, are you mad?

717
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,310
It was first love.

718
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,000
♬   Through the endless daydream  ♬

719
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,960
♬  I saw you on the way back.  ♬

720
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:49,220
♬  There I walk with you in my arms    ♬

721
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,860
♬   Through the blurry darkness  ♬

722
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,730
♬   who's veiling on the twilight  ♬

723
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:03,040
♬  We've been far away from my fears   ♬

724
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,810
♬   Somewhere else I see you.  ♬

725
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:12,530
♬  Our days be like a blossom   ♬

726
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:16,430
It was blinding

727
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:22,330
Because the day was good, because the day was not good

728
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,190
The day was just right.

729
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:30,870
Every single day was good. And also,

730
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,940
whatever happens,

731
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,330
it's not your fault.

732
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,590
Ahjussi, perhaps...

733
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,510
are you really going to change into a broom?

734
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,070
There's no such thing happening.

735
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:55,030
That's a relief. Now I will take it out.

736
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:03,280
♬  Hush now. My angel I will always be with you   ♬

737
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,510
♬  In your pretty smile. In the glow of tears, out across the frosty night    ♬

738
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:12,000
♬  In the glow of tears, out across the frosty night    ♬

739
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,100
♬  I'll be there with you   ♬
