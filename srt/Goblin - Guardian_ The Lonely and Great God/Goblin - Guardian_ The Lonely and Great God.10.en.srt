1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Goblin

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,810
Goblin

3
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,340
I asked how did you know?

4
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,110
I asked how you know it.

5
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,550
I said... Ms. Kim Sunny.

6
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,710
Ah, it's very cold, isn't it? I'll get your coat—

7
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,630
I haven't finished talking.

8
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,840
What's the matter?

9
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,170
Why... exactly?

10
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,530
What? Are you alright?

11
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,680
Your pale face just got paler.

12
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,410
Who's the woman that you saw?

13
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,570
That woman I know is my sister.

14
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,090
You'll bore a hole through the window.

15
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,760
Ji Eun Tak.

16
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,290
Even if you look at me gently like that, it's still too late.

17
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,730
What kind of person is your boss?

18
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,030
I've heard this question before from Mr. Grim Reaper.

19
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,580
The question that follows is, "What do I have to do in order for her to like me?"

20
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,980
Can't you see by looking at her? She's pretty. Absolutely beautiful.

21
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,100
I'm... not looking for someone pretty.

22
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,300
I've heard that before as well.

23
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,360
What's really the matter?

24
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,820
Why? What is it?

25
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,890
Well, it shouldn't be your first time holding a woman's hand--

26
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,200
I see right through you! You said you don't have a phone number, then you get one.

27
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,800
You don't even tell me your real name. You're serious because I grabbed your hand.

28
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,660
Are you married by any chance?

29
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,260
No.

30
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,290
Then, there's only one other explanation. Always wearing black,

31
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,620
and your face is way too pale.

32
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,980
- Are you part of the NIS?  (National Intelligence Service)
- No.

33
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Then, are you a Grim Reaper?

34
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,940
You're not laughing. It was a joke.

35
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,960
For now, if you're not married or part of the NIS, then fine. Let's go in, it's cold.

36
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,670
Then, Ms. Sunny, who are you?

37
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,360
You're going to drink?

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,760
Yeah. I really want to get drunk right now. You should have one, too.

39
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,630
Look here, Orabeoni (older brother). Why do you keep looking at me since earlier?

40
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,230
I'm fascinated because you have the same name as someone I know.

41
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,580
Your real name is Kim Sun? How do you write your name in Korean characters?

42
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,630
I don't use Korean characters. I use English. S-U-N-N-Y.

43
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,240
Have you seen me somewhere before?

44
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,840
We saw each other a few days ago. In front of the old store.

45
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,660
Even then, and now. Why do you keep calling me Orabeoni (older brother)?

46
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,490
Then should I have said this, that, hey, you?

47
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,810
What's your relationship with this person? Do you even know what he is that you're meeting him?

48
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,560
A relationship where we exchanged rings.

49
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,060
That ring had that kind of meaning?

50
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,580
Part-time worker, nice question.

51
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,350
This ring... what was the meaning?

52
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:04,200
About the ring... can you give it back to me?

53
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,990
At the cafe we met at before, tomorrow afternoon, at one o'clock.

54
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,210
Now what does this mean?

55
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,210
Truth number one.

56
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,380
The girl in the painting and Sunny's past life

57
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,570
had the same face. Truth number two.

58
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,710
The woman in the painting...

59
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,430
I know that woman is my sister.

60
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,750
Is Kim Shin's sister. Then a question.

61
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,110
Is Sunny a reincarnation of Kim Shin's sister?

62
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,080
I don't know as of yet. Again.

63
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:50,890
Fact number one.The moment I saw the woman in the painting, I cried. 

64
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:58,330
Fact number two.The moment  I first saw Sunny, I cried.

65
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,320
Then a question.

66
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,010
Why did I cry? What is the fact behind my feelings?

67
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,910
Is the history of the two of them connected to my erased memories?

68
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,500
Ah, this is also a maybe.

69
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,820
"How much is a chicken? I could buy the entire chicken store." After making such a huge boast, the Grim Reaper paid for the meal.

70
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,940
- About that, I was a bit distracted, so--
- How could you have been distracted the whole time?

71
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,420
I mean, if you weren't even going to pay, why are you so curious about the relationship between my boss and Grim Reaper?

72
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,310
Why didn't you just ask her what she can see in you? Seriously, men are all the same.

73
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,130
Whether they're human, a goblin or a grim reaper.

74
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,900
It wasn't the kind of a picture you are thinking about.

75
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,100
It was that kind of a picture. I told you not to keep secrets from me anymore.

76
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,850
Ah, were you waiting for this day? Is that why you brought me to that chicken store? Because my boss was pretty?

77
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,220
I'm telling you now, but how could I have picked that part-time job for you?

78
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,390
What are you talking about now?

79
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,450
All I did was narrow the choices. I narrowed it down to chicken stores, so it would be easier.

80
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,330
And if I told you that you were going to be hired, then you would gain confidence. And another person would hire you.

81
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,940
Such crappy lies.

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,600
What lies?

83
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,250
Then I have two wishes that haven't come true yet. Part-time and boyfriend.

84
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,770
Why do you keep hanging onto the boyfriend part?

85
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,810
Should I break Tae Hee's legs and confirm whether or not I'm your boyfriend or not?

86
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,570
If I break something, maybe then you will go, "That's right, my boyfriend is a foul-tempered Goblin!"

87
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,040
Why is he the one getting angry?

88
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,220
What? I didn't say anything.

89
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,290
Seeing you work there, it made me feel bad. It's the first time I've seen you there properly.

90
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,050
Good night.

91
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
Are you doing well?

92
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,420
I finally... seem to be doing well.

93
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,740
What about the ring? I'll take the ring for a little and then I'll give it back--

94
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,040
If you tell me the reason.

95
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,940
I have something to investigate. The details of the investigation are a bit classified.

96
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,160
But, Sunny, why did you grab this particular ring on that day?

97
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,470
It seemed like it was mine.

98
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,150
When you wore the ring, did you feel something?

99
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,490
I did. "I grabbed this ring to meet this man."

100
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,010
A man who cries the moment he sees me. A man who doesn't concede.

101
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,110
A man where our meetings are short and waiting is long.

102
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,960
But I didn't know that man would give and take the ring.

103
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,200
Here you go.

104
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,710
Thank you. I will return it soon.

105
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know how you are when it comes to investigating, but I'm not that easy going either, so share with me the results.

106
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,980
Since I have a right to that ring, too.

107
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,030
I'll go. I have to open the store.

108
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,210
I'm saying this because I'm not sure if you know, 
but I don't think that's the right dressing for that dish.

109
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh.

110
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,280
Come to your senses and prepare lunch. (Senses and lunch sound similar)

111
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,630
Did you fail to take away the ring?

112
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,760
I just borrowed it for a little bit.

113
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,990
That's what you call taking. Why would you borrow something you gave?

114
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:11,200
I saw that you even held her hand last night. Did you see something of an enemy from your past life?

115
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Don't ask me. It's their own privacy, and even if I did see it, 
I can't say anything about it. It's one of the rules.

116
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,590
Wow, you have some conscience. So why would someone like that date a human being while hiding that you're a grim reaper?

117
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,400
Must you say things that way when you're in the same position as I am?

118
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,790
What do you mean we're in the same position? 
Mine is fateful love, and you should quit putting ketchup on tofu.

119
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,080
Oh.

120
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,410
My sister's name was also Kim Sun,

121
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,980
so I was a little bit uneasy all night.

122
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,030
You said you don't know if she reincarnated or not.

123
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:00,300
If she reincarnated with a different face, there's no way for me to recognize her. Since all I can see of humans are their fortunes.

124
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,090
Say that your sister reincarnated and you eventually met her.

125
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,450
Then what would happen? Your sister wouldn't remember anything about her past life anyway.

126
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:17,420
Just... whether she's peaceful in this lifetime, whether she's doing well.

127
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,130
If she's receiving love. I'm just curious about those things.

128
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,540
She was pretty. My little rascal.

129
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,770
Continue talking. Speaking about that.

130
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,480
About what?

131
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,590
Your story. How you lived, how you died.

132
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,490
I told you already. I was a general.
 I was in the Goryeo army.

133
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,950
Did you die on the battlefield?

134
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,470
No. I was killed by the blade of the master I was protecting.

135
00:14:55,030 --> 00:15:00,120
I don't know where or how to start. It's a story I never told.

136
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,990
The salt.

137
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,820
Oh, yeah.

138
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,660
A baby was born. And when he was born, his father who was king had already passed.

139
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,100
His mother was lowly born, and she died from an illness.

140
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,800
And his older brother who was old enough to be his father was the king.

141
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:28,910
There was no one who was on his side in the palace. Just Park Jong Won who was his teacher and a professor at Seonggyungwan.

142
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,250
After he met Park Jong Won, strange things happened around the child.

143
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,360
His nephew who was  next in  line to the throne died, and the officials who were questioning the matter died, too.

144
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,840
And eventually his older brother who was king also died.

145
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,750
They all passed away due to hereditary illness, but he finds out later

146
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,240
that they were all poisoned.

147
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,170
Both the king and the army met untimely deaths, and all that's left is regret.

148
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,890
If Yeo ascends to the royal throne,

149
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,360
please marry Yeo to your sister and protect him.

150
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:57,120
Only let him walk on the righteous path and prevent him from making the wrong choices; and more than anything,

151
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,450
please prevent him from dying.

152
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,870
And tell him that by not being there for him, I protected him.

153
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,800
And also, your master who is giving this command,

154
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,130
please forgive me.

155
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,240
I will obey your command.

156
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,990
Are you saying that he poisoned everyone over such a long period of time and made the child become the king?

157
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,330
That man, Park Jong Won did? But why...

158
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,360
With barely enough time to put on his royal attire, the child became the king.

159
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:12,430
They say that I cannot become the king because there is a separate royal lineage,

160
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,050
so I will raise and make a king myself,

161
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,020
and put this world at this king's feet,

162
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,700
and put that king at my feet.

163
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,190
Therefore, I will put the whole country at my feet.

164
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,260
May you be well for a thousand years.

165
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:40,300
According to the wishes of the late king, your marriage date has been set, Your Majesty.

166
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,050
I hear it's General Kim Shin's sister.

167
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,580
With Kim Shin's character and the family's integrity,

168
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,030
she's not lacking in any way against any other young lady.

169
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:57,590
A marriage to a petty military official's sister? It would have been nice if the late king had withheld his last wish.

170
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:03,920
The late king said that Kim Shin is a loyal subject and a reassuring comrade who fought many battles with him,

171
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,820
and said that he was a great trusted... friend.

172
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,330
The late king's last wish became a variable in Park  Jong Won's solid plans to have complete control over the king.

173
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,010
I couldn't see you since this morning,

174
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,870
so I thought I was going to get married without seeing you.

175
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,570
I should have. I have no idea what I find pretty in such an ugly face to come here.

176
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,840
Seeing how you treasure me, my path into the palace is just so pretty. 

177
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,250
But then, Orabeoni, what does the king look like?

178
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,150
Why is it that you are not curious about his character but more about his looks?

179
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,120
Don't worry. His royal appearance is very bright. 

180
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,300
Is that true?

181
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,160
What about me? Am I pretty today?

182
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,130
You look ugly.

183
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,880
Then I must be not pretty in the king's eyes? I should probably return home then?

184
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,790
The king has already seen you.

185
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,300
Me?

186
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:19,760
Perhaps... is it the one whose face was radiant?

187
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,320
So he came to see me. What did he say about me?

188
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,580
He said you were ugly.

189
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,930
You have to come see your ugly sister often.

190
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,400
Your brother lives on the battlefield. 

191
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,020
Here, no news is good news.

192
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,520
As if I didn't know.

193
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,780
Don't worry about me. I will be happy, Orabeoni.

194
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,140
♬   When I look at you  ♬

195
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,990
♬  I don't know why my tears keep falling  ♬

196
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,210
His Majesty's coming.

197
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:34,220
♬   Were you coming to circle around me?  ♬

198
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,240
♬  This love that can't be avoided>  ♬

199
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,810
♬  I love you, love you, love you.   ♬

200
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:55,450
♬ I could feel we were fated to be ♬

201
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,050
♬  And I miss you, miss you   ♬

202
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:09,200
♬ You are my fated person   ♬

203
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,030
You're heavy.

204
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,110
Ah!

205
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,990
I was thinking of someone who is cold-hearted.

206
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,070
Where are you going in such a rush?

207
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,450
To see the king.

208
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,310
I would have come to you.

209
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,330
I thought it would be better if we both came out.

210
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:02,290
You must control the strength with which you hold that lowly thing in your hand.

211
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,990
If your grasp is tight as though you treasure it, that lowly and precious thing 

212
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,570
will die without fail.

213
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,410
Because of that  hand, 

214
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,270
a foolish child, a lowly maternal family, 

215
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,710
a wife's family that is even lower than your mother's family. 

216
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,630
  I am told Chancellor Shin Cheol Joo said this 

217
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,300
 to several ministers and military officers at a drinking party three days ago

218
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,560
Is there nothing wrong in what you said?

219
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,560
The more there isn't anything wrong, the more you say it's wrong!

220
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,230
Cut off the head of Shin Cheol Joo who put the royal family to contempt 

221
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:53,740
and insist he's wrong. Show them your power. 

222
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,080
Don't confuse the king anymore.

223
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,590
Please do not cover his eyes any longer.

224
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,970
The chancellor's death was not a proper treatment. 

225
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:13,380
Everyone says I did no wrong. Only you say I did. 

226
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,950
- Must you really— 
- Did I cover his eyes

227
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,400
or did His Majesty close his eyes? 

228
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,210
- You knave!
- You bitch!

229
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,650
The late king gave him life but I raised him. 

230
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,470
There is no reason why I am not Yeo's father.

231
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:34,810
The one who put Yeo on the royal throne and the one
 who put the world in Yeo's grasp, that's all me. 

232
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,640
Did I say anything wrong?

233
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,640
So, just some lowly sister of some petty military officer,

234
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,300
cease your admonitions. 

235
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,860
I'm not the one you should be lecturing to. It's your older brother.

236
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,250
To the borders where he was sent to be buried, 

237
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,980
he is still victorious.

238
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,420
Isn't that will of his quite vicious? 

239
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,860
They are saying there are two kings to one nation. 

240
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,010
Two suns in one sky.

241
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,770
If that is not treason then...

242
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,960
what is?

243
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,290
 Put down that sword which is full of rage and apprehension.

244
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,090
Go as far as possible, and as much as possible, never return.

245
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:02,200
By that, you mean ... Your Majesty, how can you say that?

246
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,280
It is Your Majesty's Goryeo.

247
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,890
I defended its borders because you ordered me to protect them.

248
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,750
and I destroyed the enemies because you ordered me to kill them.

249
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,730
- When my sister is in this country, and so are the citizens, how can--.

250
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,720
I see now you're worrying about things

251
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,220
that a king should be worried about.

252
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,720
Send a message that you died a heroic death and I will send a message that I lament it. 

253
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,520
It's a king's order.

254
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,760
Please don't be biased against a miliary officer.

255
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,020
May you not treat him lowly for being a military officer.

256
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,940
May you

257
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,360
summon Great General Kim Shin who is near the borders to be at your side to protect you. 

258
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
And more than anything,

259
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,290
I hope you keep Park Jong Won far away.

260
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:08,040
In the end this is what it comes to.

261
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,500
Your low origin, in the end, has only become greed.  

262
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,630
Did your brother say you are the only hope for your family of low status?  

263
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,510
- Your Majesty ...
- The king protects his people.

264
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:23,380
How could the people protect its king?

265
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,060
Do you even know what you are requesting now? 
The person that you are calling your brother...

266
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,830
He keeps coming back from battles that are not supposed to be won. 

267
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,050
He has become a god in the streets.

268
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,690
I told him not to come back but he comes back time after time to show my incompetence. 

269
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,390
Your brother, how would I know if he would protect me or stab me with that sword?

270
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,900
Your Majesty ...

271
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,020
More than anyone, no one can be a god for my people.

272
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,290
That is what treason is. 

273
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,730
Your Majesty.

274
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,500
A petty military officer is gaining power.

275
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,630
As the military officer's power grows, the royal family is put into a dire crisis. 

276
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,310
Strike the head of Great General Kim Shin. 

277
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,650
Insist he's wrong and show your power. 

278
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,620
From Park Jong Won's mouth,

279
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,510
Kim Shin's name came out in the end.

280
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,730
That is... the last image of my sister.

281
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,790
She was the sister of a military officer and a noble queen.

282
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,900
The path to the king was too far.

283
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,960
In the end I could not reach him.

284
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,460
Even though I knew I could not reach it... even after knowing that... I...

285
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,330
I could only go forward.

286
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,770
That place was my last battle and I was to die there.

287
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,260
Why on earth?

288
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:49,380
I returned in violation of the royal command. I disregarded the young king's jealousy and fears.

289
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,750
I couldn't forget the late king's plea to protect Yeo.

290
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,750
I needed to save the lives of the innocent.

291
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,230
And above all else, my sister was protecting that dummy's life with her life.

292
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,220
I've blabbered too much in front of someone who doesn't have any memories of his past life.

293
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,700
The food is all cold.

294
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,530
I have one more thing I am curious about.

295
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,900
Perhaps, have you seen a ring like this?

296
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,830
You didn't take that back to give to me, right?
 I don't want to be in that kind of relationship with you.

297
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,360
Concentrate please. Look at it properly. Have you seen this?

298
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,060
You, perhaps do you wish you were my sister?

299
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,030
Is that why you asked about my past? Put on the ring. Let's see what happens.

300
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,260
Don't come close. Don't come close, I said!

301
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,030
Sun, are you receiving love now?

302
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,830
Ahhhh!

303
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,080
I'm sorry for disrupting your cozy time.

304
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,610
- It's not cozy!
- I will go out somewhere first.

305
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,330
Where are you going? Let's go together. We have to be a set now.

306
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,530
That's right. You two go out as a set.

307
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,900
- I want to be alone now.
- My Sun also liked to be alone.

308
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,760
Leave. I said, leave!

309
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,670
Jeong Hyeon told me that I must come see her with flowers.

310
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,090
She said she's in Paju.

311
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,690
It's nice since it's closer than Canada.

312
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:24,910
Ahjusshi, you really match well with flowers.

313
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,100
Any flower.

314
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,170
Ahjusshi,  you are really my style. In every way.

315
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,340
Ahjusshi,  you have a really good personality.

316
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,330
Did I do something wrong?

317
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,310
- No.
- Then did you do something wrong?

318
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,080
No.

319
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,310
Then what is this confession suddenly out of the blue?

320
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,620
Comfort? Encouragement? There is something like that.

321
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,150
How am I your style specifically?

322
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,510
Strange and beautiful.

323
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:36,620
It's here. Go Jeong Hyeon.

324
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,840
I'm here.

325
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,050
Mom?

326
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,030
Mom... I think it's her.

327
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,790
It is Mom.

328
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,600
Miser. Door, door. To the library. Hurry!

329
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,630
Be careful! You might fall!

330
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,430
Were you my mom's friend?

331
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,630
Miss. Do you know my mom?

332
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,710
Ji Yeon Hee. Do you know her?

333
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,410
Why would I be by your side then?

334
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,090
I was there because you are her daughter.

335
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,510
In our time, we really used an iron to laminate.

336
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,800
Yeon Hee helped me a lot with mine.

337
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,760
We promised when we were in high school that

338
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,560
when we would have babies, we would buy pretty clothes.

339
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,520
I wasn't able to give a dress but I protected Yeon Hee's money.

340
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,300
Open it. The code is 486.

341
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,780
These bankbooks... could it be?

342
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,520
Yeah. You're right.

343
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,740
The bankbook you always told your aunt you did not have.

344
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,290
That is Yeon Hee's insurance money.

345
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,600
The one on top is the most recent one.

346
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,050
So add it in for your college tuition.

347
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,500
Congratulations on passing.

348
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:03,710
Because of this... you wandered and could not go?

349
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,170
Because of me?

350
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,530
While I was wandering around,

351
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,760
I did feel the fun in watching you grow up.

352
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,270
Now, I should go and chat with Yeon Hee.

353
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,600
You're going? Now?

354
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,110
I should go and tell everything without missing a single thing to your mom.

355
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,450
Your daughter is so kind.

356
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,860
She's good in her studies, too.

357
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,690
She went to a good college.

358
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,670
♬   All my fears   ♬

359
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,690
Now, goodbye.

360
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,020
Already?

361
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,500
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

362
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,470
With my mom...

363
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,710
I hope the both of you

364
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,280
stay friends over there.

365
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,210
Goodbye.

366
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,570
♬   When you feel   ♬

367
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,740
Bye.

368
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,080
Take care, Go Jeong Hyeon.

373
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:58,150
Mom, you really had a good friend.

374
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,760
No, honestly she was my friend.

375
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,490
I liked everything you did.

376
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,170
The rice cakes and the feast.

377
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,580
The scarf and Jeong Hyeon, too.

378
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,260
Everything.

379
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,660

♬   Still here all alone   ♬

381
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:37,650
You, too. Thank you for opening the door.

382
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,870
I am that big of a person.

383
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,350
Did you just sneer at me?

384
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:51,360
Oh! Rain. It's not raining these days.

385
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,450
I'm restraining myself. NASA might come and get me.

386
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,360
It's been a long time.

387
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,220
You haven't changed a bit. You still talk informally.

388
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,620
Mr. Yoo Jae Shin!

389
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,550
I'm sorry.

390
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,690
As you can see, I am a very complicated person.

391
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,080
- I have something I want to ask of you.
- Yes.

392
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,770
There is insurance money.

393
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:24,880
One that was left before one child's mother died.

394
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,440
The child isn't turning 20 until September of next year.

395
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,190
So, as of now, this money is

396
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,490
hard to touch without the Aunt's approval.

397
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,230
So the insurance money should go to the rightful owner.

398
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,090
Rightfully.

399
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,500
You don't have to worry. I will take care of it immediately.

400
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,560
Then.

401
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,710
- One more thing.
- Yes.

402
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,100
Thank you for growing up properly.

403
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,120
I am thankful for everything.

404
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,190
My sister is dead. The child is young and the insurance money is out.

405
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,530
But you can't be the guardian if you have debt.

406
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,660
So what can you do? Humaneness is a disease, too.

407
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,400
I paid back all that debt in order to become the guardian.

408
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,540
So I got the insurance money.

409
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,200
But I can't deposit it into my account.

410
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,320
- Since you paid the debt by getting a private loan.
- That's right!

411
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,910
So, I put it first in that girl, Eun Tak's savings account.

412
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,610
But this damn bankbook kept disappearing!

413
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,790
So how happy would I be to see that bankbook?

414
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,810
I'm not sure if you understood what I said.

415
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,990
The law will understand.

416
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,750
And you acknowledged that you tried to divert the insurance money.

417
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,300
What is this?

418
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,650
What crap are you trying to pull here? Div—, what?

419
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,290
Because I was so worried about our delicate Eun Tak,

420
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,090
I raised her preciously like some gold or jade!

421
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,700
Stop saying such nonsense.

422
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,290
I will offer you two choices. One:

423
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,350
A simple and an efficient way, return the full amount back to Ms. Ji Eun Tak.

424
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,410
Two:  Dirtily insist on getting back child rearing expenses

425
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,310
by filing a lawsuit.

426
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,320
Please select between one and two.

427
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,000
You... You had me all wrong.

428
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:33,730
You see, I know a lot of people on the dark side.

429
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,310
I think... you are the one who has me all wrong.

430
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,350
The dark side...

431
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,830
I know better.

432
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,010
What about the Lord's situation?

433
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,740
It has been settled well. And Deok Hwa has been instructed as you have instructed.

434
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,230
Starting with one desk, one chair, he's to learn how to be a new recruit at the store first.

435
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,150
Right.

436
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,180
- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa?
- Yes.

437
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,420
I am Yoo Deok Hwa.

438
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,110
It's nice that this store is clean.

439
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,030
Go and work.

440
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,360
This is the details about the products.

441
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,620
You should memorize this by tomorrow.

442
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,680
Ohh! It goes up! It goes down!

443
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,700
Woah! It slants.

444
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,710
- Woah! You're still standing.
- Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa!

445
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,600
That... Manager Jang Il Ryeong,

446
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,830
if you were to know the truth, you would be really surprised.

447
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,590
Someone surprising that's from way up there who starts from the bottom.

448
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,380
I know that you are the Chairman's grandson.

449
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,530
He instructed that we follow the field manual. (army-like discipline.)

450
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:53,430
Exactly. If I memorize this all in one day,

451
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,060
you would probably be surprised.

452
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,990
Yes, customer. What brings you here?

453
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,160
To get the hat that I left for dry cleaning.

454
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,720
Ahhh! That hat!

455
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,460
That hat's material was so good.

456
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,040
Is it from Italy?

457
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,350
It's "Made in Heaven."

458
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,490
Ahhh... no wonder.

459
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,010
The materials there are good. Just a moment.

460
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,870
Oh! Why did it suddenly get so cold?

461
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,390
- Hello?
- Are you still investigating?

462
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,690
I haven't been lax about it.

463
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,080
Yes, not yet.

464
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,130
It must be a complicated investigation.

465
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,760
What were you doing right now?

466
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,100
I was thinking about

467
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,090
if I should hold your hand once more or not.

468
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,330
I'm going crazy.

469
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:21,240
Then, can't you come and hold me today when I'm still a year younger?

470
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,070
Today?

471
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,380
I'm going out.

472
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,270
Don't call me from now on.

473
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:36,110
Is it today?

474
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,390
- What is?
- Can you not wear that coat today?

475
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,610
Why? Is it strange?

476
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,030
Never mind.

477
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,730
I was hoping that my advice could be a variable to your day but...

478
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:55,250
Wear more comfortable shoes. The way back will be long.

479
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,470
Your clothes are strange.

480
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,760
When the laundry is done, just hang those up!

481
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,430
He disgustingly doesn't do any housework.

482
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,760
Lucky wench.

483
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,470
Someone is just eating chicken feet at home.

484
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,880
Having a man to date.

485
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:13,040
December 31st date, you say.

486
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,450
I'm so proud of you, friend.

487
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,530
Today's date concept is...

488
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,830
sweet and warm.

489
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,470
- Is it pretty?
- Disgustingly pretty.

490
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,750
I can't make it obvious that I am one year older on a date.

491
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,850
I am sorry for being late. It is hard to walk if there are a lot of people.

492
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,420
But you came before I'm a year older. Should we walk towards Bosingak? (a bell pavillion)

493
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,020
Before that, I will hold your hand.

494
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,850
Right away? This suddenly?

495
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,520
Because I am too curious to wait.

496
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,820
Human nature is quite strange, don't you think? It makes me want to play hard to get.

497
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,160
- Do you want to hold my hand?
- Yes.

498
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,830
Me, too.

499
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,030
I want to hold your hand and hug you.

500
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,630
But then, at the least, whose hand I am holding

501
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,360
or whose embrace I am in, I need to know.

502
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,820
You still haven't answered my question properly.

503
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,340
What is your identity, Mr. Kim Woo Bin?

504
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,270
You still have not answered as to how you knew my real name.

505
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:11,500
Just letting things pass because you're handsome is only up to this year.

506
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,700
And after two hours,  it will be next year.

507
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,640
Am I asking for too much?

508
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,540
I'm sorry.

509
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,280
Okay.

510
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,470
Then should we stop?

511
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,550
Making me walk in the inner part of the pavement is cute.

512
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:00,190
You were cute too when you were answering those math questions.

513
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,370
Everything is good, but...

514
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,030
I don't think I can do it anymore.

515
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,270
I'll just get dumped.

516
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,810
Don't contact me from now on.

517
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,600
Don't greet me even if we see each other coincidentally, too.

518
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,990
Happy New Year!

519
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,950
Ahjusshi, Ahjusshi!

520
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:19,020
Come in.

521
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,330
What is it? I was sleeping.

522
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,120
- Like that? 
- Yeah, this is how I always sleep. Why?

523
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,810
I got it. Listen carefully, Ahjusshi.

524
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,740
What?

525
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:43,920
Ahjusshi, 12 o'clock strikes! January 1st, the New Year! I just became an adult!

526
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:47,460
So what about it? What do you want? Why are you all dressed?

527
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,870
I've got a prior appointment. I'm going out. Since I'm an adult now.

528
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:52,390
You?

529
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:54,500
What prior appointment in this late at night? Are you out of your--

530
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,310
It's a prior appointment with you.

531
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,280
So I already got dressed since earlier . . .

532
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,180
Dummy, must I say it in words?

533
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,270
Yea. Say it from now on instead of drying up my blood. (Torturing him.)

534
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:08,040
Go out? What do you want to do?

535
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,750
You'll do it for me?

536
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,910
Whatever it is, if you say to do it, I'll do that, too.

537
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:20,100
Ahjusshi. Alcohol. Alcohol. Buy me alcohol.

538
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,690
At the street bar. Soju and chicken gizzard. And romance, too.

539
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,780
What?

540
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,330
Then, let's go, into romance!

541
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,630
Here, toast between adults.

542
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,640
Are you going to be okay...

543
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,920
It's romantic.

544
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,120
Oh, bitter. Is soju supposed to be bitter?

545
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,340
Alcohol is all supposed to be bitter. When that becomes sweet is when you're really an adult.

546
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,730
Then, one more cup. Pour it. Fill it.

547
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,760
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

548
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,970
♬ Love, even when the moonlit night falls.♬

549
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,850
Oh sweet... bitter.

550
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,130
Bitter.

551
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:16,720
Nice picture.

552
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,590
♬  You and I feel the same ♬

553
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,880
What's this trite development?

554
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,300
Did you hire them?

555
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,110
I didn't but I have met him before.

556
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,240
I just knew you lived in this neighborhood.

557
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,620
I was looking very hard for you.

558
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,640
It's him. The punk that did this to me.

559
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,310
He wrecked my hand like this and what a good life he has to be playing with a chick.

560
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,350
You'll die today.

561
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:47,650
Today? Really? Tell me everything you see.

562
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:50,280
What is he saying?

563
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,040
For your amusement.

564
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,500
Eat the food and wait. Wait for me with the drinks. I'll be short.

565
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,460
Our battlefield is outside. Come out.

566
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,070
What? Where did he go?

567
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:07,530
I told you he's weird.

568
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,670
Let's go outside.

569
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,190
Are you sure it's okay for your boyfriend to go out like that?

570
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:18,230
Those guys are infamously wicked in this neighborhood.

571
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:22,920
Oh, it's okay. He's not a mister who goes around getting beat up.

572
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,860
Auntie, one more bottle of soju.

573
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:39,130
Shall I deal with you in a classic way after some time of absence from it? I used to be a military officer.

574
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:43,790
And I'm currently unemployed, bastard. Thanks to you.

575
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:48,460
How can that be the life of a great man? The same goes for you guys.

576
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:54,160
That's the reason I won't be easy on you today. It'll hurt. Endure if you want.

577
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,360
What is he saying?

578
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,920
Hey, break him into pieces.

579
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,650
Nice.

580
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:52,760
Hurry.

581
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:00,230
Let's start from the beginning again, the romance.

582
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,990
It's still romantic?

583
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,290
More than earlier.

584
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:16,530
Fading light, simple food, bitter soju,

585
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:23,140
cold-hearted sentiment, romance brimming everywhere.

586
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,970
It'd be perfect with just one more thing.

587
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,330
What?

588
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,660
My first kiss.

589
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,450
What?

590
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:36,460
Last time, it was a peck. Don't move.

591
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,570
Hey.

592
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,550
You...

593
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,710
You forgot I'm the goblin bride? It doesn't work on me.

594
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,700
It means you can't ever evade me no matter what.

595
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:12,330
I wasn't evading.

596
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:14,520
It was hard to evade you even once.

597
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,080
♬ Beautiful love   ♬

598
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,020
♬  If I am with you under the same sky  ♬

599
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:31,830
♬  Just breathing is good  ♬

600
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:35,970
♬  It's a beautiful life, beautiful day,  ♬

601
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:40,710
♬  I will live in your memory.    ♬

602
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:49,440
♬  Beautiful life, beautiful day, stay by myside ♬

603
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,690
♬  Beautiful my love,  ♬

604
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,910
♬   Beautiful your heart.    ♬

605
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,650
♬  It's a beautiful life    ♬

606
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,360
It's perfect.

607
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:12,500
♬ It's a beautiful life   ♬

608
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:20,530
Did she get dumped or did I get dumped?

609
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,700
What are you doing, Miscellaneously Omitted person?

610
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,490
So what are you doing?

611
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,870
Good morning.

612
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:50,270
It's New Year's and I'm thankful to you, too, so I was making rice cake soup.

613
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,760
I made buckwheat jelly, too.

614
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,220
You're precious starting from New Year's already.

615
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,980
My pay from the ski resort came in so I bought good beef, too.

616
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:01,960
No beef in my rice cake.

617
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,490
Yes.

618
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:12,340
It seems like yesterday when you guys walked towards me like models through the night fog.

619
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:17,670
It's already New Year's. Back then, you guys were so dashing.

620
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,060
Amidst being scared, you guys looked so totally dashing.

621
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,030
Wait a bit.

622
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,550
Oh, green onion! I didn't buy green onions.

623
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:29,600
Rice cake soup without green onions will be quite hopeless.

624
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,560
Green onions are important indeed. Shall we go?

625
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,200
Shall we then?

626
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:46,470
♬  See ya never gone my way  ♬

627
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,170
♬  Better will some day  ♬

628
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,740
♬  Never far away  ♬

629
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,500
♬  See ya never gone my way  ♬

630
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:08,660
Move over! Do you guys own this?

631
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:18,410
It seems he just gave us a word of blessing for the new year, to use the sidewalk.

632
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:23,920
I'm grateful for your blessing so I shall not do you harm. May you have a good new year.

633
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,000
Since we are dashing. Happy New Year!

634
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:33,340
- A righteous buddy he is.
- Rare in today's world.

635
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,030
It's beautiful.

636
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:46,950
Enjoy.

637
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,460
I will be able to enjoy it if it tastes good...

638
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,040
I'm a good cook. Have lots of good fortune in the new year, both of you.

639
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,990
You get lots of blessings, too.

640
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,540
I broke up with Sunny.

641
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,690
What did she say when you broke up?

642
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,370
She said, "I'll just get dumped."

643
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,270
What she means is,  since I got dumped, you call me first.

644
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,430
That's what that means.

645
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:12,630
She asked about my identity.

646
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,640
That's a tough one.

647
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,170
But a grim reaper is a little bit negative, so how about you say you're an angel?

648
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:23,230
It's the same genre.

649
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,000
Be strong. Fighting.

650
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,840
That's how everyone grows up. At age 300, it's the toughest time.

651
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:33,800
It's okay.

652
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:37,970
- What?
- One fact, again.

653
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,710
In order to earn the answer, go near the one who is close to the answer.

654
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:44,100
What are you talking about?

655
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,990
What is this? Let go.

656
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,760
Indeed, I see nothing from you. Just warmth.

657
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,730
My fingers. It hurts.

658
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,360
Hey, what are you going to do about my hand?

659
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,530
Thanks for the rice cake soup.

660
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:00,590
My hand. What about my hand?

661
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,640
My hand. Filthy.

662
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,770
Filthy. I need to cut it off.

663
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:12,730
Disinfection. That should do, right?

664
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,730
It's good.

665
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,760
It's all disinfected. I'm fine now. Don't worry.

666
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,170
So pay me back for the rice cake soup, okay?

667
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,980
Why are we coming here? You said to go to the supermarket.

668
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,570
That's roasted sweet potatoes!

669
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:39,820
This is seriously the first time I'm eating roasted sweet potatoes. Seriously, really, for real the first time.

670
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,980
It's not that you're eating roasted sweet potatoes for the first time, but the first time you're acting as if you're eating them for the first time.

671
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,850
Oh my world. Indeed it's such a small world we live in nowadays.

672
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:56,190
How could a coincidence like this happen, right?

673
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:59,200
What are you doing? Before such a coincidence?

674
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:03,550
You two aren't going to say hi?

675
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:06,090
We agreed not to say hi even if we meet by coincidence.

676
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,400
You agreed not to say hi?

677
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,050
You two, the overall look is like yellow yolk and eggwhite.

678
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,970
Fried egg.

679
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,500
Sorry.

680
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:37,310
Bean sprouts. The string and the head.

681
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,600
You like bean sprouts.

682
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,330
You ruined everything. Everything.

683
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,760
No, their outfits...

684
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,700
Sorry. I shouldn't have included this ahjusshi in our strategy.

685
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,370
It's okay. At least I got to see Sunny.

686
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:15,170
Also, you don't even have $5, so why insist on eating roasted sweet potatoes?

687
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,040
I mean,  what are we supposed to do when two of you who look normal don't even have $5 together?

688
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,320
Just when you think you know.

689
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,410
My boss paid for this. What are you going to do about it?

690
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:25,770
$5 was a variable I didn't think of.

691
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,070
- Next time, I will for sure have cash in advance. 
- Never mind.

692
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:34,040
Today, our plan failed without any gains thanks to you.

693
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,130
Uh-uh, the plan failed but we did gain something.

694
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:39,650
Look at this man.

695
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,570
I'm going to work.

696
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:54,530
My concept today was... an angel.

697
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,790
It's all your fault then.

698
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:00,980
Oh my god!

699
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,690
CEO, over here. 

700
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,150
I look really natural, right? I don't look like an illegal alien, right? 

701
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,670
I don't look like someone who's come abroad for the first time, right?

702
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:03,450
So in the end, she bought that?

703
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,740
To meet with that CEO or whatever.

704
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,130
So I was supposed to buy that for her.

705
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,300
She said she was the one who got dumped.

706
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:07,270
But why do I keep feeling like I got dumped. I don't know.

707
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:10,530
Each person has a different time frame for healing from

708
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,000
wounded feelings from a breakup.

709
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,730
Instead of focusing on recovering quickly, focus on where you can recover.

710
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,950
Focus.

711
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:26,400
Thank you for the consultation, Doctor.

712
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,150
Have some tea. It will erase your memory of this life.

713
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,350
Such a waste on my studies.

714
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:39,360
Why did I bother getting a medical degree and throw away my youth?

715
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,410
You were my last patient.

716
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:52,580
Thank you for making the time for me.

717
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,110
I'm here, My Lord. Are you on your way back from somewhere?

718
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:06,840
I just had something to buy briefly.

719
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:13,270
I can't sleep and I was feeling lonesome so I thought I could come and play a round of Baduk.

720
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:19,630
The candlesticks and the tableware, I'll set a day to get them cleaned.

721
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:23,400
I'll do it when the weather's good, so don't worry.

722
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,840
Then, shall we play a round of Baduk which we haven't played for so long?

723
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:36,800
When you were young, I was the one who taught you Baduk but lately, I keep losing to you.

724
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,560
Because I play it like it's life or death.

725
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,510
And I don't?

726
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:51,910
It's a horse surrounded, My Lord. I'm not giving it back to you no matter what.

727
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,980
Let's see...

728
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:23,940
Stay immortal alone and watch your loved ones die. 

729
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:27,620
You will never forget any deaths. 

730
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,510
Are you going somewhere nice, Mr. Chairman?

731
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:37,800
Yes, I think I might be.

732
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:59,490
Day drinking is always nice.

733
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:02,340
Day drinking is cold now.

734
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,240
Did something happen?

735
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,510
A namecard will come.

736
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,610
Ji Eun Tak's namecard?

737
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:13,120
No. Chairman Yoo.

738
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:20,250
Did you tell Chairman Yoo?

739
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:23,970
Is there anything to gain from a human knowing their own death?

740
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:28,810
Then what about Deok Hwa? It'd be better if he knew no matter what.

741
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:31,830
So he can have no regret. Isn't it better to tell him?

742
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:35,240
Before death, everything is a regret.

743
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:46,530
Chairman Yoo asked about your well-being. Asking if the visiting friend is doing well.

744
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:50,660
I guess he is just asking when he knows it all already.

745
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,370
About what? That you got dumped?

746
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,250
Did you try to call her?

747
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:02,090
No. If I do, I think I really need to make a coming out.

748
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:07,480
You look so obviously like a grim reaper. Maybe she's slow.

749
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:13,840
Is that it?

750
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,100
- What? 
- What you sense from Sunny.

751
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,750
There's more, of course.

752
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,310
- There is? 
- I sensed that that woman has a name that is too great for her.

753
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,150
To have the same name as my sister?

754
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:29,570
It's a relief that you guys broke up. I disliked so many things about her every time I met her.

755
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:33,450
And she has no sense of logic at all.

756
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,380
I think you should stop criticizing Sunny.

757
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,890
You're taking her side?

758
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:46,210
There's something I didn't tell you. That I saw Sunny's past life.

759
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:46,940
You said it was a secret.

760
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:50,650
Sunny seems to be a reincarnation of your younger sister.

761
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:52,260
Sunny is? Not you?

762
01:11:52,260 --> 01:12:00,430
Sunny's face in a previous life is the same as the face of the woman in the portrait

763
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,750
you have.

764
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,970
You're sure of it?

765
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:13,550
What did you see?

766
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:19,950
The woman I saw was standing in a spot in a palace.

767
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:24,780
She was wearing white and her ranking seemed high.

768
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:33,090
She was shot in the chest by an arrow and she collapsed while bleeding.

769
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,120
I told you that.

770
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:46,730
Maybe not the white clothes, but the arrow... I don't think I said that.

771
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:50,460
What else? Did you see anything else?

772
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:56,530
While she was riding in a palanquin when she saw someone, she smiled, through a small window.

773
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:59,390
She smiles as she asks,

774
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:02,240
- "Am I..."
- "Am I pretty today?"

775
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:09,810
A voice answered her.

776
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,220
- "You're ugly." 
- "You're ugly."

777
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:20,040
♬  See ya never gone my way  ♬

778
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:24,180
♬  Never will some day  ♬

779
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,880
Is it really

780
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,060
your younger sister?

781

♬  Round and round and I never  ♬

785
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,070
♬  Know why  ♬

786
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,420
♬  Round and round and it will show  ♬

787
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:56,570

The time I shared with you 

797
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:57,210
was blindingly bright.

01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:02,080
Because the day was good, because the day was not good

799
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:07,400
Because the day was just right. I loved each and every day.
