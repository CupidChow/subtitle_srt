Goblin

4
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,320
Sunny's face in her past life and the woman in your painting

5
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,550
are the same.

6
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,830
Are you sure?

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,490
What did you see?

8
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,800
The woman that I saw was standing in a spot of the palace.

9
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,750
She was wearing white and her ranking seemed high.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,470
She was shot in the chest by an arrow

11
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,020
and she collapsed while bleeding.

12
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,870
I told you that.

13
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:44,570
Maybe not the white clothes, but the arrow... I don't think I said that.

14
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,290
What else? Did you see anything else?

15
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,880
While she was riding in a palanquin

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,440
when she saw someone she smiled through a small window.

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,870
She smiles as she asks, "Am I ..."

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,050
Am I pretty today?

19
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,650
And there was a voice that answered her question.

20
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,000
- "You're ugly." 
- "You're ugly."

21
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it really...

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,350
your  younger sister?

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,290
It's her.

24
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,690
Then... what happens now?

25
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,090
- Episode 11 -

26
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,060
Welcome.

27
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,360
The part-time worker is out...

28
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,830
for delivery.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,350
Seon.

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,640
Why are you calling my name?

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
Seon.

32
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,700
Aren't you crazy? Are you just going to watch?

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,290
We still do not know for sure. So you should refrain on the skinship.

34
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,210
Are you really Seon?

35
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,270
So what if I am Seon? What's with this person?

36
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,330
There is a deep story behind it...

37
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,580
What deep story would I have with this Orabeoni?

38
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,250
That's right, it's me. I'm your Orabeoni.

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,420
I missed you, Seon.

40
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,370
It's Sunny, I said!

41
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,810
And also, didn't we agree not to see each other?

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,570
What kind of man would go around with someone after being called a fried egg?

43
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,400
That is... That person is your brother in your past life.

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,080
W-What did you say? Past life, what? Driving me crazy.

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,640
So you made up that ridiculous ghost story just to come see me?

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,160
You must have missed me.

47
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,640
Who could I speak to, Seon? (spoken formally)

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,770
Do you really have no memory of the past?

49
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,260
You are clothed properly and you look normal...

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,350
Right, let's hear it out. What was I in my past life?

51
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,870
You were Goryeo's Queen and I was a General.

52
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,400
Goryeo.

53
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,330
Do you remember?

54
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,650
I remember... roasted sweet potato... $5. Give it to me!

55
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,880
Past life? Queen?

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,950
Even if I try to believe you, seriously. Get out. Won't you get out?

57
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,220
You go out, too!

58
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,800
Seon!

59
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,510
You two, when did you come?

60
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,500
Why... Did something happen?

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,720
Part-time worker,  throw some salt down. (to ward off evil)  
There should be a sackful of it over there.

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
How... I don't know how to explain it.

63
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
- If you don't know, then don't. 
 - Yes.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,440
Seon.

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,010
What happened?

66
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,590
Let's exchange information.

67
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,170
What are Kim Shin and my boss?

68
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,870
Ex-girlfriend... It doesn't seem like it.

69
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,890
If she was his ex-girlfriend then you wouldn't just sit here like this.

70
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,730
You should be all dark and gloomy.

71
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,600
Yeah. It's not that at all.

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,530
- My question.
- Secret.

73
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,500
I haven't asked yet.

74
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,510
"Are there other guys who come to see your boss?"

75
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,990
You're going to ask those kind of questions.

76
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,840
But why is it a secret? I told you everything, so why is yours a secret?

77
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,650
Loyalty!

78
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,640
It's the persimmon that you loved to eat, Seon.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,390
It's the shoe you wanted to have, Seon.

80
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,240
It's the colors that you used to like, Seon.

81
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,140
I don't like those colors.

82
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,480
I don't wear traditional shoes.

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,830
I don't eat persimmon.

84
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,090
As you can see, this is the only table left. Business has been doing well.

85
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,510
It's because I have been here. I am a god of luck.

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,810
You just live here, don't you?

87
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,670
I was on my way out. Come home early.

88
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,380
Part-time worker, does it have to be that man?

89
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,710
Must you meet him?

90
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,340
- Pardon? 
- If you must, then go and tell him.

91
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,520
If he's going to bring persimmon, traditional shoes, and clothes,

92
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,520
he should just come empty-handed and leave with some chicken in those hands.

93
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,840
That that's the way for him to care for you.

94
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,960
I know. What's the matter with him?

95
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,000
The fact that I'm imagining these things about my boss and your uncle

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,950
really makes me feel guilty and I don't like it. But I'm telling you, your Uncle lives at our store now.

97
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,940
And I keep being feeling awkward with Mr. Reaper for no reason.

98
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,690
That is because your boss is the younger sister of my uncle in his past life.

99
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,320
Huh?

100
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,610
Why?

101
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,840
Past life? Impossible.

102
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,400
But how would you know that?

103
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,690
Should I tell you a secret?

104
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes.

105
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,370
Grim Reapers see the past life of a human once he touches them.

106
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,230
Really?

107
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,210
I'm sure that those two held hands. And that's why Uncle down the hall told him about it.

108
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,970
That's right! I saw them hold hands.

109
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,960
Awesome!

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,650
Are you sure that woman is my sister? Did you see anything else?

111
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,110
Nothing.

112
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,980
I wanted to try once more, but with "I will be the one to get dumped" I failed.

113
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,140
Don't be too upset. She doesn't remember her past life.

114
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,480
I know.

115
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,610
Even if that woman is Seon from my past life, to that woman, I am just a ghost story.

116
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,870
Because that woman has a current life to live.

117
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,540
I feel like maybe the past should be left as the past.

118
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,210
It would have been better if I did all of those before... when my time and my sister's time were the same.

119
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,310
She was such a warm and dignified child.

120
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,140
How did she end up with such a different personality?

121
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,530
What's wrong with Sunny's personality?

122
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,700
Only just recently you went and called her "Seon" out of the blue, but now she's not?

123
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,600
You wish it's not her?

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,610
Didn't you break up? Why are you being riled up?

125
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,890
Perhaps, if you have thoughts of dating her again then quit that.

126
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,130
How could the likes of a grim reaper loiter around my sister who is a human?

127
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,270
I think your thought earlier was good.

128
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,610
We should let the past be left as the past.

129
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,340
Before dirt covers  my eyes (to be dead and  buried), you can never be the one.

130
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,870
Get away from my sister! If there were water, I would have poured it on you.

131
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,670
I know this drama though.

132
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,350
I saw it a lot in the mornings.

133
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,400
Part-time worker, perhaps do you believe in past lives and such?

134
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,330
Yes.

135
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,050
You believe it?

136
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,590
They say a human has four lives.

137
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,700
A life where you scatter seeds, a life that waters the scattered seeds,

138
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,300
a life of harvesting those seeds, and a life to use what you harvested.

139
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,360
The fact that there are four lives like this, doesn't that mean there's a past life and a rebirth?

140
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,410
Even thought neither you or I know which number we are living now.

141
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,680
That sounds legit. Where did you hear that?

142
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm usually good at hearing this and that as I go.

143
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,660
What else? What else have you heard?

144
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:06,100
Even though I knew I could not reach it... even after knowing that... I...could only go forward.

145
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,950
That place was my last battle and I was to die there.

146
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,540
Why on earth?

147
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:20,640
I returned in violation of the royal command. I disregarded the young king's jealousy and fears..

148
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,440
I couldn't forget the late king's plea to protect Yeo.

149
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,850
I had to save the lives of the innocent.

150
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,610
And above all else,

151
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,390
my sister was protecting that dummy's life with her life.

152
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:44,010
That the person named Kim Seon was a very brave person in front of love.

153
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,380
Lead the way, part-timer. To the house of the man who claims to be my Orabeoni (brother) in my past life.

154
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,940
Pardon?

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,910
I'm back.

156
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,510
We have a guest, everyone...

157
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,300
You live together, the both of you?

158
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,310
Like this, the three of us. But what brings you here?

159
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,960
"Have a seat" should be first!

160
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,800
Have a seat, Boss. Should I get you something to drink?

161
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,010
Do you have alcohol? Soju.

162
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,940
- Pardon?
- We have beer. Since we only drink beer.

163
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,430
I didn't say you could talk to me.

164
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,310
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,990
How, with that personality...

166
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,820
I heard I'm your younger sister.

167
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,270
You said it was a ghost story.

168
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,440
Show me some evidence. I'm the one who is confused here.

169
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,310
but I didn't think that two grown men would team up just to play a prank on me.

170
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,250
Is this your proof?

171
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,580
So, where did you buy it?

172
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,540
Insadong?

173
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,520
This person is that queen?

174
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,460
Your sister?

175
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,430
It's so fascinating. Boss always waited for a king.

176
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,240
Does anything... come to mind?

177
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,590
Just... she's young

178
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,600
and pretty.

179
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,880
When I was this age I was ugly.

180
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,490
So what happened to this queen?

181
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,570
Did she live happily ever after?

182
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
You two should talk.

183
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,740
We will give you space.

184
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,230
Was she unhappy, this Queen?

185
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,750
Compared to the days when I saw her face,

186
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,110
there were more days where I saw her through her letters.

187
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,240
Those times when I read the letters sent from my sister,

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,610
were my only source of support during those days, when I was

189
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,510
busy trying to stay alive.

190
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,560
Hit the target!

191
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,340
Kim Shin has delivered a report of victory from the frontier.

192
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,900
Kim Shin has delivered a report of victory from the border.

193
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,000
General Kim Shin from Liaodong, report of victory...

194
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,810
News of Kim Shin's victory gets spread around the streets intentionally 

195
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,790
and the people who are foolish are getting fooled each time. 

196
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,650
 And that's all there is to a military official's resentment.

197
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,170
Do not tell him he is great. 

198
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,550
The dignity of the royal family is kicked to the streets. 

199
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,670
I worry about your sister's safety. 

200
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,420
Send that message. 

201
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,780
He has no talent in archery.

202
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,450
He's been staring at the same page for an hour.

203
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,330
He must not have a talent for studying, either.

204
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
That's not true. There must be things on his mind.

205
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,970
But how could he not even once come to see me?

206
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,980
He's really someone who makes a woman sick.

207
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,320
The King is coming.

208
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,440
You're heavy.

209
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,870
I was thinking of someone cold-hearted.

210
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,420
Where are you going in such a rush?

211
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,740
To see the King.

212
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,010
I would have come to you..

213
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,840
I thought it would be better if we both came out.

214
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,880
You must control the strength

215
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,220
with which you hold that lowly thing in your hand.

216
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,450
If your grasp is tight as though you treasure it

217
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,990
that lovely and precious thing

218
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
will die without fail.

219
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,360
Because of that hand.

220
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,930
No. You must never

221
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,810
bring any tonic to the queen's quarters.. This is a royal command.

222
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,030
The Queen shall not drink any tonic.

223
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,410
Don't drink anything that is sent to you.

224
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,540
I wonder why he's like that.

225
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,710
It makes Your Highness sad.

226
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,800
Open the door!

227
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,980
 General Kim Shin has returned in triumph!

228
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,760
Your brother is returning in triumph again.

229
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,620
Between the two of us

230
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,310
who do you wish would live?

231
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,790
- Your Highness...
- Answer me.

232
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,450
No, have you already made up your mind?

233
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,880
Well...

234
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,930
Whether I live or your brother lives

235
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,650
you have nothing to lose.

236
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,080
You are a fool. 

237
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,580
Do you wish to die?

238
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,920
Why are you dressed like that?

239
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,880
In your heart, you are already mourning.

240
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,700
Now I do not know anymore

241
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,990
if those barbarians at the border are the enemy or your brother is the enemy.

242
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,750
Park Joong Hun is the enemy.

243
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,810
You'll  have to decide.

244
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,720
To live as my woman or die as a traitor's

245
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,310
sister.

246
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,640
It was not for a long time,

247
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,150
but I feel as though she had happy moments.

248
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,680
Even in the last moment that she closed her eyes,

249
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,870
she was still looking at that dummy.

250
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,410
Then, what about the king?

251
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,870
Did the king get reincarnated, too?

252
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,620
That... I do not know.

253
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,390
What he looks like...

254
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,540
I want to see his face.

255
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,080
Was he handsome?

256
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,590
If you are my sister

257
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,900
there is one thing that's unchanged.

258
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,770
But...

259
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,970
as though you remember it all,

260
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,180
you talk about it so eagerly and ardently,

261
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,090
as if your life

262
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,920
has been continuing on since that time?

263
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,780
You might not believe it,

264
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,280
but I've been living with those memories intact.

265
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,190
I'm saying this because you know I don't believe it

266
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
but it's not that I don't believe in past life,

267
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,630
but I came because of the persimmon, shoes and clothes.

268
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,820
Not being able to give her things of that sort, I wonder if it left a deep regret in you.

269
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,810
And I am sure that you have gone mad, but I feel as though you're reasonably insane.

270
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,860
So I felt a little bad.

271
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,450
Looking at you like this,

272
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,250
it really seems you are Seon.

273
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,160
Just because you are my Orabeoni in my last life

274
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,580
don't start speaking informally to me all of a sudden.

275
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,680
Even between siblings who haven't seen each other in a long time, they would find it awkward.

276
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,750
For someone who says that he is an Orabeoni who crossed lifetimes

277
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,100
how could I welcome you gladly so suddenly?

278
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,240
So... don't feel too bad.

279
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,800
I have troubled you a lot. Then...

280
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:42,760
He didn't even come to see me off.

281
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,600
When you aren't even going to hold onto me, why are you staring at me?

282
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,390
- Can I... hold onto you? 
 - If you do,

283
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
then what happens to us next?

284
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,050
You're really bad...

285
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,940
Is it you?

286
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,820
Or not?

287
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,790
She left well?

288
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,190
That woman...

289
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,190
she always... leaves well...

290
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,760
Are you okay?

291
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,930
I am curious about something.

292
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,760
That portrait, who drew it?

293
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,450
King Yeo did.

294
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,600
Although it's my sister's appearance

295
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,770
it's the way he saw her.

296
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,920
His sorrow, sins,

297
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,850
and longing are encompassed in that painting.

298
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,890
I feel as though that could have been...

299
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,420
his last act...

300
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,610
After he killed her like that?

301
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,570
Yes, after he did all that.

302
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,530
- Part-timer?
 - Yes, it's me.

303
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,420
I thought you might be here like this.

304
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,150
I thought that past life stuff was nothing.

305
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,870
I don't even believe it.

306
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,720
But my whole body aches like I got the flu after I left that house.

307
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,040
If it's too much, let me know. And I will take you to a hospital.

308
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,940
No. To my home.

309
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,560
There isn't anything...

310
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,650
but it keeps hurting here. No...

311
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,400
somewhere deeper, it hurts.

312
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,430
A heartless someone...

313
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,700
is walking in my heart,

314
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,510
so it feels like my heart is sinking...

315
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,580
Let's go.

316
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,760
It's cold out.

317
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,100
What?

318
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,970
He lives in the rooftop house.

319
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,310
Okay, I see.

320
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,280
Watch out for the stairs.

321
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,430
The woman downstairs was friends with the Goblin bride?

322
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,380
The world is really so small.

323
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,880
I saw it in his phone.

324
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,470
What?

325
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,980
The Goblin and his wife.

326
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,790
Is that you and that person who insists he's the older brother?

327
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,390
The Goblin and his wife?

328
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,740
You won't tell me, right? Their identities.

329
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,070
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,880
He also won't tell me, right?

331
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,490
His identity.

332
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,130
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,910
I need to break up, right?

334
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,460
You... are just a person?

335
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,450
Yes.

336
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,710
Alright.

337
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
What are you doing?

338
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,690
Meeting you.

339
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,570
Since where?

340
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,350
I walked with you all the steps you walked.

341
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,510
Look how pretty you speak.

342
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,900
My boss's life is seriously...

343
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,960
I was born as Ji Eun Tak in a strange world from the start.

344
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,320
Whether I see ghosts or whether the Goblin shows up,

345
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,050
whether I encounter the Grim Reaper, that stuff isn't strange.

346
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:34,560
But my boss is suddenly being jammed into a very strange genre.

347
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,630
Her so-called older brother from a past life is a goblin and the man she likes is a grim reaper.

348
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,260
While her hired help sees ghosts.

349
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,510
There are times when there are more ghosts than customers at the store.

350
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,080
Past life. But can that really be?

351
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,410
It's just a life that's passed.

352
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,330
At some moment I myself can't remember.

353
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,510
Do you think I stuck around briefly in the life of Kim Shin?

354
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,790
Maybe?

355
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,750
I wish my boss was really your younger sister.

356
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,760
My boss is really a very good person.

357
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,050
I think not.

358
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:28,590
I guess siblings quarrel nonstop in their present life or their past life.

359
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,830
I wish I had an older brother like you, too.

360
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,960
Oh! I do have brother. Oppa Tae Hee!

361
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,970
At this rate, later on, you will just...

362
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,040
The two of you will go get some beef at the restaurant in Canada then?

363
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,300
Oh, my regular place.

364
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,750
What regular place after going there twice? I've been going there for 50 years, alright?

365
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,930
I won't go there with anyone else. I'll only go with you.

366
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,110
Yeah, right! But you did!

367
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,550
I did? Really? When?

368
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,680
How do you know?

369
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,300
I shouldn't have come to pick you up.

370
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,760
How do you know it?

371
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,150
Hey, come in. Don't pull out to the back.

372
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,150
One, two, three!

373
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,300
One more.

374
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,190
You look...

375
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,030
Model pose. Model pose.

376
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,680
Only you look good in it.

377
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,570
Only she looks . . .

378
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,980
Hello?

379
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,130
It's my number.

380
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,710
How did you know my number?

381
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:40,310
When a new school year begins, they give only to the class president something called an emergency contact list.

382
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,130
You wouldn't have received it since I was always the president for all three years.

383
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,180
Congrats on graduation. Let's keep in touch now and then.

384
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,810
Alright.

385
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,770
Congrats to you, too.

386
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,650
Now, everyone to their seats.

Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @viki.com

388
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,930
You look so grown up in regular clothes. You all worked hard for three years, everyone.

389
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,530
I'll pass on your uniforms to the next class years for you, and it'll just be tedious for me to make this long as your homeroom teacher.

390
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,670
So we end here. Congrats to you all for graduating.

391
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,230
Parents outside, come in.

392
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,860
Come and hug them to tell them they worked hard and to congratulate them.

393
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,810
Yes.

394
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,580
Hello.

395
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,460

Soo Jin's mom.

397
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,980
- Hello. 
- Hello.

398
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,310
You worked hard.

399
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,750
Ji Soo's mother.

400
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,230
- Have you been well, Teacher? 
- Thank you.

401
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,980
Oh, thank you. You worked hard.

402
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,750
Welcome.

403
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,820
You worked so hard. You mom would be so proud.

404

♬  And I'm here, just...  ♬

405
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,190
Take it home and share it with your family. For sure.

406
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,560
Why did you hug me?

407
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:52,370
Because you're adorable. When you came to exist...

408
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,960
I felt happy. 

409
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,530
I felt happy.

410
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,300
Congratulations for graduating.

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,870
Enjoy the food.

431
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,830
Thank you.

432
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:20,390
Once or twice in a hundred years, there are those who are born with the same face. 

433
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,460
[1860.  Late Joseon, King Cheol Jong's 12th year in reign]

434
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,140
What's wrong, My Lord? Is something bothering you?

435
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,500
It's nothing.

436
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,590
Now after all the stuff, I can even see a life in a faraway time.

437
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,200
What life? How far away, My Lord?

438
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,420
They clearly speak in Joseon language but they also mix in a lot of a future language. I wonder if the world is one?

439
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,320
Just when I think I know it, I don't. It's not just that, either.

440
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:17,510
They keep touching some scrap metal about the size of a half an inkstone like it's a new baby that they love and cherish.

441
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
I really don't understand what you mean...

442
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,150
It's dark but shiny, too. I think it will be in wide use.

443
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,250
Remember it.

444
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,660
It looks like this.

445
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,830
Click.

446
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,490
Click.

447
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,550
If you come to invest in it, do it big.

448
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,270
Yes, My Lord.

449
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,320
It's pretty.

450
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,580
She just stayed for a bit and left.

451
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,160
In a moment even I didn't know.

452
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,590
What are you doing?

453
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,210
Because it's strange. How did I see you since then?

454
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,220
When? Earlier in the classroom?

455
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,720
No. Way back.

456
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,780
There was a beautiful occurrence like that.

457
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:49,360
What specifically?

458
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,700
Late Joseon, in King Cheol Jong's 12th year of his reign, I met her.

459
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,970
Who?

460
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,460
My first love.

461
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:02,510
This man, seriously. It's D-A-N-C!

462
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,560
Where did you learn that language? It's not the Analects of Confucius or Mencius.

463
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,050
It's off the streets. The streets. "Didn't ask, not curious" is what I said!

464
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,160
I am curious. Those flowers, where did you get them?

465
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,200
Perhaps... from that Tae Hee or what...

466
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,000
Tae Hee Oppa didn't come. If he did come, I would have just set him off.

467
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,990
I have someone who gives me flowers and things, too.

468
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,120
Don't just play around

469
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,100
and take some pictures.

470
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,910
If you press this...

471
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,770
I know.

472
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,710
Oh, I'm impressed.

473
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,190
I don't have any graduation photos.

474
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,810
I'm going to keep it forever!

475
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,940
Why must you talk like that when we're just taking one photo? How can anyone take a picture at this rate?

476
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,730
Don't move!

477
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,530
You have to count 1, 2, 3 before you take it.

478
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,290
You can't just take it like that.

479
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,460
Even so, you are pretty.

480
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,950
Our school is very nice, right?

481
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,690
It's nice.

482
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,410
There were a few things I didn't like, too...

483
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,040
Why did you take a picture like that?

484
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,510
A little bit closer.

485
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,690
But there were nice things, too.

486
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,700
It seems like nice things come later, just like you.

487
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,470
I came early, but I didn't know the classroom's number.

488
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,380
Not that.

489
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,030
Don't be sad that I came alone.

490
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:15,190
Deok Hwa went to work. And Reaper is not feeling so well now.

491
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,330
They all congratulate you.

492
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,250
Then... who are those two?

493
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,620
Those two  didn't come for your graduation, they came thinking they will meet someone here.

494
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:41,800
Amazing. Then us.... Mister, open the door.

495
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,740
It looks like you came to congratulate her on her graduation.

496
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,630
That's an excuse. I came to see someone else.

497
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:57,110
Thankfully, that someone is standing in front of me.

498
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:02,690
I came because I thought I'd be able to come to a decision when I saw your face, but seeing you,

499
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,050
it's just good.

500
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,590
What about the investigation you said before, is it done?

501
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:23,070
Why aren't you sharing the information? I came to listen to that.

502
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,180
Not yet...

503
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,910
Then, let's just say we will meet once the investigation is done
 and you would be returning the ring.

504
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,590
This, give it to my part-timer. I bought it to give it to her.

505
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,280
Why give this to me?

506
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,730
That's why I bought it.

507
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:55,080
I wanted to try to give flowers to someone at least once...

508
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,530
Who are you, Kim Woo Bin?

509
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:12,290
Although you might not believe me, but I don't know..

510
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,860
who I am.

511
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:23,510
I guess people in your household usually say unbelievable things and are unbelievable beings.

512
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,100
This relationship really has no answer.

513
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,080
I had hoped it wouldn't be like this but the conclusion keeps being tragic.

514
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,380
It's a present.

515
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,290
Since you graduated and became an adult, it's something that you might need.

516
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,220
I cannot use it yet.

517
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,110
Legally, I need my aunt's approval.

518
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,580
So we got the legal approval. This is now yours.

519
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26,090
Really? How?

520
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,650
Thank you.

521
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:35,490
It's not from me, but from your mother. I am just a messenger.

522
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,770
Still, thank you.

523
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:42,380
What do I do? I don't think I'll be able to use any of it.

524
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:47,120
Since my mom gave this to me, I don't think I'll be able to spend any of it.

525
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,520
Use it when you need it. I am sure this is what she wants.

526
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,960
Living in this world without a mother,

527
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,720
she saved it thinking about her nine-year-old daughter.

528
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,800
But, what happened to my aunt? Is she doing well?

529
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:10,240
It's so cold!

530
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,980
Oh, my face is so dry from using crappy lotion.

531
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,000
Why couldn't I remember Ji Eun Tak's name? Where can I go to find her?

532
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,720
We won't be able to find her. She must have graduated by now.

533
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,720
She must have gotten into college. We can probably locate her by looking through college directories.

534
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,840
She was good in school.

535
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,460
College! After eating rice with beans (in jail), your head is working properly now!

536
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,120
You're just a rice with beans type, aren't you?

537
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,850
You better eat it often. Let's go.

538
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,260
It's a worry. She couldn't have spent it all, right?

539
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,760
Hey, a wench who has spent money before is good at spending it. She could never spend that money because of her mom.

540
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,420
We just need to find her.

541
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,230
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

542
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,100
- Do you want to drink beer?
- I should sleep.

543
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,990
Looking at your expression, the result must not have been good. We even gave you space.

544
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,220
I am me, and you are you.

545
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,600
What are you talking about?

546
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,500
A name card arrived.

547
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,170
Chairman Yoo's?

548
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,660
No.

549
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,370
Miscellaneously Omitted.

550
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,970
Two weeks from now, it's death by falling. Even though you might not see it.

551
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,390
Thank you for letting me know.

552
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,860
Is that all? Aren't you going to get angry? Aren't you going to curse God?

553
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:47,320
This is going to keep happening. I can't get surprised every time it does.

554
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,640
That's true, too.

555
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,460
So you should get the sword pulled out and go back to nothingness. Be at peace.

556
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,520
If not, death will constantly haunt that child.

557
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,300
Will you be able to stop it every time?

558
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,410
Will I be able to stop it?

559
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,430
In the end,  there will be a time when you can't stop it. 

560
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,680
Then Eun Tak will lose her life and you will lose your chance of going back to nothingness.

561
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:19,820
You will need to live on for another thousand years or be in that hell of immortality. It's a foolish decision.

562
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:23,810
So get the sword pulled out and go into nothingness.

563
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,200
It might be sad but that is for the best.

564
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:35,130
I'm trying not to do what's best... but I'm a bit sad.

565
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:40,960
Is there something wrong?

566
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,190
What's this?

567
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,120
- A name card.

568
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,070
Whose? Yours?

569
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,130
No. Yours.

570
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,970
Mine?

571
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,660
Am I ... dying?

572
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:15,400
Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you. I hid something from you all of this time.

573
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,650
I said that I won't hide anything from you, but I still did it.

574
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:26,520
But... I cannot do it anymore so I will tell you everything.

575
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:33,660
If you don't remove my sword, you will die. That's been your destiny

576
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,750
since the moment you were born as the Goblin's Bride.

577
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:45,870
If you don't remove the sword, death won't stop looking for you.

578
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,630
Just like now.

579
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,830
So..

580
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:02,630
if I don't remove your sword, until I ultimately die,

581
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,660
death will come looking for me continuously?

582
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,690
All this time, those accidents...

583
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,380
Yeah.

584
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,180
When you were kidnapped,

585
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,630
You startled me!

586
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,320
... and when you collapsed at the ski resort,

587
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,980
there were a few more accidents you don't know about,

588
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,740
and also.... when I almost killed you.

589
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,740
God...

590
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,940
is so harsh

591
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,990
to both you and me.

592
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,190
This darn fate...

593
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:27,810
Ahjusshi, I'll just die.

594
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,240
You can continue to live so I will be reincarnated and meet you.

595
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:39,580
You must stay here.

596
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,400
I will come to find you. I promise.

597
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,520
Should I?

598
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,180
Ahjusshi, let's just pull the sword out.

599
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,680
If I die, then you would have to live forever. A bride probably won't appear.

600
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,690
Then, I should just pull out the sword. That would be better, right?

601
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,160
Should we?

602
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:23,120
Ahjusshi, let's just die together. That would be better. The same day, the same hour.

603
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,320
Without leaving someone behind, without hurting someone.

604
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,780
Ji Eun Tak, look at me.

605
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:46,430
You won't die. I will make it so that you won't die. I will prevent it.

606
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,800
I will prevent it all.

607
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,810
I'm sorry. For getting you entangled in this fate.

608
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:03,650
But we must pass this to go on.

609
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,710
I don't know what door will open,

610
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:14,500
but I will not let your hand go. I promise.

611
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,330
So believe in me.

612
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:22,000
I might be a bigger person than what you thought.

613
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:28,640
♬  Beautiful love  ♬

614
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,810
♬ If I am with you under the same sky ♬

615
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,010
Where are you going? I told you it's dangerous.

616
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,860
What do you mean where? To my part-time job.

617
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,020
Didn't you hear what I told you?

618
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,070
I heard and understood it well.

619
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:46,220
But, I can't live while just being locked here in the house.

620
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:50,040
If I live shaking in fear for a long time in this house,

621
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,230
that is not living.

622
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,370
♬ Beautiful day ♬

623
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,380
Even if I die tomorrow, I have to live today. Going to work,

624
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:04,790
preparing for college, walking on the sidewalk, and coming back home.

625
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,040
That's...

626
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,730
what life is. 
 ♬ It's a beautiful life. ♬

627
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:17,230
So protect me from dying with everything you have. And I will do whatever it takes not to die.

628
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,060
I believe in you.

629
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:26,170
It was so hard for my mom to give birth to me. I tried so hard to get into that college. I have so many reasons to live.

630
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,620
Among those, especially, you make me live.

631
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,290
♬ It's a sorrowful life. Sorrowful day ♬

632
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:36,110
Okay. Okay. If you feel like you are in danger, summon me.

633
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,500
Don't go to somewhere high.

634
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:44,970
Ahh... you said it was death by fall. Yes. Don't worry. I will be going.

635
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,400
♬ So that I won't have to live in your memory. ♬​

636
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,190
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬

637
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,760
No, the street light was blinking and I thought it was dangerous.

638
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:43,550
No, that man is so good looking. A good looking man is so dangerous.

639
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,840
No, those clothes are so excessively pretty.

640
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,110
Pretty clothes are a danger to my bank account.

641
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,490
No, because I missed you so much that I cannot breathe.

642
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,600
It's so dangerous.

643
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,550
Me, too.

644
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:27,820
♬   Heaven is in your kiss. Even the tears fall down   ♬

645
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,460
♬ You are the only one under this heaven ♬

646
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:37,570
♬ My smile is the only one under this heaven  ♬

647
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,530
Now, I get to see all sorts of things. Am I looking now at cherry blossoms in the middle of winter?

648
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,100
Hey, are you planning to die?

649
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,100
A height about 184 cm...

650
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:34,780
If you include his shoes with a height of 2 cm... is he about this tall?

651
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:49,450
♬ When I look at you  ♬

652
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:57,260
♬  I don't know why my tears keep falling ♬

653
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:04,490
♬  Were you coming to me and circling around? ♬

654
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:11,030
♬ This love which cannot be avoided.  ♬

655
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:19,190
♬   I love you, love you, love you   ♬

656
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,980
♬  I could feel that we were fated to be ♬

657
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:24,530
This is... your real identity?

658
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,480
♬   And I miss you   ♬

659
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,910
But... as always, I don't understand...

660
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,680
♬   My fated person ♬

661
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,410
Wh-What are you... exactly?

662
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,610
I'm going crazy.

663
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:51,780
How could something so unbelievable...

664
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,500
This is so unbelievable that...

665
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,020
everything also makes sense...

666
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,380
How you knew my name.

667
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,110
Why you didn't have a name.

668
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:15,260
Why all you do are all wrong answers.

669
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,920
♬ Why didn't you come to me till now? ♬

670
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,320
♬   I love you, love you   ♬

671
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,280
You did something to me last time, didn't you? Don't do that to me now. Whatever that may be.

672
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,300
I won't.

673
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,200
♬ I could feel we were fated.to be ♬

674
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,240
Just... I will just get caught.

675
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,660
♬   I miss you, miss you   ♬

676
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,540
What are you? What on earth are you?

677
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,170
♬ You are my fated person. ♬

678
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,560
I am...

679
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,370
♬ No matter how many times you’ll be born again ♬

680
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:53,120
a grim reaper.

681
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,840
♬ No matter where you'll hide, I'll find you. ♬

682
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,810
What did you say?

683
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,290
♬  We should never part again. ♬

684
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:07,490
I know it can't be... but I dreamed of a happy ending.

685
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,730
♬ Don't leave my side. ♬

686
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,980
But... as expected...

687
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,590
♬ Don't leave my side. ♬

688
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,110
...it's a tragedy.

689
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,750
Should we just...

690
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,280
break up?

691
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,830
I finished OT earlier and I just finished registering for classes. 

692
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,760
And now I'm touring the campus. 

693
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,050
Say "I miss you" with a sad emoji. Put a heart.

694
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:23,290
"I love you. ♥ ♥." Do it. So romantic!

695
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:28,840
I had my time too, my warm day of spring. But now I'm stuck roaming around this nether world with a deep grudge

696
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,020
and every day is a cold winter night for me.

697
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:37,230
It'd be so good if you could meet that punk for me once. It'd be so good if you could just ask him once what I'm curious about.

698
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,470
Curious about? What?

699
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,890
"Did you actually love me?" Something like that?

700
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,040
So romantic.

701
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,800
Fine. Let's put an end to that winter night.

702
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,790
Let's go take revenge. How do you want me to take care of that jerk?

703
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,690
- You're going to set fire? 
- Better to be safe than sorry.

704
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,260
- What is it? 
- I'm here

705
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:26,600
to tell you something on behalf of your deceased wife,

706
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,170
Miss Lee Jeong Hwa.

707
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,670
Do you have time?

708
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,320
How do you know my wife...

709
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,070
I'll just tell you what I'm here for simply.

710
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:51,470
Lee Jeong Hwa asked me to tell you something.

711
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:54,060
Yes, go ahead.

712
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,240
Have you been well?

713
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,910
You and Hee Jin look good together.

714
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:05,730
She's saying that.

715
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,660
- Who is? 
- Your wife is.

716
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,000
How do you know Hee Jin...

717
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,390
- You brought her home. 
- You brought her home.

718
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,730
- The day you guys had your 200th day anniversary. 
- The day you guys had your 200th day anniversary.

719
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,730
- You bought her a pretty bag, I saw. 
- You bought her a pretty bag, I saw.

720
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:31,330
- With money from my insurance. 
- With money from my insurance.

721
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,160
What, really? Jeez this is where I get pissed off.

722
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,690
So that's why that day, on the roof top...

723
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:40,920
So that's why that day, on the roof top...

724
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,580
- you pushed me? 
- you pushed--

725
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,850
[Ji Eun Tak, age 20]

726
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,880
What did you just ask me to do?

727
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,700
This kind of twist is not okay.

728
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,730
What are you?

729
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,270
You and Hee Jin conspired the crime together over the phone.

730
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,510
I recorded it all and hid it in the shoe cabinet by the front door.

731
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:19,880
I mean, if you hid the evidence of him and Hee Jin conspiring the crime,

732
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:24,390
you should be taking that to the police station to resolve this. This isn't the way.

733
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:28,190
You. How did you find out?

734
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,370
Where are you looking towards now when you're talking?

735
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:35,700
Yeah, this is supposed to be a sitcom. How come you're turning this into a thriller?

736
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:40,410
Your husband's so scary.

737
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,210
We'll all die if we just do this without a plan like this.

738
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,700
- I'm already dead. 
-...Unni!

739
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:49,980
Look how selfish you are. What about me then?

740
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,680
Are you... a crazy bitch?

741
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,300
Where the heck do you keep looking at and talking?

742
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,300
Your wife. Your wife that you killed.

743
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,750
So you want to die, too, then.

744
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:23,700
In any case, young bitches are so careless.

745
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,490
Just crawling up the rail like that.

746
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,680
Right?

747
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,830
"Death from a fall."

748
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,690
I really wasn't going to use the boyfriend card,

749
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:58,500
but I really worry how my boyfriend's going to reprimand you.

750
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,750
I'm sorry.

751
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,870
Go and get the human punishment.

752
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,880
If you take my punishment, you'll die.

753
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:56,140
I killed someone. I killed my wife.

754
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,810
I'm sorry. I just really wanted to say it.

755
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:14,920
That it's not fair. That it hurts.

756
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,950
"Save me. Help me." Those things I didn't get to say then.

757
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,430
I wanted to say them all.

758
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,170
- She said sorry. 
- Seriously, you're...

759
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,670
You almost died just now.

760
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:32,750
I know. I'm sorry.

761
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,490
You hurry and go somewhere nice. I need to be reprimanded, it seems.

762
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:44,800
Thank you for helping me.

763
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:48,240
Thank you for hearing me out.

764
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,720
Be well, Eun Tak.

765
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,880
You're still mad?

766
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,410
I'm sure you'd be mad. You should be mad.

767
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,010
I'm not mad. I was only worried.

768
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:26,250
But why do I feel like I'm getting scolded.

769
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,430
My heart feels like its stinging.

770
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:31,020
Not as bad as mine.

771
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,170
I don't know how many times I went to hell and came back within one hour.

772
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,750
Seriously.

773
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,820
We are so pitiful.

774
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,720
No.

775
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,750
Really.

776
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:46,150
Are we unfortunate then?

777
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,100
No.

778
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,720
Then...

779
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,070
Mister, about you scolding me...

780
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:56,090
is it done, then?

781
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,070
No.

782
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:04,440
When I'm a college student, I'm going to go on lots of meeting dates and wear only super short skirts.

783
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,790
No!

784
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,880
Your face is looking too thin these days.

785
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,610
Are you working out by any chance?

786
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,440
Are you having fun?

787
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,580
Because you look so depressed, I wanted to say something to make you laugh.

788
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:29,290
It's not funny. Why did you want to see me?

789
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:33,490
Well, you've got two Miscellaneously Omitted persons on your caseload, right?

790
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:37,250
But only one came up. You're supposed to turn in a letter of explanation.

791
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:41,100
Sunbaenim, you don't check your mail.

792
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,720
- I should know something in order to process it.
- What do you mean?

793
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:49,920
Has it been about 20 years? I made eye contact with some deceased person.

794
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,900
But that deceased had no information about him.

795
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,980
What kind of a deceased person?

796
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,040
It seems like he had been wandering in this life for so long.

797
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,830
He seemed to have no fear.  It was my first time seeing a deceased person who was not afraid of a grim reaper.

798
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:07,650
It was fascinating. Of course, I lost him.

799
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,240
I got nothing but blame when I reported it.

800
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,200
The other remaining document is for that deceased.

801
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:20,550
A new face. The one I mentioned before who's got a lot of info and has been living in the nether world for a long time.

802
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,090
Ahhh, that.

803
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,890
20 years ago

804
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,830
he even ran away from a grim reaper.

805
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,750
Really? I also had the same experience when I was nine...

806
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,480
Nice to meet you.

807
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,540
So you are that Goblin's bride.

808
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:06,700

Aren't you curious as to who you are?

816
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,900
Did he give me the answer?

817
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:42,480
Or was it a question?

818
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,080
Please forget me, too.

You must have been so lonely.

Please forgive me.

826
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:23,430
I asked if that person is King Yeo.

827
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,720
It is finally here.

828
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,730
I will do those now.
