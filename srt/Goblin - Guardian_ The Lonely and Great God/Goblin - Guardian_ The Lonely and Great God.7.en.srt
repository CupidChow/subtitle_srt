Goblin

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,850
Well, then I'm pulling it out.

Episode 7

6
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,340
But... why can't I grab it?

7
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,020
I can see it, so why can't I pull it out?

8
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,950
That... Did you put enough strength in your hands?

9
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,390
Wait a minute, let me try one more time.

10
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,290
What you definitely said earlier no matter what happens

11
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,540
it's not my fault can't be taken back.

12
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,150
Hey, so you're ...

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,420
- so you are not the Goblin bride-- 
 -I said you can't take it back!

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,500
So stand still, I said! I'm the one who is more flustered!

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,920
Hey! I  am standing still! How can I be more still? 
Hey, give me back that note so I can burn it.

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,610
Hold on!

17
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,370
I got it. I think this is that thing. I know it.

18
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,850
- What is it? 
 -The prince in a fairytale. The cursed prince. That.

19
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,290
What about that?

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,360
The kiss.

21
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,010
I was desperate, so please understand it.

22
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,050
Open your eyes.

23
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,140
This is me with my eyes open...

24
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,540
Hey, you! Just now... Are you crazy?

25
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,640
What do you mean, am I crazy?

26
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,630
To the person who tried everything to make Mister beautiful,

27
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,670
do you think I did it because I wanted to? It's a loss for me, too!

28
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,730
I'm sure you've done it many times all these years, but for me, it was...

29
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,420
- You're what? 
 - It was my first kiss!

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,140
It's not something that should have been used like that...

31
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,550
- Come here. Let me try it agai-- 
 - Hey, hey, hey... Say it from there. From over there.

32
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,430
Right now, there's no stopping me.

33
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,990
In this situation, if I can't make it happen, you'll ask for everything back that you've given me.

34
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,340
In this crisis, what is there that I couldn't do?

35
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,620
What's with you and this materialistic attitude? What are you going to do if it doesn't work?

36
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,510
If it doesn't work this time, then there's only one thing left.

37
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,730
- What is it? 
 - True love.

38
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,760
If necessary, I will have to do that, too! Instead of having this bag taken away from me,

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
I would rather love you, Mister!

40
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,500
I am sorry.

41
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,180
You even made the effort to make it snow...

42
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,150
- Woah. 
 - Woah?

43
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,610
What should I do now?

44
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,570
Do what?

45
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,440
- You're going to kick me out-- 
- I won't kick you out!

46
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,250
Really? You can't forget what you signed off on, either!

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,660
They say that real men keep their word!

48
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,590
You can't be petty or go back on it!

49
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,930
So, you're saying that our Uncle won't be coming back?

50
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,490
So what you're saying is that our Uncle has...

51
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,200
left this world?

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
[Certificate of Title]

53
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,400
While living as an immortal, at last, he reached mortality.

54
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,430
Do not miss him for too long. Death is just

55
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,670
another world outside the door. One day you, too, will open that door--

56
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,500
Aigoo, Uncle!

57
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,350
Don't go, Uncle! I don't need a card.

58
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,970
I don't need this kind of card. Please come back, Uncle.

59
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,270
What is this?

60
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,210
Why is he coming through that door?

61
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,730
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

62
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,930
Deok Hwa...

63
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,460
Uncle! Did you come back? Are you back again?

64
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,460
I love you, Uncle.

65
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,230
There, there. So that's why I'm saying this, but can you give me that card back?

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,930
You heard it. Why behave as though you didn't hear it?

67
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,660
Uncle,

68
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,380
it's just a new world behind the door. Since you already set out for that path,

69
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,700
just go straight on your way, Uncle.

70
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,930
Deok Hwa seems to be very worried about his uncle.

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,800
That's right, don't worry about us.

72
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,300
Can you give me back the deed?

73
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,800
Exactly, how did you handle your task?

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,560
Ji Eun Tak.

75
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,190
- Yes? 
-  Perfume, $5,000, purse... Can you give them back before you go up?

76
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,160
Uncle, did you give that girl that much?

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,740
I don't want to. I can't. You said you wouldn't kick me out.

78
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,020
I asked you to return the perfume, $5,000, and the purse.

79
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,350
I didn't say that I was kicking you out.

80
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,660
Mister...

81
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
I love you...

82
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,140
I said I love you...

83
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,270
I love you, too.

84
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,760
- Mister.
- Shut up!

85
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,890
- I love...
- You knave!

86
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,000
By chance, did you burn that scroll?

87
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,480
Of course, I burned it.

88
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,900
Ah, this fellow, you go too far with your joke!

89
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,160
Didn't that scare you? That's punishment for saying your good-byes so diligently.

90
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,460
I will accept my punishment.

91
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,160
The scroll I will return to you safe and sound in the morning,

92
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,100
so please do not worry too much.

93
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,190
Thank you and I am sorry.

94
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,900
Then, My Lord, I ask of you.

95
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,930
How about trying to live instead of trying to die?

96
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,250
Wouldn't it be nice if because of you, someone in this world

97
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,230
who lived a righteous life of good

98
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,100
gets to experience mysteriously beautiful luck and a miracle

99
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,420
for once in their life?

100
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,300
The man who does not get old...

101
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,660
You, at 29 years of age,

102
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,780
are still as bright as ever.

103
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,020
 But at your side... I am not there.

104
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,110
 But... why can't I grab it?

105
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,710
I can see it, so why can't I pull it out?

106
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,020
Has the future changed or has Ji Eun Tak changed?

107
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,610
In any case...

108
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,140
it's nice to be back.

109
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,680
Shamelessly...

110
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,100
Miscellaneously omitted.

111
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,420
Tell me in detail, what happened?

112
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,050
Ah...

113
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,950
At the start it was fairly good.

114
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,590
In the moonlight, the expanse of the buckwheat flower field and the early first snowfall....

115
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,460
Anyway, so I grabbed the sword, but the thing is...

116
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,520
I could only see it but couldn't get a hold of it.

117
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,040
He came back alive somehow. I thought one of the two wouldn't be back.

118
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,630
I know. I thought he would leave me behind in that buckwheat field,

119
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,770
but he let me come back.

120
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,170
Miscellaneously omitted doesn't know right now

121
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,010
 what will happen when the sword is pulled out.

122
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:58,680
 Should I tell her? Then the Goblin might die out of anger.

123
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,580
 Then... this house would be mine. 

124
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,880
What are you thinking about?

125
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,690
When you look at me like that,

126
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,780
- it scares me a little.
 - You can see the sword,

127
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,560
so why is it that you can't get a hold of it?

128
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,140
Those kinds of affable thoughts.

129
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,030
Right? Me, too. Why do you think that is?

130
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,250
Like what the Goblin said, am I really not the Goblin's bride?

131
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,020
Will the real bride who can grab the sword show up?

132
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,910
Do you think she is... beautiful?

133
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,250
There's no order to pulling it out.

134
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,790
That's what I mean.

135
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,350
You don't think he will mistreat me, right? Since there's some affection from having lived together?

136
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,380
Because we have one additional person in our household, it's difficult to keep up with the cost of living.

137
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,210
We're out of all the meat. Do I have to start keeping a ledger?

138
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,620
Feeling so down like this... I wonder how I'm going to get the dishwashing done, too.

139
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,210
I-I will do it!

140
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,080
I really want to do the dishes!

141
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,500
You will?

142
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,680
But then again, you're at that age where you really want to do the dishes.

143
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,670
There is so much laundry to do!

144
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,230
I can't go to the dry cleaner's all the time with my limited budget.

145
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,250
Should I just throw away all the clothes then... ?

146
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,330
Me! As soon as I'm done with the dishes,

147
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,970
- I can also do the laundry! 
 - Would you?

148
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,480
If that's really what you'd like to do, please wash the clothes manually.

149
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,650
Being able to study well requires the house to be clean.

150
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,150
Anyway, when should I clean the rooms?

151
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,680
Having a high school senior at home makes me worry about so many things.

152
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,020
I think you did that on purpose just now?

153
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,010
No, I didn't.

154
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,940
You can obviously see that I've been splattered with water all over.

155
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,180
It'll take until evening for these to dry.

156
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm pretty sure you're doing that intentionally.

157
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,250
Why? Do you not want to do laundry? Just tell me if you have any complaints.

158
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,990
Oh, complaints? Thanks for bringing that up.

159
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,300
You're probably thinking right now that I'm not your bride,

160
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,550
but let's not rush to conclusions.

161
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,410
You'll regret a lot later if you keep being mean to me like this.

162
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,820
Did you say, "I'm indeed your bride, so how can I see it, but can't pull it out?"

163
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,570
You said all the time spent with me was dazzling.

164
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,610
Because the day was good and because the day was bad...

165
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,570
- And also because the day was just right. 
 - Yeah.

166
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,010
- Today as well. 
 - See?

167
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,480
What?

168
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,440
Even now, everything is dazzling.

169
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,570
But then why...

170
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,940
- are you being so mean to me?
- Because that's a different matter...

171
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,570
How is that a different matter if I'm bringing dazzle into your life?

172
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,440
So, let's not be like this

173
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
and find a different value.

174
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,050
If you're not happy with calling me your bride,

175
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,250
- I can be your girlfriend since you're my boyfriend. 
 - I don't want to.

176
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,610
- Then let's just be acquaintances? 
 - I don't like that, either.

177
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,460
Then I'll just be a tenant?

178
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,560
Then pay me your rent from today. It's $500 per month, and you need to pay  separately for water and electricity.

179
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,540
He asked you for money?

180
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,810
Yes! We're enemies from today.

181
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,990
We'll eventually have to confront each other.

182
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,120
All this conflict is rising from my not being able to grab the sword...

183
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,940
Maybe you need something stronger than the sign on your back?

184
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,570
For example, real love? Something like that?

185
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,800
I already tried that.

186
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,210
Tried what?

187
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,530
A kiss.

188
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,060
You surprised me!

189
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,520
Do you talk about those kinds of things like that... ?

190
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,950
How can you talk about that kiss to anyone?

191
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,420
Were you that kind of person?

192
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,900
I didn't say it. It was you who said it just now.

193
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,820
- You weren't going to say it? 
 - No, I wasn't!

194
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,230
You guys... kissed?

195
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,340
Even if I mention it, I'd be talking about myself. Why do you make such a big deal out of it?

196
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,580
Technically, this is my kiss.

197
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,060
Hey, how can a kiss be either yours or mine?  Even if we could own a kiss, half of it would be mine!

198
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,420
Fine, you can take your half, then.

199
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,850
- No, I don't want to, I don't need it. 
 - Okay, sure, I'll own everything then.

200
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,880
Okay, then! You're so greedy!

201
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,150
To someone

202
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,040
who can't even call her because he doesn't have a business card,

203
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,750
they are being so explicit about their relationship.

204
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,410
What's the matter?

205
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,090
Okay! You came back alive.

206
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,480
But don't we have to make the miscellaneously omitted leave?

207
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,130
- What? 
 - Why?  You don't want to?

208
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm saying that we should kick her out so that the two of us can live happily together just as we have been doing so far.

209
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,570
Who did you live with until now then?

210
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,740
She doesn't seem to be the bride, so I think we should kick her out!

211
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,520
She already knows about our identity. Don't you think she'll spread some word about it if she goes out?

212
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,930
She doesn't seem to be someone who'd do that if you gave her $5,000.

213
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,150
What did you learn from watching TV shows? Once you start giving money, you're basically starting a vicious cycle.

214
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,240
- Do you want to keep being blackmailed?  
 - It's not that you want her to stay?

215
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,130
Hey, I want to kick her out so desperately right now!

216
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,180
- What? 
 - You're happy that the miscellaneously omitted couldn't grab the sword, aren't you?

217
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,280
Be honest. You're happy because you didn't have to die and because you can keep seeing her, right?

218
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,820
Why? Why would I be happy? Am I crazy? I waited 900 years for this! Does that make sense?

219
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,990
Okay, then! I'll do the job of taking her away for the sake of our friendship.

220
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,530
You would also be finding her annoying, right? She kissed you without even asking for your permission.

221
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,070
Why are you bringing up friendship? There doesn't exist any friendship between us!

222
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,700
You wanting me dead! Is that friendship?

223
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,040
Hey! You're happy right now. Because you didn't die.

224
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,610
No! It's just that I have a promise to keep.

225
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,600
I already signed the contract, so I can't go back on my word.

226
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,690
As a man, I'm just trying to keep my promise!

227
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,670
I guess you weren't a man when you gave me the house deed.

228
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,890
Hey, when a goblin is being angry... Hey, listen!

229
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,750
Reaper! Reaper? Reaper.

230
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,570
You will answer my summons on the day of the first snow every year.

231
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,250
It's because I'm going to be waiting.

232
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,930
Why are you studying out here when you have your own room? Are you protesting?

233
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm just being close to where the snacks are.

234
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,830
Ever since you don't have to be nice to me anymore,

235
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,790
you haven't been giving snacks to me. That's so mean of you.

236
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,320
The budget has been getting tighter these days,

237
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,800
so it's lavish to spend money on snacks for a high school senior.

238
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,910
Please don't provoke me. I'm at a stage of life where I'm feeling annoyed all the time,

239
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,620
- because the national college entrance exam date is approaching! 
 - Are you being angry at me right now!

240
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,620
What kind of guardian angel are you, treating me like this right before the entrance exam?

241
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,480
- Ah! 
 - Why? What?

242
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,960
Do you know the answers to the entrance exam, by any chance?

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,320
Yeah, but when's the exam?

244
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,040
You know the answers when you don't even know the date?

245
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,900
- Yes, do you want me to tell you the answers? 
 - Yes!

246
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,260
- First, solve all those. 
 - Okay!

247
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,090
FYI, the entrance exam is next Thursday.

248
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,550
Hey, but ...

249
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,870
- last time, that first— 
 - Oh, right!

250
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,700
I was going to bring that up first.

251
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,120
Well, don't feel sorry for me.

252
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,470
It was, of course, my first kiss, but...

253
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,660
Hey, I-I was just going to...

254
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,690
I was just going to talk about the first snow.

255
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,100
Ahh, the first snow?

256
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,740
Don't mention it!

257
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,830
Don't talk about anything that involves the letters "ch". 
(the first letters of the Korean words "first kiss" and "first snow")

258
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,150
- Hey, you got that first question wrong. 
 - Don't do that. ("first question" also starts with "ch")

259
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,120
- Aren't you hungry? 
 -  Don't do that! ("hungry" also contains "ch")

260
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,130
Why do we hear so much traffic noise when you are trying to study? 
("traffic noise" also starts "ch")

261
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,520
Is the bed comfortable enough? 
("bed" starts with  "ch")

262
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,420
I put a lot of meat in it so that you would feel satisfied and full.

263
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,760
- Do you think it is food that I really want right now? 
 - Will you be able to memorize it, though?

264
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,900
I'll call out the answers in order, so listen well.

265
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,680
- First, I'll start with the language section. 
 - I hate you!

266
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,320
Just go back home! I'm fighting the urge to listen to your answers.

267
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,260
There is a car coming.

268
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,140
Absolute power requires politeness.

269
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,860
If you still want the answers...

270
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,300
- I'm fine, I'll be able to answer all the questions anyway. 
 -  Wow...

271
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,910
It would only seem natural if I pat your shoulder as well, right?

272
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,890
I will look at your watch very naturally.

273
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,710
Did you stop the time by any chance?

274
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,170
No.

275
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,680
Oh no, oh no! I'm screwed.

276
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,650
It's already been thirty minutes!

277
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,990
Don't worry. Did you forget that your boyfriend was a goblin?

278
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,070
You said you didn't like being called my boyfriend.

279
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:09,230
It was a lie. Follow me.

I'm back!

290
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,190
I'm feeling tired.

291
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,990
I used my brain too much today, so I'm so ti...

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,240
How was your exam?

293
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,260
I came up with the idea, this guy paid, and this other guy bought it.

294
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,750
Wow... it's a cake!

295
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,330
Why are you crying? Did you flunk your exam?

296
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,600
It's not that. It's because I'm so happy.

297
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,380
I'm totally happy today, so I should make a wish.

Why are you standing there like that?

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,990
Really? Wait a minute. I'm going to put my book bag in my room. Just give me ten seconds.

307
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,170
You two go, too. To your room, to your house.

308
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,920
- Why? I want to watch a movie with some popcorn--
 - You can't.

309
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,210
Why did he call me over if it was going to be like this?

310
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,560
Was the test just an excuse or something?

311
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,440
If he made the national exam just so they could watch a movie together, then let's give him that.

312
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,410
- You. Let's have a talk.
 - Pardon?

313
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,770
Me... Why... ?

314
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,930
I have something I'm curious about.

315
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,830
- I'm surely not as curious as you are.
 - You.

316
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,790
- Where did you get your business card? 
 - Pardon?

317
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,460
Business card. Rectangular in form and usually white

318
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,830
and has four sharp corners--

319
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,010
The company gave me mine because I'm a 3rd generation chaebol, of course. But why do you ask?

320
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,740
- I want to possess one. 
 - Pardon?

321
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,140
Also, there's another thing I'm curious about.

322
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,280
While t-t-this close?

323
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,960
If that person really is Yoo Deok Hwa of Cheon Woo Group, then he's my lord. 

324
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,470
My landlord.

325
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,740
She said you're some kind of a lord. A landlord.

326
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,200
Ah... I just own a building. But why do you ask?

327
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,720
 ♫ When I look at you ♫ 

328
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:07,480
♫  I don’t know why my tears keep falling ♫

329
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,800
♫ Were you coming back to me? ♫

330
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,820
♫  This love that can't be avoided♫

331
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:29,580
♫  I love you, love you, love you.♫

332
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:37,060
♫  I could feel that we are fated to be ♫

333
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:44,650
♫ And I miss you, miss you ♫

334
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,780
♫ You are my fated person ♫

335
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,460
Ah, I feel good.

336
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,790
Hey. Huh?

337
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,860
Where are you going? Did you close up the shop?

338
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,940
Ah... I was just on my way there.

339
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,790
Yes, we're closed. My boyfriend is waiting, so come next time.

340
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,060
Come on... You have to open the door.

341
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,900
How about just one more drink, huh?

342
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,690
What? Wait....

343
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,530
Did you... fly just now?

344
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,500
Swiftly... Up and over... What are you, a bird?

345
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,140
What's the matter with me? Why am I here?

346
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,340
That's what I want to know! This is driving me nuts!

347
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,420
Why do I keep seeing things like this these days? Get home safely.

348
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,410
You know how to do things like this, too?

349
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,620
Do you think there's anything I can't do?

350
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,410
What? What would you like? Rabbit or raccoon, just tell me.

351
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,260
The lighter. Mister, I want that lighter.

352
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,550
What? I didn't hear you.

353
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,070
I didn't say anything.

354
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,960
It was so close this time, right?

355
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,010
Let's just go. Who cares if you can make gold appear when you can't make the lighter come out!

356
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,970
Grab it! Grab it!

357
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,550
It's not grabbing. And it's almost time for the movies.

358
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,350
Hey, hold on. I'm about to get it!

359
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,340
Don't scream and put me in an awkward situation. Just tell me if you're scared.

360
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,690
You know,  I've lived for 19 years in a horror movie.

361
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,930
Don't you think I should be able to deal with at least this much?

362
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,570
Oh, it's starting.

363
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,410
I want to get out of here! I want to leave!

364
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,630
Why are you like this?

365
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

366
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:08,810
Look! First snowfall came in the cinema.

367
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,050
I-I'm sorry.

368
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,970
I didn't get to see anything because of you!

369
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,670
I don't even remember what the movie was about!

370
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,130
Weren't the zombies scary? Ah, the future of the Korean film industry looks promising.

371
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,670
Place your order. You're probably starving from crying and screaming.

372
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,490
I'm not hungry since I ate the popcorn, so don't mind me.

373
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,470
Okay, then. I won't. I'll just take one of those. Make it large.

374
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,290
Okay.

375
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,250
For question number 7 in the math section, I used substitution to solve the equation, and...

376
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,970
I put cabbages on top of the x-axis...

377
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,230
not... but right there

378
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,700
I nearly fell into the trap but... Is it good?

379
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,270
Yeah.

380
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,720
Their large sandwiches are really large here.

381
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,830
If you overeat, it's not good for your health.

382
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,580
Didn't you drink a large juice last time?

383
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,980
How many cows did you eat before that? How is your health?

384
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,310
It's really tasty. You should have some, too.

385
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,080
Do you know how much this is? How can we get two? You know that.

386
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,750
Exactly how long are you going to be mean to me?

387
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,860
You took everything away that you gave me. That bag was really pretty.

388
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,620
I've never seen $5,000 before. You shouldn't have given it to me in the first place.

389
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,120
I'll do that next time.

390
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,510
It was really strange for me, too.

391
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:38,030
As if you weren't planning to be around anymore.

392
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,120
You told me to use them when I got older...

393
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,830
You gave Deok Hwa Oppa a card and gave the house to the Grim Reaper.

394
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,690
You gave them only what they wanted... Like parting gifts...

395
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,110
It's true, right? Parting gifts?

396
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,740
You were planning to leave once I pulled the sword out, right?

397
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,910
It's true...

398
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,620
But why?

399
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,680
I thought I told you once. When the bride appears, I have to prepare to go even farther away.

400
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,140
To where? Europe? Canada?

401
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,410
Even now? Do you still want to leave?

402
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,570
No, I don't want to leave.

403
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,680
But if the bride really does appear,

404
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,270
that choice probably won't be mine to make.

405
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,580
Ah... that's true...

406
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,810
You're going to go with her? With the real bride?

407
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,910
Will you let me go?

408
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:01,670
No. I'm not going to let you go, so just go and leave me behind.

409
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,000
When the real bride appears... No,

410
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,290
I will leave before then.

411
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,480
So just leave when I'm not around; without me knowing.

412
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,050
- Did Uncle buy you something good to eat? 
 - No.

413
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,330
Why? Are you still Kongji (Cinderella-like character) in that household?

414
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,530
Yes, the Goblin is the wicked stepmother.

415
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,620
How many wicked stepmothers are there in my life?

416
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,380
Isn't it strange? My Uncle is the type of person whose 1,000-year-old fury dissipates by just looking at a girl group.

417
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,750
And?

418
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,800
Ever since he met you, he's just been continuously furious.

419
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,490
You're so not his type, that's what.

420
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,620
Girl group?

421
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,230
Elders said that when you go to college, you naturally become slimmer and prettier.

422
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,690
That old man, just wait till I get into college!

423
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,370
2017 Department of Journalism and Visual Media Undergraduate Extemporaneous Essay

424
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,950
Wow! College oppas!

425
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,290
Are you alright?

426
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,600
Are you Oppa Tae Hee?

427
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,490
Are you Ji Eun Tak?

428
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,120
Wow, it's been such a long time! I almost didn't recognize you.

429
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,710
I know. I changed a lot, right? I've been through a lot since then.

430
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,730
It's because you became prettier.

431
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
You grew taller as well.

432
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,660
Do you also go to this school? I took my writing exam here today.

433
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,280
CEO, over here.

434
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,750
Is it that guy... ? Is it he she was referring to as CEO?

435
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,540
Get up and eat something.

436
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,380
He messed with her hair...

437
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,420
I almost broke his wrist.

438
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,200
Who?

439
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,850
She moved her body in a shy way.

440
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,270
So I thought she was a twisted bread stick.

441
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,280
So who are you talking about?

442
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,840
I should just have let him play the piano...

443
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,630
Then they wouldn't have ended up meeting each other...

444
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,540
Who met whom?

445
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,890
I'm back!

446
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,300
No!

447
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:22,040
My spring! Who's that stupid man? He's so annoying...

448
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,660
Yay, I did it!

449
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:37,590
Tae Hee really became a real baseball player. How cool.

450
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,750
Are you going to have some ice cream?

451
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,080
No, I'm going to eat it all of it myself. I paid for it.

452
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,620
I didn't say anything, though.

453
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,900
Because it rained, I craved ice cream. Because of the rain.

454
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,470
I told you I didn't say anything.

455
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,980
That's what I mean. Why are you holding that ice cream without having said anything?

456
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,760
Put that back down while I'm talking nicely to you.

457
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,620
About this Bluetooth speaker...

458
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,430
Get your hands off of it!

459
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:31,190
Do you even know how to use this? You can even take a picture using it.

460
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,260
I'm going to take a picture of myself eating this ice cream with that, so don't touch it.

461
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,420
What? Why?

462
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,930
You're being so stingy with food. Why did it rain?

463
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,570
What about your feelings? Why? Are you sad?

464
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,730
Are you asking that because you really don't know why?

465
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:50,970
What?  Because I can't grab that sword? Is that my fault?

466
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,880
I tried my best. Can that sword even be pulled out in the first place?

467
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,000
The kiss didn't work. We both said "I love you" and it didn't work. What else can be done?

468
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,160
You weren't being sincere. It was a very offhand "I love you!"

469
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,690
Then were you sincere? Your  "I love you" had a very clear ulterior motive.

470
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,020
You have a very peculiar personality.

471
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,210
Do you think you have a nice personality?

472
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,390
I'm young!

473
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,830
So what? You'll get older, but I won't. I will stay young and be beautiful.

474
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,690
You are not young, though.

475
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,770
Moreover, I met my first love, so I can't waste my time perceiving your beauty.

476
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,020
What? What love?

477
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,260
Are you good at baseball? My Tae Hee is really good at it.

478
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Did you see me playing baseball? You'd be surprised if you did, you little thing.

479
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,670
Oh... So now I'm degraded from a tenant to a thing? Okay, this thing will make itself disappear now.

480
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,800
Have fun taking pictures of your life with this.

481
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,100
You... You, don't ask me for pictures!

482
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,870
This little thing... !

483
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,360
Who's Tae Hee? Come out here!

484
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,980
Hey, Choi Tae Hee! Someone's looking for you!

485
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm Choi Tae Hee. Who are you?

486
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,390
You... You were going to look like this?

487
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,440
- Pardon me?
- You're the most good-looking here!

488
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,930
That's right.

489
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,800
You've seen me before, right?

490
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,920
I'm seeing you right now, right now!

491
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,350
No, look at me. You've really never seen me before? When I was this little?

492
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,210
You can't even hit that?

493
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,440
Turn your waist like this.

494
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,780
I'm fine, just mind your own business.

495
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,330
I'm saying this because I'm better than you! First of all, your grip is wrong.

496
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:03,450
Hey, Mr. Little Man who's 155 cm tall!  I've been living as an upright general...

497
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,820
Forget it.  You'd be surprised if you knew who I was, so just mind your own business.

498
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,630
Then, do you want to make a bet?

499
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:14,630
This is insane. Who do you think I am? You'll regret it.

500
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,330
You're the one who should be worried about regretting. Let's hit ten balls and the loser has to listen to the winner's wish!

501
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,140
Deal!

502
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,870
This is going well!

503
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,710
There's a thief!

504
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,590
I don't know when the thief came in but he only took the piano.

505
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,590
He really got rid of it.

506
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,530
He took away that big thing, but not a single neighbor witnessed it happening.

507
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,290
This is so weird, so weird.

508
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,910
I won the bet, so I asked you to get rid of my piano.

509
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,780
My mom insisted on my playing the piano despite my lack of aptitude for it,

510
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:02,680
and I wanted to become a baseball player.

511
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,950
But the piano really disappeared.

512
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,340
So what?

513
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,290
That man who was there at that time, wasn't that you?

514
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:10,930
No!

515
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:17,310
I think so, too.  But if you're indeed that person, you haven't gotten any older at all...

516
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,170
So that kid recognized me.

517
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,570
So what?

518
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:36,490
Is that the only thing you can say? Do you think I'm helping you with these vulgar things just to get such a terse response?

519
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,370
If you don't erase his memory, there will be weird rumors about a man who doesn't get old.

520
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:42,880
So I'll eventually have to leave this place! You said you wanted to live happily with me!

521
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,950
You said we never lived happily together, though.

522
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,120
You are not supposed to live like this. You should help other people out at times of difficulty.

523
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,390
Why should I help a goblin who doesn't even have the power to erase memories?

524
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,830
Okay, cool. Let's see what'll happen.

525
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,840
Sure, sure.

526
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,900
- Hey! 
 -  What?

527
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,090
Weren't you going to cook it before eating it, anyway?

528
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,860
Good. This is perfect!

529
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,340
Why are you in this room?

530
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:34,870
I-I was going to clean the room.

531
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,130
I saw the vacuum outside the room.

532
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,650
Give me the thing you're sitting on.

533
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,590
There's one more.

534
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,480
I remember signing only once...

535
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,390
Really? Then why are there two pieces of paper? Oh, my!

536
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,880
Are you aware that this is forgery, trespassing, theft, and...

537
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,860
You're so petty! I heard your 1000-year-old-fury dissipates when you see girl groups.

538
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,900
I'm sorry that I didn't know you were that kind of person.

539
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,610
This is mine, so give this back to me.

540
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,250
I came here to get this back.  You have no idea.

541
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,950
I told you you could read it, not to keep it forever.

542
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,730
Wow, look at her.

543
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,950
See, see. I can't tell which one's the original copy and which one's the forged one.

544
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:49,290
I shouldn't compliment her on her skills at forgery in this situation. I wonder what she'll become in the future...

545
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:03,740
He probably used this book very roughly since it's not his. He frustrates me so much. If I find something...

546
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,530
Look at this here! He wrote in my book!

547
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,680
[It was first love]

548
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,650
Wow... first love?

549
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:24,260
Right, right. He would have had a first love. He's done a lot of things despite merely being a broomstick.

550
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:27,930
It was a first kiss for me, though.

551
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,070
His handwriting is sooo ugly.

552
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,680
[Tae Hee]

553
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,120
Hi, Tae Hee!

554
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,470
It's okay...

555
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,900
What am I supposed to do?

556
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,930
I got a call.

557
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:30,950
[Not Sun Hee but Sunny]

558
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,600
So what?

559
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,170
Answer the call for me. If I avoid her anymore, she might kill me.

560
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,220
I still don't have a business card so I can't take the call.

561
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,280
I've got nothing to say if I answer it. Just once!

562
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,240
Why don't you have anything to say? Don't you know my voice? This isn't a forgettable voice.

563
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,360
What? You said not to help each other. You, Grim Reaper, who can't see an inch before your eyes!

564
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,420
Forget it. But where did miscellaneously omitted go?

565
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,000
She can't help you, either.

566
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,800
She's at the ice cream shop down below doing the hee-hee-ha-ha sesame roasting. (Having a sweet time)

567
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,320
Roasting sesames? Why would she do that outside and not at home?

568
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,980
Get lost. I don't even want to explain.

569
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,070
When I think about it, it's so amazing.

570
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,090
To meet you there then like that.

571
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,640
Me, too.

572
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,350
How's life been for you, Oppa?

573
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:39,410
Let's see. I guess thinking about you every now and then?

574
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,790
You! Seriously...

575
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,800
Miscellaneously omitted,

576
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,370
take a call for me.

577
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:54,190
Are you nuts? How can you follow me  here?

578
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,260
Who is this?

579
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,260
Your father?

580
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:11,440
Your words are harsh. One who speaks harsh, what's your name?

581
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,820
Oppa! Don't tell him your name. Not the eyes either. Quickly look down.

582
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,390
I can't take the call right now so if you don't take the call for me,

583
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,650
I will ask him his name and write it down nicely.

584
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,850
Resolve it.

585
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,010
I got it.

586
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,030
Just a moment.

587
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,010
One who speaks harshly, have a seat.

588
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,220
So, you used to play the piano but you play baseball now?

589
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,190
How do you know that?

590
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:55,160
But she'll just misunderstand more if a woman answers it. Whatever.

591
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,560
Hello?

592
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:06,110
Isn't this Mr. Kim Woo Bin's cellphone?

593
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:14,130
It is. Section Chief Kim Woo Bin is currently absent from his seat.

594
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,980
He's a Section Chief?

595
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,780
He's a Director.

596
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,950
What kind of a company is it, that he gets promoted within a second?

597
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,920
Whatever. I know he's next to you. 
So the cafe we had our meeting in before, tomorrow, at 1 p.m.

598
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:34,510
Tell him to come as a section chief or a director but if he's late, I'll kill him.

599
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,930
[Not Sun Hee but Sunny]

600
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,790
How did it go? What did she say?

601
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,140
She wants to meet face-to-face. Tomorrow at 1 p.m. at the cafe you met in before.

602
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,250
But the one who just called, her voice sounded familiar. Is she--

603
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,280
Wait. My question first.

604
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,640
What's your question?

605
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,900
Phone number, name, then your age, blood type, unmarried or married, an approximate asset... 

606
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,610
dating experience yes-or-no, your ideal type, etc. You don't know what she might ask, so prepare for all those.

607
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,200
Aquarius... no.

608
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,980
Sagittarius...

609
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:31,520
Age: 34. Birthday, 5th day of November on the lunar calendar, Sagittarius, type AB, unmarried.

610
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,960
Full lease on the house, will get a car if needed. Clean past. Business card, not yet.

611
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,950
I missed you.

612
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,010
What... I...  Me, too.

613
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,840
Funny  man. Seriously.

614
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,200
Are you happy? After avoiding my calls like that?

615
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:01,380
Because I... thought you wouldn't like someone who didn't have a business card.

616
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:05,060
Then you could just answer my call and tell me you didn't have a business card.

617
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,420
Or just text me.

618
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:10,430
I will in the future.

619
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,210
Ms. Sunny, by any chance, your business card...

620
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,180
Why are you asking about my business card?

621
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,030
I was curious as to what kind of person you are.

622
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,930
My face is my business card. It says so right here. A Pretty Person.

623
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,740
You always want to verify ♬

624
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,630
♬ Even if I tell you the same thing ♬

625
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:32,610
I see... It's true.

626
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,410
I really wish... I could take your business card.

627
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,540
♬ My lips are drying up ♬

628
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,510
♬ I'm getting a cold sweat again ♬

629
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:44,960
See that? We have so much fun when we see each other. Get to know each other more and become closer!

630
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,570
♬ What you want to hear ♬

631
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,410
♬ The word that you want to hear ♬

632
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,460
♬ The word that tests me ♬

633
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,270
Woo Bin, what do you like?

634
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:54,270
Sunny.

635
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,900
♬ You're so beautiful ♬

636
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,300
You're driving me crazy...

637
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,800
Not that, what about your hobbies and things?

638
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,600
Sunny.

639
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,270
I got it, but--

640
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:10,930
Your unpredictable actions

641
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:14,620
draw me in unconditionally as much as a drama.

642
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:21,840
Your unpredictable actions require a lot of imagination, and my awkward actions,

643
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,480
each and everyone, are wrong.

644
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,620
My new hobby, that is Sunny, seems like God's plan

645
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,270
but then it also seems like God's mistake as well.

646
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,870
♬ Did you get a new hair do? ♬

647
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,400
♬ Did you change your nail color? ♬

648
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,980
How does he speak so well? Do you have a religion, by any chance?

649
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,450
♬ Words you'd like to hear ♬

650
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:47,690
So there's something... else I need again.

651
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,450
I will contact you when it's ready...

652
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:53,900
No! It's okay if you don't have one. Sit right there before I kill you!

653
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:57,320
♬ no, a thousand times ♬

654
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,500
♬ The correct answer is only one. ♬

655
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,200
This man, really... What is he...?

656
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,180
I'm 34, born November 5th--

657
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,490
No, no! You don't have to tell me. Just keep staying seated.

658
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,370
I'll pretend I'm looking at a picture.

659
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,780
♬ and tomorrow, if you ask, ♬

660
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,550
♬ ♬ In the whole world you're the most ♬ ♬

661
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,920
♬  beautiful. ♬

662
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,290
What do you like?

663
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:31,170
I like vegetables. Then I will--

664
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,720
Huh? What?

665
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,630
I have to go that way.

666
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,520
Then what about me? Weren't we going somewhere to eat?

667
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,540
Without buying me dinner?

668
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,310
But you ate a whole hot dog.

669
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,530
Overeating is the start of all illnesses.

670
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:53,180
The person who's causing me the most illness is right here. Never mind that. Where are you going?

671
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,240
I'm going to a company dinner. If I don't go, there's a fine.

672
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,830
What kind of man...

673
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,880
Really, each and every awkward action of yours is wrong.

674
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,050
They're all wrong.

675
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:10,030
The problem is too difficult.

676
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,200
Let's all eat and die! Cheers!

677
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,740
Cheers!

678
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,560
Just have a little.

679
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,080
Watch where you're going! Watch it!

680
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,340
This thing! Does he want to die?

681
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,820
Do you think he knows what he just did?

682
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,720
Within a month, he will definitely suffer the wrath of the earth gods. What should we do, Senior?

683
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,720
That's his fate. Never mind. I have to use the bathroom.

684
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,470
Me, too.

685
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,750
Hey, cheers!

686
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,150
Manager is here. Let's wrap it up.

687
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,730
Pay the bill.

688
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,720
You ate so much.

689
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,410
Huh?

690
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,320
Huh?

691
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,280
What's the matter? Are you missing something?

692
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,020
My money...

693
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,390
Watch where you're going! Watch it! 

694
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,440
I think I've been had. The guy who bumped into me just now.

695
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,720
I thought so... What do we do, Senior?

696
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,760
Really, that guy will suffer the wrath of the earth gods for many reasons.

697
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:36,220
Hey, this won't do. Put your hats on and leave in order.

698
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,890
Slowly one-by-one so we don't look suspicious.

699
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,380
But, is this allowed?

700
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,560
If you use your skills for personal reasons, I heard that you have to write a explanatory statement...

701
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,620
I will make sure you don't have to, so don't worry, huh?

702
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,640
23rd class leave first.

703
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,610
There's always a way.

704
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,870
What kind of a way? You have a plan?

705
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,170
You will soon find out.

706
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,920
Hey, you guys...!

707
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,710
I need your help.

708
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,280
Are you going to vouch for him? He can't leave until you do.

709
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,070
I think there's a misunderstanding. I did come here because of a phone call, but I don't know this person.

710
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:07,180
I've never received any help myself.

711
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,620
I'm not sure how to help.

712
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,200
Didn't you come here because he contacted you?

713
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,420
Let's establish that we know each  other. I'll help, too, along the lines of Oppa Tae Hee's memory.

714
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,200
I just got to know him well. Dine and dash...

715
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,490
That is a vulgar charge, never heard of. Where should I sign?

716
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:32,130
I'm this kind of person...

717
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:37,080
You!  You have a business card?

718
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,760
What happened? Why do you have a business card?

719
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,320
Uncle down the hall! Eat this tofu.

720
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,200
Did you know? He has a business card.

721
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,010
A business card? Of course, he has one. He owns our company.

722
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:02,970
Hotel, commerce, vessels, oil, construction, furniture and all.  You didn't know?

723
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:06,180
That's enough. You don't have to tell him. I'm that big of a person.

724
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,990
Uncle, tofu, tofu. Hurry.

725
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:10,710
I really wanted to try this kind of thing.

726
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:14,790
Like uncle, like nephew. Forget it. Get out of the way.

727
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:20,460
Why does he always walk like that?

728
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,630
I know! That time when he said he sees something when he touches someone...

729
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:29,030
A person's past life.

730
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:34,950
When he touches someone he sees the past? Then how about you? Do you have any specialties?

731
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,530
My specialty is being alive.

732
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,960
You don't have any other than making it rain, right?

733
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,370
Uncle! Tofu, tofu.

734
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,600
I guess the miscellaneously omitted isn't home yet.

735
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,100
Maybe she's meeting that buddy?

736
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,950
- Hello? 
- Where are you right now?

737
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:15,560
Do you know what time it is already to be not back in this dangerous world?

738
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,760
It's 7 p.m. right now and I'm busy right now. 

739
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,630
H-Hello?

740
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,590
The phone is off and you will be connected to the voice messaging system 

741
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,700
after the beep. You will be charged a connection fee. 

742
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:42,050
If you've seen the goblin bride, raise your hand.

743
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,450
- Where?
- Uncle!

744
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,390
Uncle.

745
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,000
- Your uncle's not here. He went out. 
- Oh, he did?

746
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,180
Then, can you give this to Uncle for me?

747
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,030
I keep forgetting to give it to him and leaving it in the car.

748
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,550
Why do you bother with the delivery after he took away your card?

749
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,980
My grandpa said he'd give me spending money after I delivered it.

750
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:10,190
- Human beings... 
- This is how scary and convenient capitalism is, Uncle down the hall.

751
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,480
But this... He gave you the card.

752
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,630
And he gave me the house.

753
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,670
So to your grandfather, it must be something much more expensive.

754
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,020
Is that right? I don't know what it is either.

755
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,810
Since I don't know, should I look? Since Uncle's not here, anyway?

756
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,930
Wow, pretty. Pretty.

757
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:54,150
Who is it? Maybe Uncle's old girlfriend?

758
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,240
But it kind of just looks like an antique, too. Right?

759
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,390
Uncle down the hall, what's wrong?

760
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,720
It was destined to be a gut-wrenching love from the start.

761
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:56,560
It's sad, that thing called fate.

762
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,810
Love is not a crime.

763
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:04,840
So perhaps they did not commit a crime.

764
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,880
What crime did I commit,

765
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,500
that you raise the rent so suddenly?

766
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:15,140
It's really hard on me for you to raise the rent by $100 suddenly.

767
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,050
Ever since you moved in, Bachelor,

768
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:20,680
the Grim Reaper keeps appearing in my dreams.

769
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:25,950
I see. Also, the water in the bathroom keeps leaking.

770
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,660
- About when do you plan to...  
- Really? Then don't wash.

771
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,720
You're still pretty even if you don't wash.

772
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,040
♬  I’m dreaming all day  ♬

773
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,260
♬  With my eyes tightly shut  ♬

774
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,330
♬  I call out your name  ♬

775
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:46,530
♬  A steady stream of smiles  ♬

776
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,330
♬  How is ths possible?  ♬

777
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:53,090
♬  Just once for everyone  ♬

778
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:57,380
♬   there is such a day  ♬

779
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:03,400
♬  You blow up my heart, my heart  ♬

780
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,910
You sing well.

781
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,690
A bit.

782
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,900
How did you know I was there?

783
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,500
No matter how you run, you're in my palm.

784
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,220
- What about the chicken shop? Did you get fired?
- I added more part-time work.

785
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,480
The pay is good for wedding singing.

786
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,300
But when I watch the wedding ceremony,

787
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,980
it feels kind of strange.

788
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,880
What about it is strange?

789
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:05,250
Just that... "Oh, I guess I won't have a mom to light the candle."

790
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,800
"Oh, I won't have a dad who'll walk me in, either."

791
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,500
"No friend to take my picture."

792
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:18,770
"Since I don't have friends, I guess I won't get wedding gift money, either." Those thoughts.

793
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,310
Funny, right?

794
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,270
That's why

795
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,520
I was obsessing about being your bride, I think.

796
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,450
Because it felt like I was getting a family.

797
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,140
That family that I don't have. Like fate,

798
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,300
it came to me, I thought.

799
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:54,540
Why do you cry?

800
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:57,220
To make me feel sorry?

801
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:01,030
No. If we argue it out,

802
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,990
I should be the one to feel sorry.

803
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,820
You know what?

804
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:10,040
I'm really sorry, Mister,

805
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,820
that I couldn't pull the sword out.

806
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,140
I kept wanting to tell you this.

807
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,930
But lately we keep fighting when we meet.

808
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:25,220
The timing is a little off here,

809
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,840
but since we're talking about it, I will say it.

810
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,180
I've gotten more work now,

811
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,650
and I'm making the preparations now.

812
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:39,020
So could you just wait a little bit until I leave?

813
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:41,220
Without mistreating me?

814
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,450
Until I am ready to leave,

815
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,240
can you give me a discount on the mistreatment?

816
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,230
As a test-taking student, give me 50% off, please?

817
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,130
I can't give you a discount.

818
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,880
50% is a definite no.

819
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:33,110
45%?

820
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:49,670
What is it? Are you in pain? Could it be because of the sword?

821
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,190
Mister...

822
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,720
I can grab the sword!

823
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:30,600
Wait a moment.

824
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,920
Wait a moment. I'll pull it out for you.

825
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,130
It is moving.

826
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:27,150
The oracle was right. 

827
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,840
The future seen for me was correct. 

828
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:36,830
Through this child, 

829
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,010
I can now end this curse of immortality 

830
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,370
and return to nothingness.

831
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,930
Human life is 100 years at best.

832
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,190
To want to turn back and look once more, 

833
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,740
is it my immortal life? 

834
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,980
Or your face? 

835
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:12,880
It seems it's your face. 

836
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,010
♬  I'll certainly find you  ♬

837
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,720
♬  I'll certainly recognize you ♬

838
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:42,630
♬ Wherever you are. Whatever you look like♬

839
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,100
♬ I'll see you.  ♬

840
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,540
♬  I'll certainly remember ♬

841
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:52,350
♬ l will recognize you ♬

842
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:56,450
♬  Even at a place without you, even if many years pass  ♬

843
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:00,220
♬   l will not forget  ♬

844
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,590
See? I really am the bride. 

845
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,320
This was fated to be. 

846
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:10,590
Fate. How cool. 

847
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,750
Who are you, 

848
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:17,940
that you pierce my heart like this? 

849
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,630
I feel like I've seen her somewhere. 

850
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:29,610
How did he remember his past life? 

851
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,870
After living like that for hundreds of years, on that day,

852
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,840
on a day that was just right. 

853
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:42,650
After living like that for hundreds of years, on that day,

854
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:46,120
on a day that was just right 

855
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,110
It was first love. 

856
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:51,020
To be able to confess that. 

857
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:53,640
I'm seeking 

858
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:56,220
heaven's permiddion.
