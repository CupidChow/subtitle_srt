1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,650
Goblin

2
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:49,950
Goblin

3
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,550
♫ How can I get over you? ♫

4
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,880
♫ Why do we have to be ♫

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,220
♫ Apart ♫

6
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,460
Mister!

7
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,930
♫ I'm still discovering ♫

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,350
Mass is not directly proportional to volume. 
 (Physics of Love)

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,780
A girl as small as a violet flower.

10
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,500
A girl who moves like a flower's petal.

11
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,480
Is pulling me towards her with a stronger force than her mass.

12
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,000
At that moment,

13
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,260
just like Newton's apple,

14
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,680
without stopping, I rolled towards her until I fell on her

15
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,840
...with a loud thump.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,620
...with a thump, thump.

17
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,480
The red carpet was awesome! You were the one who did it, right?

18
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
It's so fascinating!

19
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,200
Mister!

20
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,600
My heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.

21
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,710
Mister, are you mad?

22
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,490
It was first love!

23
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,960
- Episode 5 -

24
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,230
I... will walk.

25
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,070
It's okay to stop the car over there.

26
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,660
I memorized the area around the hotel,

27
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,160
- and if I walk I will be there soon-- 
- Do that then.

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,970
Goodbye!

29
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,250
Only the Goblin's bride

30
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,010
can remove the sword.

31
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,860
Once the sword is pulled out, the owner will return to nothingness and be at peace.

32
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,070
 Sometimes in life, a strange genre suddenly gets into the mix.

33
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,970
What genre was your day?

34
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,330
A romantic comedy? A strange, but beautiful fantasy?

35
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,680
A sad melodrama?

36
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,080
Can you not do this?

37
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,330
Talk to me like a normal person. You scare me when you act like this.

38
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm sorry for startling you. I want to ask you for a favor.

39
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,330
I'm really sorry for asking this, but can you fill up the refrigerator that's in the room where I used to live?

40
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,830
The refrigerator?

41
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,050
It hasn't been too long since I passed away. Mom was busy with the funeral and hasn't been to my place yet.

42
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,520
If my mom finds out that the refrigerator is empty,

43
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,860
she will be heartbroken. Please help me out!

44
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,560
But... I don't have any money.

45
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,550
Ah... I wasn't able to think that far... I'm sorry.

46
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,380
Ah! There is a way!

47
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,640
Thanks.

66
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,670
What's this? Is it a coincidence?

67
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,270
It's not for me. Why didn't you call me?
 I was waiting. You said you would!

68
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,660
I will do it. I'll go and do it right now.

69
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,950
Go where? Are you going to look for a pay phone?

70
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,340
I have a phone at home. At home... I'll call soon.

71
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,610
So funny!

72
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,070
When we've bumped into each other like this?

73
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,450
Ah! It was nice to see you.

74
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,940
It's driving me crazy...

75
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,900
Instead of a phone call right now, how about coffee right now ?

76
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,680
There are a lot of coffee shops in Seoul and I have a lot of free time..

77
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,560
♬ You keep on asking ♬

78
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,000
♬  You always want to verify  ♬

79
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,410
Excuse me...

80
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,460
Are we just going to keep drinking coffee? When the sun has gone down?

81
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,990
Isn't the daylight too short?

82
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,860
It's not short. You've been like that for an hour.

83
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,460
Aren't we going to say hello? We're not going to ask how we've been?

84
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,480
We aren't going to have a conversation?

85
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,230
Hello. Have you been well?

86
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,910
♬ You're so beautiful. You're beautiful. I said you're beautiful. ♬

87
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,170
Yes. Have you been well, too?

88
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,890
Is my ring well? You still don't have a phone?

89
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,470
Yes, I've been well.

90
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,530
The ring is fine. I don't have a phone.

91
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,540
♬ Your expression seems angry ♬

92
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,990
♬ Your not talking makes me anxious  ♬

93
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,220
Be honest with me. You forgot my name, right?

94
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,340
It's Sun Hyo.

95
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,930
It's Sunny, not Sun Hyo.

96
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,380
♬ I have no idea.

97
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,820
Seriously...

98
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,120
You are such a funny man!

99
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,610
Are you acting like this on purpose?

100
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,230
♬ What you want to hear   ♬

101
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,270
What are you staring at?

102
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,490
I can't help looking... when you smile.

103
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,140
♬ You're beautiful. You're beautiful. I said you're beautiful ♬

104
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,170
♬  Why don't you believe what I say?  ♬

105
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,630
Now that I think about it, I don't know your name. What's your name?

106
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,520
♬  You expression seems angry  ♬

107
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,750
She asked my name, but even I don't know it.

108
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,950
She asked me how I was, too. To ask someone who's not alive if they are doing well?

109
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,460
That girl's smile

110
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,570
in the sunlight of the brightest time of the day, Oshi. (11am-1pm) 

111
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,140
That moment during which I am reminded of the moment my life was shattered. 

112
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,720
I made up my mind.

113
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,500
I must disappear.

114
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,500
Before I want to live longer,

115
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,380
before I want to become happier...

116
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,270
For you,

117
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,160
I have made the inevitable decision

118
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,090
to leave this world.

119
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,450
But... I hear your voice.

120
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,350
Are you really going to die?

121
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,310
Yeah.  Before the first snow of the year.

122
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,880
[$1,540]

123
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,550
By any chance, did you drink?

124
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,760
No way.

125
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,930
Yes, you did. The refrigerator is completely empty.

126
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,980
Chocolate, peanuts, even  beef jerky, there is nothing left.

127
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,330
Fine, you could eat and drink.

128
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,940
However, why did you throw away the empty bottles? You thought I wouldn't notice if you threw the bottles away?

129
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,620
I had my reasons...

130
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,340
Chairman said that if I need anything I should say it.

131
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,890
I'm sorry, but can you pay for me? I don't have money.

132
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,980
I don't have any money either. I don't...

133
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,190
I... don't have any money.

134
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,240
I was about to pay--

135
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,020
Oh, you startled me.

136
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,420
I'm going in.

137
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,450
Mister, why are you here? Deok Hwa told you everything?

138
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,160
Like what?

139
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,940
The thing is... he told me off.

140
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,600
He isn't someone with such a clear conscience where he can tell others off.

141
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,160
I emptied out the refrigerator completely.

142
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,940
Couldn't you pay this somehow... ?

143
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,320
Once I get my pay from my part-time job I will repay you diligently.

144
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,380
It's not possible?

145
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,860
To be honest, you're the one who drank the alcohol.

146
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,630
I used the rest for a good cause.

147
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,190
If you ignore me, I will blow all these out.

148
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,840
I can make you come in and out of here all day today.

149
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,630
Don't make wishes anymore.

150
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,220
You don't have to do it anymore, because I will be by your side from now on.

151
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,970
Let's go home.

152
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,940
Which house... ?

153
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,990
The house where I live,

154
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,360
since you are the Goblin's bride.

155
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,970
Mister, do you love me?

156
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,260
If that's needed, I will do that, too.

157
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,920
I love you.

158
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,070
Do you dislike me that much?

159
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,130
How much and how do you dislike me that you are this sad?

160
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,390
The rain just continues to pour.

161
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,080
Well, it's fine.

162
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,000
Even if you dislike me, even if you're sad, I'm still going to live at your house.

163
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,370
I'm in no position to be picky about whether I get a cold or warm goblin.

164
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,540
In the end, all I have to do is to take the sword out, right?

165
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,940
Yes, that's all you have to do.

166
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,050
Please wait. I'm going to pack my things.

167
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,990
Mister, what's your name?

168
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,930
I'm not asking because I'm so curious.

169
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:06,570
Regardless of the fact that we are in a vague relationship that's closer than cohabiting but farther than a marriage,

170
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,330
I'm the Goblin's bride.

171
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,370
I should at least know the name of the Goblin who's going to be my husband.

172
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,140
Us... I guess there's no "us" yet.

173
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,470
I think it started before you were born.

174
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,260
Us.

175
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,630
Sometimes Yoo Jeong Shin; other times, Yoo Jae Shin.

176
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,620
Currently I'm Yoo Shin Jae.

177
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,410
My real name is... Kim Shin.

178
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,350
We can go...

179
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,410
It's green light.

180
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,470
Today... is the day we put out the trash.

181
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,190
You are refreshing every time I see you.

182
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,030
Give it to me. I will do that from now on.

183
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,670
What's with her? Why is she trying to impress me all of a sudden?

184
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,460
She will be living with us starting today.

185
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,910
For your sake, the choice that I have to make...

186
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,290
is to end my life.

187
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm rooting for the path that's ahead of you and the things you will do. Let's go inside.

188
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,250
Yes. Please take care of me.

189
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,200
So, the thing that I will be doing in the future... there must be a lot of housework.

190
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,150
It must be 4 digits, right?

191
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,080
Probably have to press the star (*) at the end...

192
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,640
You don't know the passcode? Both of you?

193
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,990
We've never keyed in the code before going in.

194
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,080
It reminds me of that moment... Right before you go in the haunted house at an amusement park.

195
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,140
You feel scared and nervous, and you don't know what's inside.

196
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,520
And you wonder if you'll be able to come out safely once you go in.

197
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,450
Come in.

198
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,660
You... Why here... ? Why is she... When and how is she here?

199
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,960
She's going to be living with us starting today.

200
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
Please take care of me.

201
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,640
Tell her the passcode.

202
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,370
1004 (Angel). But why is she living here?
(T/N: "cheon sa" -  1004 and angel are homonyms in the Korean language.)

203
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,910
Why? What about me? About me?

204
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,800
You drink that in one go. Sober up.

205
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,050
We should get a cozy chair right about there.

206
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,620
Is this a photo studio? It would be better to have pastel colored wallpapers that soothe your emotions.

207
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,190
Is this a kindergarten?

208
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,210
We'll put 19th-century romanticism art. And a fireplace here would be good.

209
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,160
Is this a hotel? Over there, we should have a Scandinavian style wallpaper.

210
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,740
- Is this a model house? She's my guest!
- It's my house!

211
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,980
It's my room.

212
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,870
I'm okay with everything.

213
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,530
We'll put up some 19th-century romantic art style wallpaper on this side.

214
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,950
And we'll put a pastel-toned fireplace over here. To be fair.

215
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:15,120
Then for now, should I sleep on the living room sofa today?

216
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,150
If you are uncomfortable having me in the living room, the flower garden is okay, too.

217
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,880
I'm not in the position to discriminate where to sleep.

218
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,840
- So, if you are going to bring someone in, you should get a bed fi--
- Sleep in my room tonight.

219
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,210
With you?

220
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,700
No!

221
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,990
Then what about you?

222
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,370
- What does this mean?
- I shall sleep on the bed,

223
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,490
so don't worry about me and sleep comfortably on the sofa.

224
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,650
Look at how strangely this Goblin talks. Never. It's my bed. You'll make it unlucky.

225
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,830
I know. I told you not to concern yourself.

226
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,080
- Go and sleep in the sofa in the living room.
- I can't sleep on the sofa.

227
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,440
- She'll probably be going in and out.
- Then go sleep in a hotel!

228
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,190
I can't sleep at a hotel. She's in that room alone.

229
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,580
Where are you going?

230
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,640
The miscellaneously omitted... I'll make her sleep in the flower garden.

231
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,710
- Were you always this inconsiderate?
- Yeah.

232
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,480
- Then I will sleep on the sofa.
- Don't talk to me.

233
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,520
Please help her a lot when she's around.

234
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,660
Aigoo. It's so comfortable.

235
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,750
Do I have to sit like this?

236
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,380
My book.

237
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,070
I told him to look at it. Did I tell him he could have it?

238
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,200
[The stars might take your grief away]

239
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,610
He didn't throw it away.

240
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,440
He's preciously cherishing it.

241
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,400
What book is this?

242
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,570
I don't know Chinese characters.

243
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,190
Even in a foreign land, the war does not stop.

244
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,020
With swords and arrows, snatching the land and the grains. 

245
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,250
Taking lives.

246
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,560
The god of the foreign land and the god of Goryeo are all the same. 

247
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,580
The child who left Goryeo with me...

248
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,440
I buried him and his grandchild's grandchild.

249
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:12,950
I, in a chair in a corner of a room,

250
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,450
I spent days and weeks.

251
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,530
My will is not words that are left in the face of death.

252
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,020
Dear God, 

253
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,610
my last testament is to ask you for death. 

254
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,550
Though I have at times regarded this life as a reward, in the end my life was a  punishment. 

255
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,840
Anyone's death...

256
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,930
I couldn't forget one.

257
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,650
So I...

258
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,490
am to end this life.

259
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,860
However, God is not listening as always.

260
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,000
Have you seen God?

261
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,390
Perhaps, are you looking at him now?

262
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,500
I told you not to talk to me. How could someone like me see God?

263
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,950
I have seen him before.

264
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,300
- What does he look like?
 - Just...

265
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,280
It was a butterfly.

266
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,320
It's always like that. It makes you unable to touch a passing butterfly recklessly.

267
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,100
If he had at least shown me his face,

268
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,390
then I could resent him objectively.

269
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,050
I know.

270
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,960
If God really does only give you how much you can handle,

271
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,450
I wonder if he didn't overestimate me.

272
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,820
Are you having a hard time?

273
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,530
Don't worry.  I won't cry in your arms.

274
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,280
God whom humans see that often...

275
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,480
how could we not see him even once?

276
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,580
Right, this is the Goblin's house.

277
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,500
I wonder what they do for breakfast.

278
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,440
I wonder if there's any groceries.

279
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,710
They have everything that's needed,

280
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,510
but it feels lonely somehow...

281
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,990
How beautiful.

282
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,710
I wondered how it would be since it's a men's household.

283
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:38,570
It's been such a long time since I've had a meal prepared by someone.

284
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,910
I didn't say I was going to give you any.

285
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,470
Thank you for the meal.

286
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,920
I will earn my own allowance. And starting tomorrow, I will take care of my own meals.

287
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,700
- I will also do the laundry myself. 
 - That's how we usually do it.

288
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,570
A wealthy household like this usually has helpers that do--

289
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,390
What's this? Did you practice without me knowing?

290
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,230
You seem to be in top form.

291
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,540
Since you two are like this, I see why you can't get any helpers.

292
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,950
So I wrote down a few things in a similar context.

293
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,550
I wish you would abide by them.

294
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,230
My appeals. First, I hope it doesn't rain often.

295
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,010
Since the citizens would be uncomfortable, so as long as I am living here, I wish you would be happy.

296
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,400
2. If you have any complaints, please say them. Saying that you'll take me

297
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,230
or you would make things that could make you take me, I hope there would be none of those.

298
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,440
3. If you have something urgent, please call first. Don't just suddenly appear in front of me.

299
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,940
Ji Eun Tak. 010-1234-1234. And you can't do so during class hours.

300
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,490
Not during work and I turn it off in the library.  That's all.

301
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,050
I will be going to school.

302
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,240
Could she be telling us to call her?

303
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,870
Is she looking down on us because we don't have cellphones?

304
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,650
Really?

305
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:36,410
I want this one in chic black. I like it. You have this bluish-blue. You like it?

306
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,550
This punk is over-excited since it's his first time seeing something like this. Explain it.

307
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,570
Now, now. Take your time memorizing your numbers. This is called a smart phone...

308
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,110
I'm okay, so just explain it to him who's never seen this before.

309
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,530
What he said is right. You only need to explain to me.

310
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,130
Uncle, do you know how to use it? This thing is very smart--

311
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,390
Do you think I didn't use it because I don't know how?

312
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,550
- It's because I don't have any need--
- When I watch dramas,

I know. I can't see your face, though.

Not that. He's actually a goblin, but since people are scared of him

he's wearing his favorite buckwheat hoodie and pretending he's not a goblin.

468
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:28,440
♬  I'm getting used to your casual way of speaking   ♬

469
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,330
♬  The feeling like excitement  is not because I like you ♬

470
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,480
[If you're bored while studying, the sword, please.]

471
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,350
♬ Love, that empty feeling.  Lately it's been strange. ♬

472
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,500
[I know you are busy studying, but when you have time, the sword, please.]

473
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,830
♬ Love, even when the moonlit night falls.  ♬

474
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:52,310
♬  It's confusing me. ♬

475
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:57,120
[I know it's hard to study but for a moment, the sword, please.]

476
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,130
♬   What  do you think?  ♬

477
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,710
♬  You, you, you if you feel alone  ♬

478
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,570
♬  You and I feel the same  ♬

479
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:10,620
[I know you feel lonely while studying, but if you get a chance, the sword, please.

480
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,550
And keep this a secret from my colleague.]

481
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,040
You startled me.

482
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,710
What is your dream? What do you want to be?

483
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,680
While eating this much and not taking out the sword and just studying, what is your dream?

484
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,050
A radio PD (program director). For the rolling admission, I studied that department as well.

485
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:33,140
That's not what I'm saying. How will you get accepted to college when lacking such comprehension?

486
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,040
Why would you wish me bad?

487
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,470
Actually I thought about it carefully,

488
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:47,830
and about you getting pretty, I put it on hold for now.

489
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,800
On hold? Are you sure you thought about it carefully?

490
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:56,200
What if you kick me out after I lose my effective value? The thought of that is so stressful that I can't study.

491
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,900
If you can't even study, then why are you finishing up the snacks every time?

492
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,610
See! Your true colors are showing. You begrudge it?

493
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,710
That's why, how nice would it have been if you gave me the $5000 when I asked?

494
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,370
Hey, still, I am water and fire and someone who's here but not,

495
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,100
so how can I be so crass as to bounce it off with cash?

496
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,210
I'd accept it with refinement, of course.

497
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,460
But... why does it have to be $5000?

498
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,740
The amount is too ambiguous. It'll be hard to even rent a place with that in Seoul.

499
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,060
I don't even dare to dream about renting a place.

500
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,450
Until I become an adult, it's money to stay at a sauna,

501
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:38,400
and if ever I do get accepted into college then I would need tuition.

502
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,170
I came up with that exact amount

503
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,670
after careful calculation of student loans and various living costs.

504
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,930
That ambiguous $5000 is like $5,000,000 to someone like me who has nothing. Happy?

505
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:01,970
Give her $5000. How could you do that? So coldhearted.

506
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:02,970
I have something I am curious about.

507
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,330
I won't give you $5000 (ohbaek).

508
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,440
That startled me. I heard it as confess (gobaek).

509
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,150
Give her $5000.

510
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,040
Make your pronunciation clear. I got startled!

511
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,210
He said to give me $5000.

512
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,130
Go and study.

513
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,850
But, then, is your name Kim Shin?

514
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,390
Yeah. Why?

515
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,050
Your name... is really cool.

516
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,270
Seriously, he's not calling. Call.

517
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:57,670
Boss, are you busy?

518
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,400
I don't even remember when I was last busy.

519
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:11,060
Then... can I call you Unni for a while? I have no unni that I can confide in.

520
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,690
Wanting to call me unni... then there's only one genre.

521
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,770
Are you pregnant?

522
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,430
No!

523
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,450
- Then? 
 - Just...

524
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,470
What do you think about marrying early?

525
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,740
How old is the guy? 19? 20?

526
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,870
A bit more.

527
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,440
It's not much even if you say so. What kind of kid is he?

528
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:42,310
He's always near books, he has deep taste in music and art, and he also used to work for the country back then...

529
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:46,630
Not that, what does he do to you? Does he treat you well?

530
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,000
Ahhh...

531
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,310
For now. Since he needs me.

532
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,040
Then what about you? Do you like that punk?

533
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,950
No.

534
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,860
Then what about that punk, does he like you?

535
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,330
No.

536
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,050
What's that then? Both of you don't like each other. Why do this marriage?

537
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,210
I know, right.

538
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,080
What's with this marriage?

539
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,680
Continue with your work.

540
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:37,220
Mister, do you love me?

541
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,860
If that is needed, I will do that, too.

542
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,180
I love you.

543
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,680
I don't need that love.

544
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,810
Make sure you're not the one who needs it.

545
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,380
Just wait and see if I let him become pretty...

546
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,140
I'm back.

547
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,610
Are you folding laundry? I will do it, too.

548
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,170
You were always doing this by yourself before, right? I can tell.

549
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,610
Thank you for recognizing it.

550
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:32,690
So all the bathroom towels are washed by Mr. Grim Reaper. No wonder it felt killer.

551
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,410
Can you please refrain from the expression "killer".

552
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,010
I'm sorry.

553
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:46,210
I really like the towels in this house. They are soft and fluffy.

554
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:49,430
Thank you.

555
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,030
Netherland's representative painter of the 17th century royal family.

556
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:59,520
Rembrand van Rijn's painting best known as "The Night Watch" unveiling the spectrum of light and darkness.

557
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,740
But actually the true name of the paiting is "The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq." Where should I hang it?

558
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,440
That scarf, I think I saw that when you were 9. It's the same one, right?

559
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,180
You're right.

560
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,990
It's a keepsake from my mom.

561
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,780
My mom thought that I could see ghosts because of the mark on my neck.

562
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:34,730
So she always placed this around my neck since I was a child in hopes that I wouldn't see ghosts when it's covered.

563
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:42,110
But it was no use. But it became a habit. Now this is like my mom.

564
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,360
- Give her $5000 (ohbaek).
- Why do keep on telling me to confess (gobaek)?

565
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,470
And also you! You've got a story to every question. I'm too scared to even ask you a question now.

566
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:55,920
- What's with him?
- I didn't reply to you though.

567
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,170
He has a really bad personality.

568
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,120
You must have had a hard time.

569
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,240
But, have you decided on a name?

570
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,420
Hey, Senior. Aren't you going to study? You might not get into college if you do well (keep it up).

571
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,180
Why would I not get in if I do well? If I do well then I would go in.

572
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,310
Nevermind. Go in and study. Would you be a radio PD if you do that?

573
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,650
Oh, you want to be a radio PD? So cool.

574
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,870
Yes, I liked radios since I was a child.

575
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,880
I was the one who mentioned about radio but why are you talking to him?

576
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,380
Talking with people that I live with--

577
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:28,780
People? See if there are any people that you live with. Look at the sword here!

578
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:34,990
Mister, perhaps if you haven't decided on a name, how about Park Bo Gum? Park Bo Gum (gum=sword)?

579
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:41,240
What "gum?" Just because I have been lenient because you see the sword!

580
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,910
Seriously.

581
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:48,170
Whose fault is it that I have this mark and that I can see ghosts?

582
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:50,510
Have what? It's pretty.

583
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,860
Mister, did you just lift my hair?

584
00:54:53,860 --> 00:55:00,190
Ahh! That's why you got stabbed with a sword. People get stabbed for a reason.

585
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,960
How could you poke a person where it hurts? 
Are you a psychopath?

586
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,300
Mister, do you think you weren't like that at first? You said I wasn't the goblin's bride, don't live in rumors but in reality.

587
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,190
You must think you've never poked where it hurts and you're all soft and fluffy!

588
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,880
I said that for your sake! For you.

589
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,410
If it's for me, give me a boyfriend! Part-time work, my aunt's family, and boyfriend!

590
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,060
My wish for a boyfriend has not come true yet!

591
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,250
- It's here! Your boyfriend!
- Where? Where here?

592
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,190
Here! Right in front of you! Me!

593
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,900
He must be crazy. What boyfriend?

594
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,440
According to whom? Does he like me?

595
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,150
So outrageous.

596
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,700
That was a slip of the tongue for the first time in 900 years.

597
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,530
Technically, it would be husband not boyfriend.

598
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,890
Should I go and make the correction minutely?

599
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,380
This is troublesome.

600
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:52,040
Someone can't even make a phone call because he has no name.

601
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,350
They are just...

602
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:04,700
Someone can't even make a phone call because he has no name.

603
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,970
They are just...

604
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,960
- It's so dark in here.
- What are you doing?
- You're still at that?

605
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,460
Leave. Both of you.

606
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,870
What's wrong with Uncle down the hall?

607
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,920
It a face that's thinking of a woman.

608
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,140
What did I do? What? Where?

609
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:24,510
This must be that woman's number.

610
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,320
Put that down while I'm talking.

611
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,900
Uncle, this kiss mark, did you try kissing it or not? Honestly?

612
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,550
You need to follow me. That place won't be a good one.

613
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,460
- Uncle.
 - It's going.

614
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,300
Hey! Don't!

615
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,790
If you won't call then why get her number?

616
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,700
To appear human. You never know when I would call.

617
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,880
Now is that time.

618
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,940
Hello?

619
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,520
Like a human. Hurry.

620
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,910
Not Seon Hee, but Sunny

621
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,540
Hello, I am...

622
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,240
No. Should I go roughly?

623
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,450
What are you doing? Don't you recognize my voice?

624
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,890
Not this, either.

625
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,230
Hello. Oh my! Hello.

626
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:25,920
- I go for the third.
- Hello.  Were you  listening?

627
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,850
Why aren't you getting caught?

628
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:32,480
Isn't it cool? Fascinating, right? I could do this, too.

629
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,400
Ding.

630
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,250
- What's this?
- Eat, eat.

631
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,430
Freeze.

632
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,790
Hello.

633
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,970
Hello.

634
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:02,640
You know how to call.

635
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,520
I thought you didn't or maybe you broke a finger.

636
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,540
Ah, yes. I learned. My finger is not broken. Thank you for the concern.

637
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,520
So my number was there.

638
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,850
Yes. Your number is here.

639
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,700
I waited for your call.

640
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,560
Ahh... yes.

641
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,400
"Ahh... yes." Is there nothing after?

642
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,480
Don't you have anything more you want to say?

643
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,570
- For example?
- Morning, lunch or night? When is the most comfortable time to meet or something like that.

644
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,540
Morning, lunch time or night? When is the most comfortable time to meet?

645
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,600
I find it comfortable to meet in the morning and separate at night.

646
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,990
I must seem human, so I'll walk.

647
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:50,110
Get in.

648
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,540
A human won't be able to walk all the way to Incheon.

649
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,240
Ah!

650
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:07,850
- It's here. Your boyfriend!
- Where? Where here?
- Right here! In front of you! Me!

651
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,150
I was startled because you were in front of me.

652
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:24,030
I was thirsty... that... I have to go to work.

653
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,080
Ji Eun Tak...

654
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,020
- Yes? 
 - Huh?

655
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,560
You called me just now.

656
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,660
- I did?
- Yes.
- Why? 
- I know.  Why?

657
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,270
Because it's awkward.

658
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,630
Me, too.

659
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:58,300
Then... should I say I'm hungry, naturally?

660
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:05,760
Will you? Then I will naturally say, "Do you want to eat beef?"

661
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,850
I will go and get my coat then come out. Go and  put your coat on.

662
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,780
I'm done putting it on. Let's go. Let's go.

663
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:25,090
Wow! This is my second time here. I might be a regular at this rate.

664
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:28,760
We sat there back then.

665
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:38,850
Welcome to Quebec. Please have a seat.

666
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,430
I know, right? I've never been abroad before so I didn't know.

667
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:14,860
So why travel abroad at 29? When I was 29, I didn't even go to the supermarket in front of my house. 

668
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,490
- Really?
- Yeah, becauseI didn't have any appointment.

669
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:22,400
I've been traveling around just fine, for someone who's never been abroad before.

670
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,050
I'll only get lost a little, I won't skip meals and I will eat a big chunk of cow.

671
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,960
I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.

672
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,720
It's the man that has to be nice, not the restaurant. I have to go. I'm sleepy.

673
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,520
Okay. Have a good night.

674
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,990
CEO, over here.

675
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,890
At the age of 29, you're still shining.

676
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:26,600
But I'm not... by your side.

677
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:36,650
My life of eternity has finally come to an end.

678
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:42,510
In the time after my death, you are still here.

679
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:52,530
You've forgotten me  and your life is perfectly complete with me gone. 

680
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,720
I have to disappear

681
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,730
to make you smile.

682
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,190
This is the decision I have to make.

683
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:11,060
I have to end my life.

684
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:33,600
♬  Where I am, who I am (who I am)  ♬

685
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,540
♬  Loneliness like a prison  ♬

686
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,620
In the end,

687
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:43,480
that's the decision I made.

688
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:50,090
♬ This place where everyone passes me  ♬

689
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,630
♬   Oh, where I am  ♬

690
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:01,950
♬   Who are you? Who are you? (Who are you?) ♬

691
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:07,560
♬ Overwhelming joy♬

692
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:16,300
♬ Turned this world inside out like crazy ♬

693
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:23,290
♬  ♬  Even in my dream I'm grasping for you. Where are you?  ♬

694
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:26,930
♬   I certainly will find you   ♬

695
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,670
♬   I certainly will recognize you   ♬

697
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,990
♬   I’ll certainly recognize you   ♬

698
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,730
♬  I certainly will remember. ♬

699
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:45,510
♬  I certainly will recognize you.   ♬

701
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,610

702
01:05:52,610 --> 01:06:00,250
♬  Your speech, expression, everything   ♬

703
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,010
- Preview -

704
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,430
He's still handsome and still strange.

705
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,430
I know he's strange but when I see his face, I forget all that.

706
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:23,030
You don't press down the head like that. 

707
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:30,110
You're supposed to brush it gently.

708
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:36,770
Can you make me prettier now?

709
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:42,020
- Yes.
- You shouldn't get hurt anymore.

710
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,490
You've been hurt many times.

711
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,640
I left the deed of the property in the room.

712
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,460
This is really your house now.

713
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,600
Have a long and happy life.

714
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,370
And I have a favor to ask.

715
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:08,910
When I disappear, her mark will disappear, too.

716
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:16,920
When that happens, erase her memories. Don't let her blame herself.
