- Episode 13 -

5
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,860
As expected, I seem to be the worst memory.

6
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:43,210
- To you too ... Kim Shin, to him also. You hear my voice, right?

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,710
I also can hear your voice. Very clearly.

8
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,720
General Kim Shin...

9
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,400
is here to see Your Majesty.

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,490
After 900 years

11
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,560
I am seeing you, Your Majesty.

12
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,650
Whether my eyes were covered by the 900 years of time

13
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:08,310
or by God's dislike for me, I could not recognize you even though you were next to me.

14
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,260
I see you...

15
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,070
are Wang Yeo.

16
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,750
In the end...

17
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,960
am I him?

18
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,100
Am I...

19
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,920
Wang Yeo?

20
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,880
The young and foolish face...

21
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,990
in the end...

22
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,700
is it me?

23
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,990
The battlefield was always hell, and we came back from that place.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,960
Even the enemies were not able to kill us.

25
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,920
But those men... my young sister...

26
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,880
and my relatives who had no sins...

27
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,100
they were stabbed with swords and shot with arrows in front of my own eyes.

28
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
By an order,

29
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,250
with one word from the young and foolish king.

30
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,950
Am I...

31
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,040
him?

32
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,020
So I really am... Wang Yeo?

33
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,510
I still remember every single minute and second of that living hell every day.

34
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,620
But since you have no memory,

35
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,190
it must be comfortable for you.

36
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,930
Even after 900 years has passed...

37
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,460
When did the heavens side with you?

38
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,570
The heavens, as always, are on your side.

39
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,880
What on earth... did I do?

40
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,960
What memory did I erase?

41
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,100
What choice did I make?

42
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,810
Exactly...

43
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,500
how much of a coward was I?

44
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,610
How did it go? Did you meet Park Joong Hun?

45
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,880
I met him. Park Joong Hun and Wang Yeo, too.

46
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,850
Pack your things lightly and come down. Let's go.

47
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,920
- Where to?
- We are going to Chairman Yoo's main house.

48
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,520
Yes. Just give me 10 minutes.

49
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,970
Ji Eun Tak,

50
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,590
why aren't you asking anything? Did you know...

51
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,770
that he was Wang Yeo?

52
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,400
It was something that the deceased told me. I wasn't sure about his intentions,

53
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,700
so I thought it shouldn't be relayed to you carelessly. However,

54
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,480
whether I told you or not, I thought that a fate that's meant to be avoided will be avoided

55
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,040
and if it's a destined meeting, then you would meet it.

56
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,250
I'm sorry.

57
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,570
Pack your things and come out.

58
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,550
We're going to stay here for now. Let the helpers have a break for the time being.

59
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,700
Okay.  But, Uncle, why are you staying here?

60
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,050
We will use a guest room each on the second floor. You don't have to worry.

61
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,580
Okay.  But, Uncle, why are you staying here?

62
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,910
I... will go to Boss' place.

63
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,550
I'm worried. I'm sure she must be full of questions.

64
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,850
Okay, then I'll ask that of you.

65
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,770
- If something happens...
- I know.

66
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,110
Rest a bit. Opa Deok Hwa  will take me there.

67
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,830
I will?

68
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,710
What is it? Why did you pack your things and leave? Did he fight with Uncle down the hall?

69
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,700
I mean, even if they fought... he should chase Uncle down the hall out. Why leave?

70
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,110
Won't it be consideration? Since Mr. Reaper has no place to go.

71
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,370
Ah... If you put it like that, it's sad.

72
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,140
The phone is turned off. You will be connected to voicemail.

73
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,280
Charges will be made after the beep.

74
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:09,680
You... in this lifetime,  are protecting that dummy again.

75
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,780
What about Orabeoni? Where is he?

76
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,300
He came out of the house with me.

77
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,490
Then what about that person?

78
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,120
I think... he's at the house.

79
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,150
That means he's at least alive.

80
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,700
I don't think he's someone who was alive to begin with...

81
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,680
Right.

82
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:31,100
But then, about you getting the memories from your past life...

83
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,700
how did you remember them?

84
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,180
In an erotic way.

85
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,680
What?

86
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,010
It means, let's drink. Soju or beer?

87
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,680
Part-timer, if a person really has four lives...

88
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,470
I have thought about it, and I think I am living the fourth one.

89
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,010
- Why?
- I know at least two lifetimes.

90
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,480
And since I met my Orabeoni

91
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,980
and my lover in this lifetime...

92
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,130
What about you?

93
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,070
Me... I wish the present would be my first life.

94
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,350
Why? In the second life, third life,

95
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,010
and fourth life, you want to meet my Orabeoni, too?

96
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,170
You should have seen his horrible stubbornness during the Goryeo Dynasty.

97
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,010
He knew he would die, so why did he have to return?

98
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,960
He should have just lived by himself.

99
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I mean, it's unfair for us to have to split the utility bill according to the number of people in the household.

100
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,330
Ever since that woman downstairs came, it went up 4000 won more.

101
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,880
She said she got her apartment's deposit and moved here. She's pitiful.

102
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,190
Then what about me?

103
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,070
I just barely got the deposit together to live on my own for the first time in my life.

104
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:29,450
Well... be it the first or fourth, it's still important.

105
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,120
Isn't that so?

106
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,370
What are you talking about?

107
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,800
And also, the pipes are frozen so water does not come out.

108
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,260
So why do I have to pay equally per person?

109
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,720
Exactly...

110
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
It's sad... fate is.

111
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,840
In the end, will they end up paying so dearly?

112
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,010
I really should not be like this...

113
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,590
What is your name?

114
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,290
Give me cash, the card is not accepted.

115
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,680
Send a message that you died a heroic death and I will send a message that I lament it.

116
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,450
I don't want you to die.

117
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,680
Those two  didn't come for your graduation, they came thinking they will meet someone here..

118
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,100
About Reaper Kim from Jangam-dong,

119
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,870
it is just a rumor

120
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,080
but because of some soul's whispers

121
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,960
he held a dying person's...

122
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,830
hand.

123
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,710
Could that spirit be the one that you lost?

124
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,030
That Miscellaneous Omitted Person?

125
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,290
Are you listening?

126
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,990
Senior!

127
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,760
Huh? What did you say?

128
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,200
What's wrong with you these days?

129
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,980
With a Miscellaneous Omitted Person...

130
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,060
what happened?

131
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,200
Here you are.

132
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,820
Seeing your face,

133
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,870
in the end, you held

134
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,200
that hand.

135
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,490
So what did you see?

136
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,590
What sins were in there?

137
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,630
I wasn't in there.

138
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,740
It was only that woman.

139
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,500
That woman, in the past, in some era

140
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,680
was a queen.

141
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,760
In there, was I there?

142
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,690
Perhaps...

143
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:13,710
is there a hand that brought tonics beside me?

144
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,870
Just like yours, slender and white.

145
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,340
Do you know what was in that tonic?

146
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,140
My sin is your sin.

147
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,780
No. No, there's no way.

148
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,000
The owner of the hands that brought that tonic was you.

149
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,310
How pitiful is this?

150
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,180
Since you have no memories

151
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,510
you don't even recognize yourself.

152
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,220
No...

153
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,020
There's no way.

154
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,350
Don't worry.

155
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,130
I will keep your secret.

156
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,120
More than that, if it gets known that you used your abilities as a reaper

157
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,560
then you will be in trouble.

158
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,980
So both your sins

159
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,180
and my sins...

160
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,100
let's keep them a secret.

161
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,740
As expected, you are Kim Seon.

162
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,630
Even in this life, you will have to die in my hands.

163
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,290
Miscellaneous Omitted Person,

164
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,150
we have met before.

165
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,110
I felt it 20 years ago, too.

166
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,060
You are an evil soul,

167
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,980
a human's dark heart.

168
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,980
You take their evil energy and live off it.

169
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,060
I just change their black greed

170
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,280
to action.

171
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,330
If I covered their eyes...

172
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,510
Is that why you pushed me on that rooftop?

173
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,950
....or if they covered their eyes.

174
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,060
Stop all that nonsense.

175
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,710
What is your name?

176
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,360
Don't waste your time.

177
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,720
Even if you know my name, you won't be able to do anything to me.

178
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,070
Wouldn't that be the reason I am still here after 900 years?

179
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,070
Stop that nonsense...

180
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,280
and say your name.

181
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,830
Do you even know your name that you're asking for mine?

182
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,220
Should I tell you?

183
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,650
You still hold a lowly thing in your hands.

184
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,920
Seeing how you're holding onto her thinking she is precious,

185
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,240
even in this life, too,

186
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,720
she will die without fail.

187
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,690
Does he... know me?

188
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,880
- I thought you'd laugh.
- I thought you'd laugh.

189
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,080
I shouldn't laugh.

190
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,640
Ah! I shouldn't laugh though.

191
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
Hello?

192
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,120
Deok Hwa, it's me.

193
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,680
Hello?

194
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,410
It looks like this.

195
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,280
So the king... gave him this sword....

196
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,250
Seeing how you're not asking anything,

197
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
you must be on the Goblin's side.

198
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm sorry, but just once...

199
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,760
couldn't you be on my side?

200
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,880
What is it?

201
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,620
This... can you please give it to Sunny?

202
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,470
I thought there shouldn't even be such an excuse...

203
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,430
for me...

204
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,510
I will.

205
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,170
She will... probably not remember me.

206
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,920
The ring... make up an excuse for me.

207
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,180
I'm going.

208
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,170
But... I think she remembers...

209
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,240
Are you still waiting... for the king?

210
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,180
I can't wait now.

211
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,650
Why? Because you remember your past life?

212
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,290
Because the woman who loved the king...

213
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,590
is a traitor's sister.

214
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,000
That's why she died in that person's hands.

215
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,290
I keep getting confused.

216
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,010
The pain that is felt in the chest from the arrow

217
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,300
if it is me...

218
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,280
or if it was me from the past life.

219
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,510
I wonder if he was sad, too.

220
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,050
I only saw him turning his back.

221
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,150
He told me to cherish only happy moments...

222
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,370
but I must have liked all of it.

223
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,080
Seeing how I remember everything.

224
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,460
What about that person?

225
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Did you meet him?

226
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,860
It's all in the past. It's far away in the past since it's a lifetime ago.

227
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,150
For you, it's your past life,

228
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,650
but, for me, it's still my present life,

229
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,010
because I am living that life.

230
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,950
I have nowhere to retreat to,

231
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,670
so I can only go forward.

232
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,820
And he killed you.

233
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,420
He didn't kill me but he killed Kim Seon. Is is not me.

234
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,440
I am Sunny. My life...

235
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,830
is this lifetime.

236
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,640
But if you insist on going forward...

237
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,480
then as always, even crossing lifetimes,

238
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:21,700
my answer will be the same as then.

239
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,190
Go, Orabeoni.

240
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,790
This time, if I go forward,

241
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,680
what I intend to do to Yeo,

242
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,430
will not be forgiveness.

243
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,800
Don't worry about me.

244
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,020
In this lifetime,

245
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,880
I will really be happy, Orabeoni.

246
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,400
With this sword in his chest...

247
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,930
he lived 900 years.

248
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,310
That person...

249
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,480
We're the Grim Reaper Auditors Team.

250
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Have a seat.

251
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,200
While you were on duty,

252
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,060
we have confirmed that you used your abilities for personal reasons.

253
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,590
Aside from erasing a human's memory,

254
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,500
revealing a name card,

255
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,930
not reporting that your identity was revealed,

256
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,070
giving the memories of a past life back to a human being,

257
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,870
et cetera...

258
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,980
You two had a fight. You didn't see anything.

259
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,390
"I will be going first," say it.

260
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,090
I will be going first.

261
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,330
I will go first.

262
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,450
Can you please look at my eyes?

263
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,470
I'm sorry,

264
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,090
but can you please look at my eyes?

265
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,800
Miscellaneous Omitted Person's name card arrived.

266
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,560
A name card arrived.

267
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,880
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

268
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,300
There's something I didn't tell you. That I saw Sunny's past life.

269
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,360
-You said it was a secret..
- Sunny seems to be a reincarnation of your younger sister.

270
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,620
I am a grim reaper.

271
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,080
Do you acknowledge everything?

272
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,020
- I do.
- Now that you've acknowledged it,

273
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,710
we will impose a severe disciplinary action.

274
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,560
So face the severity of this matter.

275
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,250
I will accept the punishment.

276
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,520
It won't be so easy to accept.

277
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,270
Grim reapers are those who have

278
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,760
committed great sins in their past lives,

279
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,650
and while living through 200 years of hell,

280
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,910
they are those who chose to erase their memories.

281
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,740
Thus, you should face your sins again.

282
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,390
That is the punishment for all that you have violated.

283
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:49,820
Since you destroyed the band of traitors and showed them how robust you are,

284
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,770
the people are finally able to sleep well through the night,

285
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,620
so their praise of you has spread throughout the nation.

286
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,060
In case your mouth feels prickly, I ordered wine for you before the meal.

287
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,600
The scent is beautiful and with sweet and bitter flavors
 mixed together, it will give you an appetite.

288
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,450
People are worried that your mind and body are not well.

289
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,700
Starting tomorrow, decrease the King's food and present him with a tonic.

290
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:56,780
Please take it even if it's bitter and make your body and mind 
more clear so you can show your robust...

291
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,500
Is this... robust enough?

292
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,660
If ever one day you would be looking for this...

293
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,240
These silk clothes...

294
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,130
who should I put them on?

295
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,190
This beautiful jade ring, whose hand do I put it on?

296
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,340
This fine silk dress ...

297
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,780
who should I put them on? This beautiful jade ring...

298
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,140
whose hand should I put it on?

299
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,250
That beautiful jade ring...

300
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,010
give it to me.

301
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,940
That beautiful jade ring, give it to me.

302
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,960
I have a use for it.

303
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,120
Do you want to have it?

304
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,620
Fine.

305
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:22,300
Then I should give it to you. Have it.

306
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:49,720
The fine silk dress has no owner, it seems.

307
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,730
Perhaps...

308
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,690
are you looking for it?

309
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,970
Then...

310
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,990
take it.

311
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,080
Your Majesty, your tonic.

312
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:10,870
My people, my subjects,

313
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,760
my woman, too...

314
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,980
and even I myself... no one...

315
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:36,220
loved me. Till the end, from anyone,

316
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,300
I was not able to receive love.

317
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,920
Get more tonic.

318
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
I know what is in there.

319
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,880
Pardon?

320
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,410
Let's end it all at once.

321
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,330
The tonic... Bring me more.

322
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,980
It's an order.

323
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,340
Your sins from this world,

324
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,500
and within all your sins, the greatest sin, which is taking your own life,

325
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,250
and 600 years of hell,

326
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,570
you have received all of them back.

327
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,780
Thus, as your duties as a reaper are suspended,

328
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,660
be on standby until your next order is given.

329
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,170
I see I...

330
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,940
was Wang Yeo.

331
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,270
I...

332
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,880
killed them all.

333
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,370
I killed myself...

334
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,920
Kim Seon. Wang Yeo.

335
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,670
What are all your thoughts?

336
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,780
What should I do?

337
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,540
What should I do with him?

338
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:35,050
Don't touch this again. You have no right to look at this and cry.

339
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,240
I...

340
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,560
gave the sword... to you.

341
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,540
I killed...

342
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:59,840
I killed everyone. My memory returned.

343
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,140
I...

344
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,860
I was Wang Yeo.

345
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:26,100
That's right. It was you. You did it. You killed everyone! 
You killed and killed and then you...

346
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,270
even killed yourself.

347
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,380
You...  Your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo

348
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,050
and even yourself, you weren't able to protect any of them.

349
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,110
Seon... my young sister protected you with her life.

350
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,640
You should have lived! You should have remained alive to the end and died by my sword!

351
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,910
So that crime of treason that you put on me,

352
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,970
you should have given it proof with your death!

353
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,700
Yes.

354
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,750
My sister probably knew that when my name came out of Park Joong Hun's mouth,

355
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:06,500
the next would be her name. That it would make a myriad of excuses for you.

356
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,780
So that fool... rather than become your weakness,

357
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,140
on that spot, she died as the sister of a traitor,

358
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,750
to save you.

359
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,090
The ring...

360
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,680
That ring... I...

361
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,400
put it on her in such a cruel way.

362
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,860
In her hand... that ring...

363
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:47,020
came and went in this lifetime, too... I ask of you...

364
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,340
please...

365
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,670
kill me, please...

366
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,630
As expected,

367
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,570
you want to abandon yourself this time, too.

368
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:23,840
The sins you have committed... seem to be enough of a punishment for killing yourself...

369
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:46,380
I thought about it a lot, if it was right that I should give this to you.

370
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,670
So I had it for a couple of days. I'm sorry.

371
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,980
Why would you be? I'm the one who's sorry.

372
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,940
Aren't you going to ask more?

373
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,050
What about? I know it all.

374
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,380
Though... I didn't know I would be receiving it like this.

375
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:13,850
Someone's regret, guilt, and longing were all mine?

376
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,190
That shaman was quite skilled.

377
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,400
But then... what sin did you commit?

378
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,960
Huh?

379
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,530
You said you are my Goblin Orabeoni's bride. That person and I were lovers in the past...

380
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,300
But why are you entangled with my Orabeoni?

381
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,690
It's just fate.

382
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,880
Do you also do something strange? Do you perhaps fly? Like a bird?

383
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,470
I don't do those things.

384
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,880
An extinction tool to end the Goblin's immortality,

385
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,920
that is the Goblin bride's fate.

386
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,410
The moment you pull the sword out, he will scatter 

387
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,270
like dust in the wind. In this world ...

388
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,410
or to another world somewhere, forever.

389
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,680
Part-timer?

390
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,040
I... just can make it rain less,

391
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:23,740
so it isn't inconvenient for people. I can also make the first snow come sooner

392
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,820
to excite the world's people.

393
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,650
You do the most important work.

394
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,040
But, why did my brother become a goblin?

395
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,120
Because the world needs miracles

396
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,580
- that are weird and beautiful. 
 -Says who?

397
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
Me.

398
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,500
Okay. Then what about the Grim Reaper?

399
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,560
Because people all die in the end?

400
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,860
Since life is splendid because there is death.

401
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,350
Look how good you are with words. As expected of a university student.

402
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,260
Long time no see.

403
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:24,660
The lowly warrior's sister, a queen from a lowly military family...

404
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,210
Why? Is something there?

405
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:36,950
You stay out of it. It's not your turn yet. Yours is after that wench's.

406
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:41,630
Don't come close. Boss, get me the lighter from my coat, quickly!

407
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,200
Lighter? Why a lighter?

408
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,480
Yeo was like my son.

409
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,230
That wench ruined everything.

410
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,400
I will kill her.

411
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,550
- Boss, quickly! 
 - Alright.

412
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,860
This wench!

413
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,670
Part-timer! What's wrong? What? What is it?

414
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,730
Come to your senses! Part-timer!

415
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,580
Are you okay? Can you walk?

416
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,420
Yes, I'm fine. You must have been startled.

417
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,120
Of course, I was startled. Who were you talking to earlier?

418
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,480
That blue thing, that thing like light, what was that? You said you were human.

419
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,810
Perhaps, are you a human that isn't a human that is similar to a human?
 (referring to the song, "Some")

420
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,310
That was a first for me, too. Boss, you go inside first.

421
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:52,380
I'll come in after seeing your Orabeoni.

422
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,760
He's coming?

423
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,300
If I call him, he has no choice.

424
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,570
How are you?

425
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,250
I missed you.

426
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,940
Me, too.

427
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,900
Have you been well?

428
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,690
I'm sorry. I'll soon come to get you.

429
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,600
The mark on your neck...

430
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,120
Why?

431
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,660
It's almost invisible.

432
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,470
Is that so?

433
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,490
- I wonder why? 
 - The fact that it's this faded

434
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,700
means that I've put you in that much danger.
 And that I might not be able to sense you from now on.

435
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,590
Don't worry. I will be more cautions and careful.

436
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:13,480
Perhaps, did you see him again, Park Joong Hun?

437
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,790
I did but...

438
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:20,270
I wasn't his target.

439
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,200
My boss was his target.

440
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,980
That isn't something for you to worry about, either. Just worry about yourself

441
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,790
since someone else will protect my sister.

442
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,040
Just two more days.

443
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,850
 Fate is the question I throw. The answer...

444
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,820
you can find it.

445
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,540
We received a question,

446
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,820
and the Grim Reaper and I have to find the answer.

447
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,490
 [Park Joong Hun] 

448
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:13,430
 [Park Joong Hun, died in the 14th year of the sexagenary cycle, April.] 

449
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:18,170
[He did not respond to the call by the Grim Reaper and fled.]

450
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:22,440
 [I met the man again in 1997 

451
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:28,090
but he fled again and I was not able to capture him.] 

452
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,900
What is it about?

453
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,800
The papers for the Miscellaneous Omitted Person I told you about...

454
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,700
The one that got away 20 years ago?

455
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,180
But since I am on standby, I can't process it.

456
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,810
So you have to do it. Listen to me carefully.

457
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,980
- I'm listening. 
 - He's a soul that's been wandering around for 900 years

458
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,980
and feeding off of the dark emotions of humans. He has managed to stay alive until now.

459
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,930
Even if we come across him, it will be hard with just our own strength.

460
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:02,930
But if we put his name on the list, I think we can at least control him for now.

461
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,870
Please take care of it quickly. It is an urgent matter.

462
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,670
- By noon tomorrow-- 
- Today by midnight.

463
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,690
- Thank you. 
- I have something to say as well.

464
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:19,340
I thought you should know. I saw this when I was assigned to your area.

465
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,700
The name on the list, Ji Eun Tak,

466
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,750
this person, isn't she the Goblin's bride from before?

467
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,000
I saw the date, and--

468
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,290
Don't say it. Take your hand off the name card.

469
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,210
I looked at it. You don't know anything.

470
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,420
 [Ji Eun Tak] 

471
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,670
It's in a week...

472
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,340
 It's not your turn yet. Yours is after that wench's.

473
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,940
In the end...

474
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,190
is he saying that he's after me?

475
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,450
[Yoo Shin Woo]

476
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,000
Eun Tak's name card came.

477
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,890
- It must be... 
- Related to Park Joong Hun, right?

478
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:47,390
- In the 14th year--
 - That date has no meaning anymore.

479
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,850
- You know that. 
- But still...

480
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,920
I thought it would be good if you knew.

481
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,390
Park Joong Hun...

482
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,240
is lingering around my sister.

483
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,910
Protect her.

484
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:13,040
At least once protect my sister, like how my sister protected you.

485
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,890
That day...

486
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,180
the path to the king was too far...

487
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,130
and in the end I couldn't reach him.

488
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:34,050
Even though I knew I could not reach him ... even after knowing that... I could only go forward.

489
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:38,970
That day, for what did you keep on going forward?

490
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,900
When that place....

491
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:49,000
you knew all too well that it was going to be your grave.

492
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,840
To tell you what I wasn't able to before.

493
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,750
After I received the sword,

494
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:11,930
I asked to see you countless times, but the king who was also my brother-in-law

495
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,100
only ordered for me to travel west-by-southwest.

496
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,610
Only when you were sure that I would die, you showed your face.

497
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,340
So...

498
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,650
by going that far.... what did you want to say?

499
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,640
- The former king--
- By not taking care of him

500
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,600
I took care of him, tell him that.

501
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,790
He took care of you by not caring for you.

502
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,150
From the late king who was your half-brother,

503
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:45,990
from your lover who was my sister, from me who protected your Goryeo,

504
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,010
that you received love.

505
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:02,700
And to tell you just one thing, "Since I will lay down this sword filled with rage and apprehension,

506
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:06,900
so behead Park Joong Hun."

507
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,470
Just that one thing...

508
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,960
But that sword...

509
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,890
I didn't know would be in my chest, instead.

510
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,320
How could it...?

511
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,420
 It's been 900 years for you and I both. 

512
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,830
 You can't kill me with a mere sword.

513
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,750
I came this far....

514
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,400
but I end up holding this sword again.

515
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,620
What's wrong?

516
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:20,960
Is the sword hurting again?

517
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,090
The purpose of this sword, in the end...

518
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,910
was that.

519
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:42,040
To take out Park Joong Hun.

520
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,930
Are you an engineer?

521
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:17,840
The final point to a phone number... are the lips.

522
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,600
 ♫ When I look at you  ♫ 

523
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,290
 ♫ I don't know why My tears keep falling ♫ 

524
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:34,080
I'm going crazy, seriously.

525
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,260
You need to look pretty. Stop crying.

526
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:45,520
♫ Were you coming back to me? ♫

527
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:51,630
♫  This love which can't be avoided♫

528
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:59,220
♫  I love you, love you, love you ♫

529
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:06,900
♫ I could feel that we are fated to be ♫

530
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:14,370
♫ And I miss you, miss you ♫

531
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:20,240
♫   You are my fated person ♫

532
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,880
♫  Why do you look at me with those sad eyes? ♫

533
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,030
♫  Why do you look at me with those sad eyes? ♫

534
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:45,250
♫Don’t cry  ♫

535
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:53,000
♫ Didn't you recognize me at first glance? ♫

536
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,590
- Why do you keep following me?
 ♫ Why didn't you come to me til now? ♫

537
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,640
It's been a few days already. Are you a stalker?

538
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,820
♫ I love you, love you, love you > ♫

539
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,350
It's nothing like that.

540
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,280
I think our paths just cross by chance...

541
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,100
Thanks to you, it felt like I was having a date

542
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,290
with Mr. Kim Woo Bin.

543
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:20,180
♫ And I miss you, miss you ♫

544
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:24,090
Exactly why?

545
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,650
How could you remember?

546
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:32,080
Because you put the wrong spell on me.

547
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,400
The hard and sad moments... forget them.

548
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,790
Be it the past life or the present life.

549
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:50,160
And also... forget me, too. 
 ♫ Don't leave my side. ♫

550
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,970
And in this way... I hope that at least you will have a happy ending.

551
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:05,990
 ♫ Don’t leave my side ♫ 

552
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:13,880
Asking me to forget you after telling me to forget everything
 except for happy moments... It doesn't make sense.

553
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,040
All the moments that you were in... even the sad and hard moments, everything...

554
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,840
Even those moments, I liked them all.

555
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:32,530
So... protecting you with my death... did it become a happy ending for you?

556
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:40,610
Looking at how young you look now, it seems like you weren't able to live long.

557
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:47,990
Every day... with bitter regret...

558
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,650
I longed for you.

559
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,680
Then why, if you were going to do that?

560
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,660
Because I was foolish.

561
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,830
I wish you had realized it sooner.

562
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,180
But how did I...

563
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:19,200
even in this lifetime, too, fall for you?

564
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,020
Maybe because your royal face is so bright?

565
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,590
Here.

566
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:37,650
Let's really break up.

567
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,250
I won't fall for you in this lifetime...

568
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,800
The punishment that I can give you... is only this.

569
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:58,570
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

570
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:21,640
Give it to me!

571
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,470
You don't even have money, so how did you get snacks? Did you steal?

572
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,120
No! My grandmother bought it for me!

573
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,300
Did she get it by begging?

574
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,510
Don't put my grandmother down! Gust of wind!

575
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:33,350
He's doing this again. Seriously...

576
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:37,560
Hey! That's not how you do gust of wind. You do it like this.

577
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,460
Gust of wind!

578
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,970
Gust of wind!

579
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,550
Hey, you rascals, again!

580
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:49,580
Gust of wind!

581
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,750
What? It was real?

582
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,550
Are you okay?

583
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,340
Noona, how did you know?

584
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,780
You said to me last time that I would be able to shoot a real gust of wind.

585
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,170
I really shot it! Gust of wind!

586
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:21,490
When I was your age, I also thought how I should become a Goblin's bride

587
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:24,650
and I really became one.

588
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:30,220
But it's a secret. Gusty winds and such are very dangerous so you can't just shoot it anywhere.

589
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,980
Understand?

590
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,420
I will tell just my grandmother.

591
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,680
That's pretty cool.

592
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,000
If it's cool then let's go on a trip.

593
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,410
- Wow!
- Why?

594
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:52,760
My heart just dropped.

595
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,760
That's good. You said you liked that.

596
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,870
You seem to be in a good mood.

597
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,740
Let's do that. Let's go on a trip.

598
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:10,410
 ♫ Through the endless daydream  ♫ 

599
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:14,300
 ♫ I saw you on the way back ♫ 

600
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:20,750
 ♫ There I walk with you in my arms ♫ 

601
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,080
 ♫ Through the blurry ♫ 

602
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,180
- Mister. 
  ♫ Darkness ♫ 

603
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,060
 ♫ Who's veiling on the twilight ♫ 

604
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:34,820
 ♫ We've been far away from my fears ♫ 

605
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,760
 ♫ Somewhere else I'll see you ♫ 

606
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,840
♬  Our days be like a blossom   ♬

607
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:49,670
♬   Blooming all around you, so bright ♬

608
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:58,640
♬   All around me is your light. With you everything so shines    ♬

609
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,640
- It's nice.
 ♬  How come we’ll leave all behind?   ♬Cause your love is falling on my heart

610
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,610
- It's nice.
 ♬  How come we’ll leave all behind?   ♬Cause your love is falling on my heart

611
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:12,030
♬   And I’m falling for you... Falling with broken wings again   ♬

612
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:21,780
♬  Hush now, my angel.  I will always be with you   ♬

613
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,060
♬  In your pretty smile, in a glow of tears    ♬

614
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:31,030
- I have a gift.
 ♬ Out across the frosty night, I’ll be there with you ♬

615
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:35,720
This is enough. This is already perfect enough.

616
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,110
♬   Maybe you‘ll always breath in me    ♬

617
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,060
I bet not.

618
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:46,230
Oh! This.

619
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:51,510
Now that you are an adult, remember. Usually each person gets one.

620
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,250
So that's why I forged it,

621
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,470
but then I got caught.

622
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,150
But which one is the original?

623
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,770
So it's that one?

624
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:08,160
- Give me that.
- I don't want to.

625
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:12,360
I want to have that!

626
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:46,760
B grants A's wish every year on the first snow,

627
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,210
because A would be waiting.

628
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:54,000
Awesome!

629
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,650
It's snowing.

630
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,890
It's the first snow, Mister!

631
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,670
Do you think I should be sad for a thousand years?

632
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,210
Do you think I'm in pain every day?

633
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,940
I'm just an energetic goblin who humbly accepts his fate and lives cheerfully..

634
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:23,250
Now I am a strong Goblin's bride who's living her life bravely while accepting her fate.

635
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,420
Where would you find sadness that goes on for thousands of years?

636
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,820
Where would you find a love that goes on for thousands of years?

637
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,720
I give one vote that there is one.

638
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,560
Which side are you going to put it on? On sadness or love?

639
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,400
A permission that's like an excuse ...

640
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,770
I wish I had it.

641
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:55,070
With that excuse... I wish I could continue to live

642
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,560
with you.

643
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,090
Sad love.

Welcome, customers.

You must be here to look for a bed.

651

You have good taste. To tell you about this bed...

652
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,750
If you lie down, you would fall asleep right away.

653
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,950
Mr. Yoo Deok Hwa...get up immediately!

Go ahead.

677

It concerns Park Joong Hun.

678
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:42,390
I had already been thinking about that, and I was curious.

679
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:49,320
Why did he have to appear now? He was wandering for 900 years, so why would he appear now?

680
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,000
That...

I am the Goblin's bride.

Listen well. I will be calling in a few moments.

Summon me right away at that moment.

you can't take me out with a mere sword made from water.

693
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:52,910
I know that.

694
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:56,560
So should we go to our last battle?

695
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,670
How do you know where I will be going?

696
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:36,690
But buckwheat flowers... what do they mean?

697
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:38,450
Lovers.

698
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:17,410

It was because of me.

702
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:03,140
He was waiting for my mark to disappear...

703
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:05,500
Impressive.

704
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,880
However, it's too late.

705
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,020
By using me...

706
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:16,440
he plans to take the sword out.

707
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,800
It's now. Summon me.

708
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,620
Don't be resentful.

709
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,100
This is your fate.

710
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:01,680
Are you alright?

711
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,940
Ji Eun Tak!

712
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:17,720
I found out. I found out the reason why he appeared now.

713
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,100
Strike me. Hurry.

714
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,960
It will be the end if he goes into my body. He's trying to use my hands to take the sword out!

715
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,850
If not for you... I was fated to die anyway...

716
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:31,820
Hurry up and strike me!

717
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,970
What this child said was right. You should have killed her.

718
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,190
Now it's either you die or I die.

719
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,400
But because you keep looking back...

720
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:50,990
I guess you will die by my hands.

721
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,320
Park Joong Hun,

722
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:21,960

So I go like this.

726
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:49,740
However, it is not for naught since I killed you again.

Look.

728

In the end... it is destruction.

Please forgive me.

730
