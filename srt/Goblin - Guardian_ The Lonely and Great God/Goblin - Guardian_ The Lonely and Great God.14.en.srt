00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,930
Please forgive me.

5
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,290
Only now am I able to notify you

00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,090
of my dying a heroic death.

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,250

No... No... You can't!

15
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,970
Meeting you in my life...

16
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,030
was a reward.

17
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,690
No, I don't want this... Please ...

18
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,030
You said you wouldn't let go of my hand.

19
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,750
You promised.

20
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,050
I will come as rain...

21
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,030
I will come as the first snow.

22
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,900
So that I could at least do that...

23
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,510
I will beg God.

24
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:01,790
Don't...! Don't go like that!

25
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,570
I love you...

26
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,920
I love you. I love you.

27
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,660
I do, too.

28
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,750
I love you.

29
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
Even that...

30
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,600
I already did so.

[It was first love.]

39
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,890
Remember, you have to remember.

40
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:19,420
That person's name is Kim Shin.

41
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:26,390
He's tall and he looks sad when he smiles.

42
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:34,130
He will come as rain. He will come as the first snow. He will keep his promise.

43
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,230
Remember. You have to remember.

44
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,970
I am that person's bride.

45
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,180
God said:

46
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,020
You have been erased from the memory of everyone who knew you.

47
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,760
That is for their peace and my consideration.

48
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,110
And also,  your punishment has ended.

49
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,400
Now, you can forget everything and be at peace.

50
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,740
However, there were tears in the Goblin's eyes.

51
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:29,030
Now, I understand what choice I made.

52
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:35,180
In the end, I... made that decision.

53
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,290
I will stay In this place.

54
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,200
I will stay in this place and go as the rain.

55
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,800
I will go as the wind. I will go as the first snow.

56
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,770
Just that...

57
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,100
Just that...

58
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,690
I ask for heaven's permission.

59
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,630
It was a foolish choice to make.

60
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,840
I was always with you in your life.

61
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,240
However,  I am no longer in this place.

62
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,820
Just like that, the lone Goblin, in between this life and the afterlife,

63
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,760
in between light and darkness, in the place where even God had left,

64
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,540
is stuck there for eternity.

65
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,630
Ahh... What to do?

66
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,710
And so? What happened to the Goblin?

67
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,030
I'm not sure. His memories will soon be forgotten

68
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:29,660
and he will just be left in that great futility. In that futility, he will walk and walk again.

69
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:38,390
As he walks on... what will happen? Where will he go?

70
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,400
It's such a sad story.

71
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,880
How much is this?

72
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,890
[Nine years later]

73
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,600
A sensible weekend...

74
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,190
May you have a sensible weekend.

75
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,510
Ten minutes before going live.

76
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,410
PD (Program Director, Producer), here.

77
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
PD Ji, it's raining.

78
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,330
It's getting harder.

79
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,740
Are we in South East Asia?

80
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,780
What's with the weather forecast? They said it was going to be blindingly bright.

81
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,360
- I know. I don't even have an umbrella.
- Is an umbrella the problem now?

82
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,950
- What are we going to do about the opening?
- Do what?

83
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,720
We can't make the rain stop so we should just write it again.

84
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,210
We can use today's on a clear day. Keep it. For now, the first song is okay.

85
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,470
The gloomier the day gets we should go with a bright start.

86
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,550
Just with the comment about the weather not matching...

87
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,240
I am writing it again.

88
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,050
Oh, my fate.

89
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,540
Eight minutes before going live.

90
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,520
Just $300. It's urgent. Reply to me.

91
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,810
I'm going to go select songs.

92
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,620
Mister, who are you?

93
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,010
Did I see wrongly?

94
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,060
Well...

95
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,430
It was 20 years ago.

96
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,290
Did this belong to Mom?

97
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,850
Since when did I have...

98
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,000
this necklace?

99
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,180
In that desert,

100
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,930
he was so lonely.

101
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,380
Sometimes he walked backwards

102
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,350
to see the footsteps in front of him.

103
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,090
How...

104
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,290
did it just burn in this spot?

105
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,280
Welcome.

106
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,660
Boss, you're pretty as always.

107
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,900
Please give me soju.

108
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,190
The broadcast today was good, so why? Did the CP (Chief Producer) make a fuss again?

109
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,420
What's the point of it being good? I'm about to get fired because ads are not coming in.

110
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,290
And it suddenly rained so it was crazy.

111
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,860
Ah, for the snack, half-half.

112
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,660
Half-half!

113
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,340
Just go and get soju yourself.

114
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,480
To a customer.

115
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,030
Oh, class president! Over there.

116
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,010
Until when is she the class president? Will she continue being the class president?

117
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,830
Lawyer Kim, welcome. For the snacks, PD Ji has already ordered.

118
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,310
Beer for me.

119
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,230
Did you win the lawsuit?

120
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,720
I wouldn't be able to get off work if I lost.

121
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
Don't you want to go on a blind date?

122
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,020
- I don't like lawyers. 
- This time, it's a chef.

123
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,950
He comes out on cooking shows often,

124
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,600
and he looks like a puppy when he smiles. He's cute.

125
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,660
- He's your taste, so why would I? 
- He's an avid listener to your program, so why would I?

126
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,740
He always has your program on at his restaurant for lunch hour.

127
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,220
Am I the only friend you have to sell?

128
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,100
Go while she's selling you.

129
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,360
Look at me. Being someone's first love

130
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,540
was the easiest thing for me.

131
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,050
But I don't even have a man that asks me out for coffee anymore.

132
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,500
Right. Let's not become like her.

133
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,430
Lawyer Kim, what do you mean?

134
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,340
It was suitable to help Ji Eun Tak understand. Why?

135
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,020
PD Ji, is she your only friend?

136
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,260
Is this the only place you go to drink?

137
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,220
Rain is falling,

138
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,560
and the alcohol is bitter.

139
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,820
And I have two friends that worry over me.

140
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,560
The day is so nice.

141
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,570
I heard she's the Goblin's bride, but why can't she see us?

142
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,650
She was a Goblin's bride in the old days.

143
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,310
Seeing how the Goblin has not appeared now that she's 29 years old...

144
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,750
Honestly, she's no different from a widow.

145
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,670
Then again, she could see me before.

146
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,070
Why am I like this?

147
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,780
Why am I so sad?

148
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,770
Why am I always like this?

149
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,520
Woah! It's the first snow.

150
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,580
I know. This year it's way too early.

151
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,560
But still, it's nice to have the first snow, right?

152
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,680
What did I forget?

153
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,840
Who...

154
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,730
did I forget?

155
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,400
What face did I forget?

156
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,600
What promise did I forget

157
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,830
that only a sadness with unknown depth is left?

158
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,410
Someone please...

159
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:58,900
anyone... please...

160
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,310

♫ I did not know before I embraced you in my arms ♫

166
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:11,770
♫ That the world I remained in is glorious♫

167
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:18,090
♫ Reached by a person with a small breath ♫

168
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,170
♫ The love that called me without fear ♫

169
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,550
Me?

170
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,900
Yeah, you. Was it you?

171
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,070
♫ Watching over you and being excited♫

172
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,240
♫  I was ridiculously jealous♫

173
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,650
Don't! Don't go like that! 
 ♫ All ordinary moments  ♫

174
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,770
I love you. I love you. 
♫ A dark eternity,  into that long wait ♫

175
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:52,420
♫ You fell like the sunshine ♫

176
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,520
♫ I did not know before I let you go ♫

177
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:23,430
♫ The world I remained in was desolate ♫

178
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:29,660
♫ This place where beautiful flowers will bloom  ♫

179
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:36,470
♫ The season that you will never be again ♫

180
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:43,770
♫ I was greedy, to livie and grow old with you ♫

181
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:51,150
♫ Holding the wrinkled hand, saying my life was warm ♫

182
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,960
♫ Only once blessed ♫

183
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm sorry. I'm just so emotional. I'm sorry. 
♫ Did the wish wanting to be happy once ♫

184
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,460
♫  make you cry? ♫

185
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:11,030
- What am I doing? 
 ♫ I’ll find you ♫

186
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,530
Oh, why am I the one apologizing?

187
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:23,320
What are you doing right now? Why did you hug me? Do you know me? Who are you?

188
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,650
I'm B (on the contract).

189
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,530
B?

190
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,830
Are you an actor by any chance? The drama department is...

191
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,210
Did you achieve your dream?

192
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,940
What are you talking about?

193
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,410
I'm so proud amidst all that.

194
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:56,080
Yes, well... thank you. But why did you hug me just now?

195
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,480
And also, why do you keep on speaking informally?

196
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,700
You are erased from the memory of everyone who knew you.

197
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,690
That is for their peace and my consideration.

198
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,160
It's enough that you are at peace. That's enough.

199
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,170
Are you acting or what?

200
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,860
The drama department is not in this building but you have to go to that annex behind you.

201
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,160
But how did you get in here without a pass?

202
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,240
Because someone called.

203
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,480
Ah.

204
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,920
- Mr. Deok Hwa.
- Go ahead.

205
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,540
I am the CEO and you are still the team leader. Go to your position.

206
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,250
I thought that was natural.

207
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,120
Deok Hwa.

208
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,870
You can't come in here. I'm sorry.

209
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,830
Just now... that person called me right? "Deok Hwa."

210
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,120
- Deok Hwa.
- Please go out.

211
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,260
Let him be. Let's hear him out.

212
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,500
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you again. It's good to see you like this.

213
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,960
Just talk from over there. From there.

214
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,530
Who are you? Do you know me?

215
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,420
I was your uncle and your brother...

216
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,470
It's a crazy person?

217
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,250
I am not a crazy person.

218
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,810
I am hungry. Let's go. What will you have?

219
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,270
I already made reservations in the place that you like.

220
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,020
Deok Hwa.

221
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,090
No matter how I think about it, it's strange. He clearly said he was Uncle...

222
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,650
Uncle's existence is the top secret of Cheon Woo Group. 
In South Korea, it's a secret only Grandpa and I know about.

223
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,930
Then one more person just got added to it.

224
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,490
Who?

225
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:48,210
That... is the name of your uncle perhaps Kim Shin?

226
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,370
CEO Kim, why would my uncle's last name be Kim? It's got to be Yoo.

227
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,290
- Who is Kim Shin?
- Eat.

228
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:02,600
Birth secret... for a third generation conglomerate heir this kind of tragic...

229
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,980
CEO Kim, don't worry. How did I work myself up from the bottom? How many years have I been eating seolleongtang (beef bone stew) for lunch?

230
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,600
I'll eat this and protect my company, just like a chaebol.

231
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,160
Mr. Deok Hwa, it's not your company...

232
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,690
It's the company of all the employees. Since those people are
 protecting the company well, lay low on the excessive energy.

233
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,260
Lunch time is over. Thank you for lunch.

234
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,040
I'm still ...

235
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,360
Here's your gift set.

236
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,290
Yes.

237
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,800
Thank you.

238
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,700
Enjoy the food.

239
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,110
Over here!

240
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,370
Yes.

241
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,460
Just a moment.

242
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,120
I could not recognize you .

243
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,390
even though you were next to me.  You are Wang Yeo.

244
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:51,590
You, your woman, your loyal subjects, your Goryeo and
 even yourself... you were not able to protect any of them.

245
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:58,260
The purpose of this sword in the end was that,

246
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,940
to kill Park Joong Hun.

247
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,530
Please forgive me.  Dying an heroic death...

248
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,740
Only now... I am able to notify you.

249
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,180
What a crass hat he's wearing. Like always.

250
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,270
Are you the Goblin that was rumored to have gone back to nothingness?

251
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,120
The rumors of my demise are greatly exaggerated.

252
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:44,510
I guess you didn't scatter as dust or wind or rain.

253
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,740
Of course... you also did not become a radish that could  be eaten. (wordplay on nothingness)

254
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,870
What happened?

255
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,360
Your memory...

256
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,330
I thought you wouldn't remember. Everything should have gone back to nothing.

257
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,290
It happened to everyone. But my memory was sound.

258
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,840
I don't know well...

259
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,000
but I have a hunch.

260
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,690
I will stand on the same side as Uncle down the hall to the very end. I swear.

261
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,130
That time I was weak-hearted, for real.

262
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,820
If you are going to be on his side then just leave Yeo's memory.

263
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,220
Why?

264
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,120
It's too sad for Shin and Tak. One world closed.

265
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,960
I think at least one that's not one of us should remember that love's whole history.

266
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:59,290
But then you see... why does it seem like I discovered the door that would open that world?

267
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,300
Did I not close it tight enough?

268
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:14,120
What happened to you? How did you come here again?

269
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,340
Because of A's tyranny.

270
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,090
Welcome back.

271
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,130
Really... welcome back.

272
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,980
It's nice that you're welcoming me.

273
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,840
Even though it shouldn't be.

274
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,210
Although it's too late...

275
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,850
Even though it's very late, I should have done this 9 years ago,
 I should have done this 900 years ago...

276
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:53,720
The words I am saying now... I hope you will forgive me.

277
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:02,230
You who have protected my lover and my Goryeo...

278
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,970
Forgive me for the sin of not being able to protect you. I was loved...

279
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,430
but for the sin of not loving anyone... forgive me.

280
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,990
I should say this first...

281
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,170
I'm finally back my home.

282
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,550
It's my house. I still have 10 years on my lease.

283
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,410
What about my sister?

284
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,490
I haven't seen her in 9 years.

285
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:19,520
Longing for her is my punishment. Because anyway, I'm forever a sinner.

286
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,590
What about Miscellaneous Omitted Person? Have you seen her?

287
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,590
Yes.

288
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,260
She doesn't remember, right?

289
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,580
Yes. She became a Radio PD.

290
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,390
I was happy.

291
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,290
I sometimes listen to it.

292
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,100
Let me know, too, so I can listen.

293
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,880
Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa!

294
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,940
Hide quickly. Here, Here!

295
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,950
Uncle down the hall.

296
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,570
Yes. You came? What is it?

297
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,220
I met a strange person at the company, so my mind feels confused.

298
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,560
I wanted to see if you were doing well.

299
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,040
- But Uncle down the hall? 
-Yes?

300
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,640
If you were my uncle, you'd be "Uncle." But why is Uncle,  "Uncle down the hall?"

301
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,860
Come to think of it, since when did Uncle down the hall live in our house?

302
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,860
You'll know if you look at the real estate contract.

303
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,210
Ah. But why is there two bottles of alcohol? Did someone come?

304
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,140
I prefer to drink with one bottle in each hand.

305
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,530
So... who is the owner of the feet  behind the sofa?

306
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,870
Yah, this sofa is really pretty. The owner has good taste.

307
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,060
I like the finishing.

308
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,870
Oh! That strange...  that weird... did you get your hair done?

309
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:59,870
My hair turned out well. I am his friend, to play in this house.

310
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,590
He's leaving. He was just about to go.

311
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,620
I had a good time. Go.

312
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,110
Yes. Okay.

313
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,410
Go.

314
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,360
- Nice meeting you. 
 - Yes.

315
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,960
You are wearing such bad clothes.

316
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,510
What? Is Uncle down the hall a part of my birth secret?

317
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,210
Did you hear something on the second floor just now?

318
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,330
- I didn't.
 - I did.

319
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,820
- I didn't. 
- I'm sure! I did.

320
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,090
You did not. Deok Hwa! Deok Hwa! Will you look in my eyes for a bit?

321
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,880
 The weather has fallen to 22℃  and it's getting very chilly. 

322
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,660
 I will play the last song. Be careful of the cold. (Don't get a cold).

323
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,560
What to do? She said 22℃ instead of 2℃.

324
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,170
I... wrote it wrong. It really shows, not having the writer for one day.

325
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,090
The CP (Chief Producer) is coming. Ah!

326
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,150
Don't worry. I'll take responsibility.

327
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:39,180
22℃? "The weather has fallen to 22℃, so it's very chilly."

328
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,160
"Be careful of the cold." Does this make sense, huh?

329
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm sorry.

330
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,680
PD Ji, are you dating? Is it spring in your heart? With the way things are going the flowers are going to blossom!

331
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm sorry.

332
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,070
Wow! What is this?

333
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:58,730
PD Ji, are you some sort of magician? It's all over SNS.

334
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:03,610
In front of our broadcasting station. Right now, the temperature is exactly 22℃.

335
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,120
The flowers have bloomed in winter.

336
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:22,060
♬ Mysterious light, I’m still discovering  ♬

337
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:32,080
♬ How can I get over you?  ♬

338
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:41,640
♬ Why do we have to be  ♬

339
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,460
♬ Apart? ♬

340
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:56,230
♬ And I’m wondering if you know why, know why  ♬

341
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,420
♬ And I’m wondering if you ♬

342
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,750
 Today, in the area of Seongnam-dong, the temperature soared to 22℃ (72℉).

343
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,690
 The last time the temperature was like this was 9 years ago.

344
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,830
 The cherry blossoms in full bloom have caught the attention of the citizens.

345
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,170
What is this really? It's so fascinating, isn't it?

346
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,470
Does this even make sense?

347
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,680
During the reorganization time, our number of listeners fell down a lot.

348
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,120
So before the reorganization, let's break the mood and keep our existing listeners hooked.

349
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,920
Yes, I get it. I will send you the plan for reorganization, so take a look.

350
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,080
Who in the world is that guy?

351
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,240
Ah, what's wrong with me?

352
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,200
The medicine only works just for a little while. I mean...

353
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,790
- What exactly was that? 
 - What do you mean?

354
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,550
Why are you sitting there?

355
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,310
- Because someone called me. 
- That's your problem.

356
00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:26,370
I'm not sharing this table.

357
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,670
That person... did she not come?

358
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,460
She came.

359
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:41,800
She came, but she doesn't recognize me.

360
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:50,250
Okay. I heard the story, but I feel uncomfortable because I have someone I'm meeting.

361
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,540
My boyfriend is coming.

362
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,970
I looks like you don't have a boyfriend.

363
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:57,050
Was the e-mail sent well? It's urgent.

364
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:02,050
You had a haircut. I almost didn't recognize you.

365
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:05,130
- You still don't recognize me. 
- I did.

366
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,090
But.... you were there earlier, weren't you?

367
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,310
I tend to be everywhere and nowhere.

368
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,070
Earlier, in front of the broadcasting station, when the temperature was 22℃.

369
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,430
I went to see someone.

370
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,860
I missed her. Very much.

371
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,420
When I see her, it seems like she would run in my arms.

372
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:37,350
But because I know that those things won't happen, my heart is hurting.

373
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,150
But why are you telling that story to me?

374
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,430
You asked.

375
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,310
Aren't you going to order anything?

376
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,440
Enjoy your drink.

377
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,550
Seriously,

378
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,880
how do you not have 5000 won... Why are you at a café?

379
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,160
Oh, that's because... my wallet is in my coat, but I was called out before I could pick up my coat.

380
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,780
I'm sorry. I'll drink it well. I'll pay off this debt next time for sure—

381
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,620
There will be no next time. Which way are you going?

382
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,060
Ah, this way.

383
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,820
She should have stayed just a little longer.

384
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:33,660
Could I just have 5,000 won? ($5) So I could pay her back?

385
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,880
Close the door!

386
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,100
How am I supposed to fix this?

387
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,770
I need only 10, 000 won to buy a book.

388
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,220
How long has it been since the service guy's supposed to come?

389
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:13,690
Could I just have 100,000 won? ($100) So I could buy some meat?

390
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:15,880
Please?

391
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,670
I'm sure God had a plan to leave your memory with me.

392
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,450
Since you talk to me like that, it makes me feel very awkward. I guess I have to use my last resort.

393
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,870
Don't think of the past and make gold bars appear.

394
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,120
They all have serial numbers so you won't be able to sell them.

395
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,390
So confusing. Then is that the only way?

396
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,120
What?

397
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:52,030
Our security's supposed to be the top. It's very safe. But how did you? Who are you?

398
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:57,630
I am... water, fire, light and dark.

399
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,850
To you, I'm Yoo Shin Jae, and Kim Shin to you.

400
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:06,280
Are you the uncle that Grandpa talked about?

401
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,170
That person in Chairman's will.

402
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,280
In Grandpa's will?

403
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,680
It's the Chairman's will and the will that's been handed down from  your ancestor's ancestors.

404
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,810
One day, if a person who has a surname Kim and name Shin that means trustworthy, comes

405
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,760
and says that he's here for his things, give them to him.

406
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,840
Everything I have left belongs to him.

407
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,890
He will come walking in the rain and go in a blue flame.

408
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,960
Then know he's Kim Shin.

409
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,480
It's a night I miss Chairman Yoo.

410
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:49,890
I don't need the company. Yoo family carved up the company so it cannot be not yours, Deok Hwa.

411
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,780
But I need my house, identity, credit card, and nephew.

412
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,690
Following the Chairman's will, I will prepare the house, identity, and credit card.

413
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,870
- The nephew is you. 
 - Umm, but...

414
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,480
If you haven't realized, then it's okay.

415
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,500
What do you mean?

416
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,790
Ji Eun Tak!

417
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:20,800
How did you answer the phone call?
 Because of your response, the listeners' BBS is going crazy!

418
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,050
I sent the chef's knife set as the prize,

419
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,950
but he kept on calling to exchange it to a clothing shop gift card,
 that the writers couldn't work. What was I supposed to do, then?

420
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,540
It's not like we're a clothing company.

421
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,190
Then what are you going to do with the clothing company? Do we pay your check from a money tree?

422
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:40,160
Both the clothing company and the knife company are pulling their ads. What are you going to do?

423
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,460
You take responsibility to get sponsors and ads

424
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,100
and make up for it. If you don't, you'll be fired!

425
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,960
- Manager! 
 - What?

426
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,850
I will try my best. This is not easy, but I will do it.

427
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,090
That-That... bi....

428
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,110
I got a confession from Sang Hyeon today!

429
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:34,930
Really?

430
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,640
From the pretty Sang Hyeon in the next classroom.

431
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,150
Hurry and reply!

432
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,470
Good times.

433
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,850
Why are you smiling?

434
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,430
It's because I find it cute.

435
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,420
I know.

436
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,220
Not them.

437
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,720
But then... aren't you going to give me my 5,000 won?

438
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,850
If I don't give it, perhaps will we see each other again? Do you want it now?

439
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:12,270
I have to go and get it. Payment. You know what I mean, right?

440
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,290
I don't.

441
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,790
If there is a next time, it means I will be reporting it to the police.

442
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:20,960
I don't know why we keep crossing paths.

443
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,950
Why are you smiling this time?

444
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,590
Because it feels good.

445
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,740
Because I can't believe this moment.

446
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,500
Everything is perfect.

447
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,250
What is this? Avoiding is just common sense. Which direction are you going?

448
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,780
You're going again.

449
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,420
I will listen to the broadcast well. I'm always listening.

450
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,310
How did you know I work in broadcasting?

451
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,640
It's a bit suspicious at this point. I thought you were an actor last time.

452
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,880
You're not an actor, are you?

453
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,760
I'm sorry but what do you do?

454
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,760
So... that...

455
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,400
Over there... that company.

456
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,140
That  furniture company? What work do you do there?

457
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,360
That is... that... the highest person?

458
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,000
Excuse me.

459
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,930
Earlier, you were looking at that company's documents. 
Give it to me. Those were for ads, right?

460
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,000
Give it to me. I will prove to you that I am the highest person in that company.

461
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,480
Originally the staff would be the one to sign this, but the CEO asked me especially.

462
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,490
So that person is the CEO.

463
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,030
Does he work here in the main branch?

464
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,000
He doesn't go to work.

465
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,620
Then how should I relay my thanks to him...

466
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,340
To be honest, I don't know his number.

467
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,420
But then, he asked me to sign this kind of document?

468
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,180
Why is that?

469
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,550
So... why would it be?

470
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,720
Then, will you please leave your contact information? Then I will give it to him.

471
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,500
Thank you.

472
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:14,100
But then... that person's name... I'm a bit strange, right?

473
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,720
It would be if you would get entangled with that person.

474
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,940
His surname is Yoo and his name is Shin Jae.

475
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,990
Yes. Thank you.

476
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,750
PD Ji! PD Ji!

477
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,830
So cool!

478
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,780
What happened? How did you get an ad?

479
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:38,120
I don't know. It feels like I was under a spell and it seems like a miracle.

480
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,980
Aside from that, I can't explain it.

481
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:46,290
It doesn't matter how. What matters is our program is saved.

482
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,810
You're the best, PD!

483
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:54,430
Now, now. In front of this good energy, let's do well on this new item.

484
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,670
I am looking for a person.

485
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,340
I am looking for a person whose picture is in my phone for 10 years. I am looking for that person I broke up with.

486
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,010
I am looking for the forgotten face and the forgotten memories.

487
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:08,600
If you send in your story, we will introduce the story and get you connected to that person.

488
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,280
It's good.

489
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,310
First, look for a picture in your phones and we will have a meeting next.

490
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:19,340
Sincerity, you know? Sincerity. I know at once when I see the story.

491
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,090
Right. Writer Oh knows right away. Work hard.

492
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,550
Yes.

493
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,910
Whose call are you waiting for?

494
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,040
It's not coming.

495
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:51,380
Nice plan. I should find my first love this time.

496
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,830
You should look for that person, Kim Shin.

497
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,570
Should I?

498
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:04,600
But then, that... Is that really your handwriting?

499
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,760
I told you. That's why it's strange.

500
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,620
Is it not a ghost? You used to see ghosts in high school.

501
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,930
About 9 years? 10 years?

502
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:20,610
I haven't seen them and now I started to see them again.

503
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,310
Behind your back right now!

504
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,370
Hey!

505
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,050
I'm asking for the napkin.

506
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,390
You're going to die! Really!

507
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,920
What exactly are you?

508
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,060
Why am I your bride?

509
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,610
You are that person's bride.

510
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,590
Who are you?

511
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,500
Uncle!

512
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,300
Ji Eun Tak, Le Chateau Frontenac, Quebec, Quebec, Canada

513
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,590
This came to the address on the first floor of the building that I own.

514
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm not sure about an English letter.

515
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,980
It was the chicken store before. I feel strange throwing it away.

516
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:16,460
BI have something to do. I don't know when I will be back.

517
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,750
You can wait well, right?

518
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,390
This person can throw it away then.

519
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,430
Uncle, your name is Ji Eun Tak?

520
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,320
Why do you have so many names, Uncle?

521
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,860
You should give it to her. What would I say when I give it to her?

522
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,940
Then I will give it.

523
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,160
Then give it to Sunny and tell her to give it.

524
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,990
Whatever happened, they have been living as neighbors since she moved to the rooftop of Sunny's house.

525
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,420
It's just the same. That would be more suspicious.

526
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,850
Me! I am the least awkward. Since I own the building.

527
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:56,990
Now that it is strange. I think it would be better if you would go since you are the strangest.

528
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,900
Me! Me! The Boss there was pretty.

529
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,030
Hello?

530
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:10,010
After 9 years, you now have an excuse.

531
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,620
No, can you uncles not hear me?

532
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,000
Who am I talking to?

533
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,290
Welcome.

534
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,860
Your boss?

535
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,260
She didn't come in today.

536
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,480
Oh.

537
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,680
Your boss?

538
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,990
She didn't come today, either. What's the matter?

539
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:10,830
♬  A day or two a week  ♬

540
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,910
Please enjoy.

541
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,430
Yes.

542
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,920
Oh!

543
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Your boss?

544
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,710
She's not here. What is your name? Should I call her?

545
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,830
No.

546
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,330
Can you give this to her?

547
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,110
Yes.

548
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:34,920

♬  I'll keep doing it  ♬

564
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,040
What is this?

565
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,410
I know. What is that?

566
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:25,710
It did not arrive at the current store but at the old store.

567
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,310
The owner of that building left it with a handsome man

568
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,290
and that man brought that,

569
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:33,680
and I checked on the CCTV...

570
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,580
He was really handsome.

571
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,520
At the old store? Where is that?

572
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,100
That's why it's strange. It came via international mail.

573
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,730
You have never been to that store, though.

574
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:50,190
It's so strange. He's so handsome to the point that it's strange.

575
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,920
What is it? It is my handwriting, though.

576
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:01,320
Mom, hello. My pretty mom who has been always worrying about me.

577
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,430
How is Heaven? Would it be like this place?

578
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:09,630
I am in Canada right now writing you a letter.

579
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,020
If you knew how I came here, you would be so surprised.

580
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:18,530
If I cross over through the door, a Heaven-like place such as this would be there.

581
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,780
If I am with Mister, that is.

582
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,980
I now have someone who asks about my well-being.

583
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,520
The things that you don't want me to see,

584
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,770
you might be worried and sorry about, but you don't have to now.

585
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:36,470
Thanks to that, I became special to someone.

586
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,230
I am living well, Mom, and it will get better.

587
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,930
More than anyone else, I will be happy.

588
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,520
Let's meet again. I love you, Mom.

589
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,890
From Canada, from Mom's daughter, Eun Tak.

590
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,230
From Canada?

591
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:59,560
I don't even have a passport.

592
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
What is this?

593
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,760
This would be so scary.

594
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:29,460
The person. Mister... is he Kim Shin?

595
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,480
What on earth happened 9 years ago?

596
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,730
What on earth did I forget?

597
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,410
Hello?

598
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,390
This is Yoo Shin Jae.

599
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:13,540
Hello. Wait a moment.

600
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:19,040
Yes, hello?

601
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,510
Hello?

602
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,280
Perhaps, were you expecting my call?

603
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:38,340
I was busy so I forgot that I left my phone number.

604
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:40,570
Ah, yes.

605
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,660
My thank you greeting is late but I'm thankful for last time.

606
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,600
Then what about a walk with me?

607
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,920
PD Ji, where did you say you live?

608
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:58,420
Me? I never told you where I lived though.

609
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,910
So, where do you live?

610
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:11,520
Near Incheon Art Platform.

611
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,400
Where near Incheon Art Platform?

612
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,560
It's kind of complicated how I live.

613
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,320
CEO, where are you?

614
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:26,190
I will be going near Incheon Art Platform later. In about 30 minutes.

615
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:33,020
Are you asking me out for a date?

616
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:43,080
Yes. I made up my mind to go on a date with you.

617
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,570
Call me if you are near. After about 30 minutes.

618
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,900
I also like that scent.

619
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,260
This is a scent that women like. You must be good with women's perfume.

620
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,960
Do you not like it that I know well about women's perfume?

621
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,420
What am I?

622
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,740
You are the only woman who knows my number.

623
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,700
Really? Why?

624
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,050
That's a bit strange.

625
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:49,440
There's nothing strange about it. We just talked on the phone a while ago.

626
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,060
Because I had no use for a phone recently.

627
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,030
I was in a place where there was no use for a phone. There was just a lot of snow.

628
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,000
Wait a moment.

629
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:16,730
I keep forgetting. I should take this regularly.

630
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:18,880
What is that medicine for?

631
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,380
A medicine for a sickness of the heart?

632
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,350
Starting when?

633
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:28,590
The reason... could I ask?

634
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:35,740
Honestly, I don't know when the start was.

635
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,380
You can run away.

636
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,620
I am being honest so I can give you the chance.

637
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,700
I am strange, right?

638
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,430
I will show you how I'm more strange.

639
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,070
I am going on a vacation.

640
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,380
Just in case you would suddenly come near the Art Platform...

641
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,320
I am telling you in advance.

642
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,460
Where are you going?

643
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,200
Abroad.

644
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,830
It's my first time going abroad so I'm so nervous.

645
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,880
I'm so tacky, aren't I?

646
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,020
You won't be nervous even though it's your first time.

647
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:20,310
You will be very natural as if you didn't come for the first time.

648
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:24,450
You will be like someone who lives there so don't worry.

649
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:28,920
You don't know me well though.

650
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,820
Believe me.

651
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,480
Now, I'm taking it.

652
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,420
One, two...

653
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,970
SBC Application for Annual Vacation.

654
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:52,280
No matter how I think about it, there must be something there. So I'm going to find out.

655
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,240
What is there?

656
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,190
I am going because I don't know.

657
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,690
Right. If you don't know you should go and ask.

658
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,860
While you're a year younger, go and ask.

659
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:07,370
You know if you wear a hoodie when you go abroad, you'll get in trouble with international law, right?

660
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:09,560
Yes.

661
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:13,210
Let's match your TPO. It's your first trip abroad after all.

662
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,360
Yes.

663
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:20,790
But then, you earned a lot of money since your business boomed.

664
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,140
Why aren't you moving?

665
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,720
PD Ji, you didn't know? This building is mine. I bought it.

666
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,680
Why wouldn't I know? You told me over 100 times already.

667
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,210
I'm asking why you are not moving.

668
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:36,390
A new house is bothersome. And I have a fear of new houses.

669
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:39,070
I don't mean it that way.

670
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:41,560
You didn't? The tangerines are delicious.

671
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,060
They are really delicious.

672
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:59,060
Excuse me. I have received this letter. It is from this hotel.

673
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,520
It is right, we sent it.

674
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,120
Ah, you're Korean. That's a relief.

675
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,020
The owner of this hotel is also Korean.

676
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:14,830
Ah, yes.

677
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:18,180
There was some development construction

678
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,980
and there were a few letters  found inside.

679
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,670
Though it's a first that a 10-year-old letter was found.

680
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,400
How did you know it was 10 years ago?

681
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,200
The design of the envelop is from 10 years ago.

682
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,380
It must be a precious memory. We are sorry it came late.

683
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:40,210
It's okay. There must be a reason for it to come in late.

684
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:44,370
God has a reason for each step...

685
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,210
Someone probably said that?

686
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,110
Nice.

687
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,680
♫ I love you  ♫

688
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,920
♫ Love you, love you ♫

689
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:59,660

690
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:05,240

01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:11,620

699
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,400
Today is really strange.

700
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,720
How could we bump into each other here?

701
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,840
I am in the middle of a business trip.

702
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:09,750
For the furniture edge, that... style reference. I need it.

703
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,680
What are you saying?

704
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,400
Have you been well?

705
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:22,440
Perhaps, did you follow me?

706
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,420
If I did, will I be arrested?

707
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:25,340
What should I do?

708
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,310
I'm not a bad person.

709
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,320
How would I know that?

710
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,770
You would know after we spend time together.

711
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,990
I don't have a reason for us to go together though.

712
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:34,780
Our company sponsored your program and last time you definitely said you would be treating me for a meal.

713
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:42,240
CEO, it's your first time in Canada, right? Then, let's head this way.

714
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:53,270
♫ See ya~ 
 Never go my way ♫

715
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:57,300
♫ Better will someday ♫

716
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:01,140
 ♫ Never far away ♫ 

717
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:09,200
♫ See ya~ 
 Never go my way ♫

718
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,180
♫ Better on my stay ♫

719
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:16,120
Goblin

720
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:22,190
To you who thought that my oblivion would be me being at peace...

721
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,740
I missed you.

722
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:34,910
I pray that in the next life... we would have a fate in which the wait is short and the meeting is long.

723
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:42,440
For a long time... farewell.

724
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,810
Perhaps, have we met before?

725
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:50,570
About 10 years ago?

726
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:51,850
CEO, over here.

727
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:53,850
Are you a ghost, by any chance?

728
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:56,880
Where would you find sadness that goes on for thousands of years??

729
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,170
I give one vote that there is one.

730
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,480
Which side are you going to put it on? 

731
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,080
On sadness or love?

732
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,940
♫ As we go on our way ♫

733
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,100
Sad love.

734
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,100
♫There's hurt in your eyes ♫

735
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:13,160
♫ Forever this life ♫

736
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,070
♫ As we go on our way ♫
