4
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,790
What is it?? Are you in pain?

5
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,450
Could it be because of the sword?

6
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,890
Mister...

7
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,360
I can grab the sword!

8
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,590
Wait a moment.

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,540
Wait a moment.  I'll pull it out for you.

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,840
It is moving.

11
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,250
The oracle was right.

12
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,360
The future seen for me was correct. 

13
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,360
Through this child, I can now end end this curse of immortality

14
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,420
and return to nothingness.

15
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,880
A human life is a hundred years at best. That I wish to turn around and look back once more,

16
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,540
is that just a life of an immortal? Or is it your face?

17
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,830
Ah.

18
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,820
I think it's your face.

19
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,460
- Episode 8 -

20
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,180
Mister, are you okay?

21
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,270
I think I should be the one asking that.

22
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,520
Is that right?

23
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,910
Oh, what an ordeal.

24
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,250
I'm sorry. You were startled a lot, right?

25
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,870
Mister didn't know that it would hurt like this,

26
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,060
since no one has ever grabbed it before.

27
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,490
By the way, you can really fly.

28
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,900
I wasn't asking you to show me this way.

29
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,010
That's a piece of gum. (cake, homonym for sword)

30
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,500
We should toughen up our hearts.

31
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,020
I see now that this is not something to be taken lightly.

32
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,710
But to be honest, I was more surprised that I could move the sword.

33
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,220
Aren't you really relieved?

34
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,020
With that, it has been proven that I am really the Goblin's bride, right?

35
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,740
I'm glad.

36
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,710
Are you not glad?

37
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,510
I'm glad.

38
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,070
See... I am really the bride.

39
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,330
This was fate.

40
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,330
Fate.

41
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,550
It's cool.

42
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,300
Why is this Uncle not home yet? I can't get my allowance until I fulfill my task.

43
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,610
Let's see what commotion there was today.

44
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,260
It is him.

45
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,910
Uncle, you were on the second floor? I was waiting all this time.

46
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,750
Uncle, hurry up and look at this.

47
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,800
By any chance, was this you, Uncle?

48
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,770
So how can you sit around like this? Take care of it.

49
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,610
- Was this really you? 
- I don't have any energy to explain, so don't ask.

50
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,100
We don't have any time. Hurry.

51
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,950
What on earth did you do?

52
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,620
Grandfather, listen to what I'm going to say now, carefully.

53
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,380
Uncle... no, not me. Uncle!

54
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,530
Secretary Kim, listen carefully to what I'm going to say starting now.

55
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,520
From this very moment, by gathering up the entire secretary's office at Cheon Woo Group--

56
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,560
No, not me.

57
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,510
It's not about me!

58
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,650
Uncle down the hall, we have to go somewhere.

59
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,970
Where?

60
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:51,610
Since Uncle lacks social skills, he shattered society.

61
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,510
From this moment, you are to request all the sites

62
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,000
which have links to the video remove them immediately.

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,610
Before it spreads, you are to block it quickly and precisely.

64
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,180
It might be easier and more effective if you tell the person in charge that Cheon Woo Group and its affiliates and subsidiaries will remove all its sponsoring ads.

65
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,870
Now... let's start.

66
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,080
Yes.

67
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,640
Now, everyone.

68
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,540
Okay, firstly, those whose car or property got damaged, please stand here.

69
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,420
Those who saw something disturbing and got mentally disturbed,

70
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,420
please line up over there.

71
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,620
The car was mangled due to a sudden gust of wind. That's all.

72
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,790
The money was just luck that fell out of the sky. That is it.

73
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,410
Also, you did not see me today.

74
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,560
Okay, next.

75
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,970
I'm next. By the way, isn't it really dark out here?

76
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,870
I wasn't feeling too good.

77
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,510
Could you please look into my eyes for a moment?

78
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,350
The car was mangled due to a sudden gust of wind.

79
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,150
The money fell down from the sky, that is it. Today you did not see me.

80
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,640
Okay... Next, next!

81
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,880
Yes, hurry, come this way.

82
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,310
Eyes, look at my eyes. Look.

83
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,960
Yes, next person.

84
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,300
What's your car type?

85
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,920
It'll be done here once we delete these files.

86
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,980
Can you look into my eyes for a moment?

87
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,510
I mean, what kind of couple fights like that to demolish 30 cars?

88
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,520
Do you know how much Uncle down the hall and I went through?

89
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,870
You did a good job. Thanks.

90
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,440
Don't be thankful. I just don't have the energy to fight, that's all.

91
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,650
Let's postpone this fight. It's disturbing enough as it is.

92
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,160
No matter how disturbed you are, it's worse for me.

93
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,640
How do you know whether it's not as bad or worse for me?

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,690
Hey, for me, this thing... this much, like this...

95
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,600
Never mind. Forget it.

96
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,520
Did you come back from nearly dying or something?

97
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,290
What's wrong with you guys, again?

98
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,790
Buckwheat, we don't have to leave anymore.

99
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,470
I'm the real bride. Surely!

100
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,720
Oh, it hurts.

101
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,120
Mister, what's wrong?

102
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,590
Surely, he's not dead, is he?

103
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,650
It's because of the medicine. Let him sleep.

104
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,220
If he sleeps like that, he won't get full rest.

105
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,820
You should carry him like this to the room.

106
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,950
Yes, do that. If you can do it, that is.

107
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,260
What's wrong? Why did you take the medicine?

108
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,150
Does it still hurt?

109
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,950
♬  Even though I don't understand when I look at you  ♬

110
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:33,730
♬  why my tears keep falling  ♬

111
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,700
Who exactly are you

112
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,570
♬  Were you coming back to me? ♬

113
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,610
that you pierce me like this?

114
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,820
♬ This love that can't be avoided.  ♬

115
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:56,800
♬   I love you, love you, love you   ♬

116
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:05,370
♬  I could feel we were fated to be ♬

117
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,180
♬   And I miss you, miss you   ♬

118
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,940
Our restaurant's radish is good.

119
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,400
♬ You are my fated person ♬

120
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,940
Thirty seven.

121
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,670
Thirty eight.

122
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,220
Let's go home after fifty people pass by.

123
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,640
I went easy on you.

124
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,770
He doesn't have a fever...

125
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,760
This grown-up adult passes out and sleeps anywhere.

126
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,180
Because it hurts.

127
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,590
You're awake?

128
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,850
It smells like a pain relief patch.

129
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,830
I was hurting here and there. Are you hurting a lot, too?

130
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,500
You said you were fine earlier.

131
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,580
It was a lie.

132
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,150
You're always lying.

133
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,620
Get well soon.

134
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,010
You don't even know where it hurts.

135
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,040
Where does it hurt?

136
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,510
First love hurts a lot.

137
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,510
She must've been really pretty.

138
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,560
I saw you wrote stuff down about it, too.

139
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,020
A lot. Every day...

140
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,440
She's pretty.

141
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,310
You're not feeling well at all. You're gravely ill.

142
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:36,130
Sleep a lot. So you can get well soon.

143
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,770
Don't do that.

144
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,670
Why? Why should I be nice to someone who only thinks about his first love?

145
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,640
Is that something to say to your bride?

146
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,480
If you look closely, you can see the pretty parts.

147
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,060
So don't leave.

148
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,070
Did I or did I not tell you not to say words that begin with "ch?" (beginning sound for Korean "first")

149
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,410
You're so petty.

150
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,810
Please put in all of the vegetables and toast the bread.

151
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,180
Yes.

152
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,760
Here's the bribe you ordered.

153
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,350
Fine. The item?

154
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,710
Can you actually interpret this?

155
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,760
It is a must for a third generation Chaebol to finish studying the Thousand-Character Classic at the age of three--

156
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,000
- But what is this?
- Your Uncle's  background information.

157
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,630
Especially about his first love. It's our secret.

158
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,480
This little girl... I enjoy digging up background information. Give it to me.

159
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,780
This is letter means "to hear," in case you don't know it.

160
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,820
God is still not listening.

161
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,800
You can't not know what this means after eating up all the sandwich.

162
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,810
- It's not allowed. 
 - It's a love letter.

163
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,610
- A love letter? 
 - Yeah.

164
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,650
It's a sad love confession.

165
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,420
"After living like that for hundreds of years, on that day,"

166
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,280
"on a day that was just right"

167
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,040
I had my suspicions. I guess it's just as I thought. It's fine, I know who it is.

168
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,580
- Who is it?
- I heard all about it.

169
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,710
Well, that can happen. There can be one woman you can't ever forget after 900 years.

170
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,720
- He said there's just one person?
- It's not?

171
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,670
- I wouldn't know about that.
- Oh, I got scared.

172
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,450
Anyway. About Kim Shin--

173
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,510
Who's Kim Shin?

174
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,210
- Your uncle. 
- My uncle's name is Kim Shin?

175
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,680
Our uncle's name is Yoo Shin Jae.

176
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,700
Well, it's a long story.

177
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,520
Anyway, about the sword in your uncle's chest.

178
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,640
Our uncle has a sword in his chest?

179
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,150
- Ah, what do you know about him?
- What's the sword about?

180
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,900
If you only tell me a little here and there, I'll get a gum-plex. 
 (Korean pun on complex, gum=sword)

181
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,040
If you keep doing this, I won't tell you something that only I know of.

182
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,540
What is something that only you know of?

183
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,070
You said he cried after looking at this painting? Him?

184
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,650
Yeah. He was completely bawling.

185
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,070
I kept telling him he couldn't, but Uncle down the hall

186
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,870
- kept asking to see-- 
- He really cried? Why?

187
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,910
I don't know. Go tell him off, Uncle. Let's get angry at him.

188
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,060
Hurry. Huh? Huh? Huh?

189
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,650
Why did you look at my painting? He said he tried to stop you.

190
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,140
He said you cried. Why would you cry when even I don't cry?

191
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,780
I was flustered, too, so I thought about it a lot.

192
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,680
Stendhal's syndrome.  I'm thinking maybe it's something like that. (psychosomatic reaction to seeing something beautiful)

193
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,010
It was really touching, and my heart felt really overwhelmed.

194
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,620
But who is it? The girl in the painting?

195
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,750
What are you going to do with that information?

196
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,890
It seemed like I saw her before somewhere.

197
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,380
Who's the woman that you saw? 
 That woman I know is my sister.

198
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,410
- You had a older sister, Uncle?
- Have you really seen my younger sister?

199
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,540
Think about it carefully, where you saw her.

200
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,750
Ah, younger sister.

201
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,200
I think it's one of the deceased I was in charge of, but I'm not sure about that, either.

202
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,230
This girl reincarnated? When?

203
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:34,210
I told you I'm not sure. Do you know how many people I've taken?
 How could I remember all their faces?

204
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,380
It just seemed like I saw her somewhere, so I am making that assumption.

205
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,880
I don't have memories, only feelings exist.

206
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,990
It was just really sad.

207
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,320
My heart ached.

208
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,040
Uncles, I got it. I think I know.

209
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,160
What if Uncle down the hall is a reincarnation of your younger sister? Uncle down the hall, try calling him Orabeoni (older brother) once.

210
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,240
- I'll kill you.
- I'll kill you.

211
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,260
Oh--

212
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,910
Orabeo--

213
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,840
Senior, have you heard?

214
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,340
About Kim Cha Sae from Jangam-dong?

215
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,350
What about Kim Cha Sae from Jangam-dong?

216
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,970
He went to get the deceased, but it turned out to be his wife in his former life.

217
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,920
So he classified her as a miscellaneously omitted and they ran off together.

218
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,410
- And then what?
- That's all.

219
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,170
I don't know what happened after that. They probably got caught though.

220
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,600
How did he remember his past life?

221
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,720
I don't know. That's why everyone is uneasy these days. I drink every day these days, too.

222
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,440
You only end up being filled with thoughts.They say if you commit a huge crime in your past life, you become a grim reaper.

223
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,440
What wrongdoing did I commit in my previous life, and how bad would it have been?

224
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,570
Could it be that my memory was erased so that I wouldn't be bothered by it?

225
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,480
That should I repent my past wrongdoing by doing this kind of work?

226
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,880
It must be a consideration on the part of God.

227
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,250
If you remember, you do. If you don't, you don't.

228
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,440
It should all be God's intention. However, to give back someone's lost memories,

229
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,370
I'm curious to what God's intention is.

230
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,760
In many ways...

231
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,680
Joon Yeong!

232
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,190
Mom!

233
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,240
Was it fun?

234
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,310
What shall we eat?

235
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm leaving.

236
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,250
Drink alcohol in moderation.

237
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,180
Work hard.

238
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,870
Mom, where is this place?

239
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,110
I think it's a tea place.

240
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,900
Ah. What are we going to drink? What are you going to order, Mom?

241
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,260
Mom ordered Heaven,

242
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,450
to give to Joon Yeong.

243
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,790
Heaven?

244
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,920
The Heaven that you have ordered has come out.

245
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,080
Thank you.

246
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,500
Mom, why are you crying?

247
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,030
- What are you doing? 
 - You surprised me!

248
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,890
What are you doing here right now?

249
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,740
I was on my way to the library.

250
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,460
How about you? Do you know this house?

251
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,370
Who are you?

252
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,620
Move out of my way for a sec.

253
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,740
Open the window, let some fresh air in, and button up your shirt.

254
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,030
You'll need this.

255
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,070
Let's go.

256
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,710
♬  Round and round ♬

257
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,230
♬ I never know why ♬

258
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,670
♬  Round and round ♬

259
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,660
♬ And it will show us way out ♬

260
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,240
♬ It’s my delight♬

261
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,850
Daddy!

262
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,280
How did you get here?

263
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,590
I called a taxi and showed the address to the driver.

264
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,440
It cost $5.20.

265
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,050
I want to go to this place.

266
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:34,130
I know where it is! Put your safety belt on.

267
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,700
- Daddy, I'm hungry. 
 - Huh?

268
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,020
Here you go.

269
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,310
Daddy, I missed you.

270
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,020
Me, too.

271
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,990
Today, too.... you were a little cool.

272
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,540
Sometimes the parents, the children, or the siblings

273
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,870
become the guardian gods for each other.

274
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,280
I merely gave him the sandwich.

275
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,970
It was his daughter who saved him, not me.

276
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,520
That's cool as well.

277
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,570
The price of a sandwich is no joke.

278
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,440
It's a good thing that President Yoo earns good money.

279
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,750
By the way, about the sword,

280
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,110
why did it suddenly move?

281
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,370
When I wasn't even able to grab it before? Right?

282
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:43,640
Maybe you need something stronger than the sign on your back?

283
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,410
 For example, real love? Something like that?

284
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,030
Hey, don't you have anything to tell me?

285
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,040
- No, I don't. 
 - I'm sure you do.

286
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,340
- Ohh, that? There is one thing. 
 - See?

287
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,620
You do have something to say. Don't hold back and say it. It's so apparent, so tell me. It's okay.

288
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,970
Whatever you say, you know that I'm the kind of person who will accept it without judgment.

289
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,800
I know that you're rich,

290
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,910
but are you alright with just being at home all the time?

291
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,170
That's what you wanted to say?

292
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,730
All you did was serve the country during the Goryeo Dynasty, right?

293
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,480
Hey, are you done with talking? I've had jobs, too!

294
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,920
It won't be eternal,

295
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,930
but it'll keep you from being drunk for a very long time.

296
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,310
It won't be eternal,

297
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,320
but it will be fragrant for a very long time.

298
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,460
It won't be eternal, but it will be useful for a very long time.

299
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,410
But why are you speaking informally?

300
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,400
I'm sorry, dear customer.

301
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,070
- Mr. Yoo Jae Shin!  
 - I'm sorry. (said informally)  
 - Hey!

302
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,540
I'm sorry about that, too. (informally)

303
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,120
That's why you've always been home. Because there's no profit.

304
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,870
Got no profit? What do you mean?

305
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,060
What do you think no profit means? It means you're lacking.

306
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,680
It's my first time hearing that kind of things being said to me! It's really my first time! Really!

307
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,120
I guess your first love never gave you this constructive criticism. Seeing how you've never heard it before.

308
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,780
Are you jealous right now?

309
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,660
What? Why would I be jealous?

310
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,390
I don't even know if she was from the Goryeo or the Joseon Dynasty.

311
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,950
When did you meet her? During the Goryeo Dynasty?

312
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,550
The Joseon Dynasty? In the beginning of the dynasty? The middle? The end?

313
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,270
She's probably very beautiful in a sophisticated way.

314
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,350
But you see, first love usually never works out.

315
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,990
Go back home. And don't wait for me

316
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,130
since I'll be late.

317
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,800
Who says it doesn't work out?

318
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,160
I don't like it...

319
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,640
Hey, why would you respond to my "Hey" by saying "Ho?" (Ya-Ho=hooray)

320
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,650
Don't you find it funny? All of us found it funny.

321
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,310
It's lame.

322
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,900
By the way...

323
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,850
your birthmark has faded a lot.

324
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,940
Really? Could it because I'm getting older?

325
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,110
But why do you keep spending money to buy this for me when I can't even drink it?

326
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,670
It's a waste of money.

327
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,220
Who else would take care of you by getting you coffee?

328
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,000
Did your college entrance exam go well?

329
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,010
Yes, of course.

330
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,050
That's why you should tell me before it's too late.

331
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,710
Other ghosts

332
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,000
are so enthusiastic about asking me to listen to their stories and remove their sorrow.

333
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,570
But why do you not ask me for anything?

334
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,830
I won't be able to come here often once I get into college.

335
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,730
Then, can you come here just once to see me?

336
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,650
With some pretty flowers?

337
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,920
I'm in Paju.

338
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,560
Yes, I'll come.

339
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,260
But... how did you die?

340
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,490
While on my way to the graduation ceremony

341
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,420
in a car accident...

342
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,550
Anyway, I'll be waiting for you!

343
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,450
I wonder what her story is.

344
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,920
- Welcome! 
 - Excuse me ...

345
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,510
How do you keep finding out where I am?

346
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,650
It was me who was more surprised. Why did it have to be here of all places?

347
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,630
I heard that the number of chicken restaurants in Korea is greater than the number of McDonalds in the entire world,

348
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,690
so why does it have to be this place of all places?

349
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,420
Because it's the chicken restaurant that Mister Goblin found for me.

350
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,560
As always, he's never helpful to my life.

351
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,160
What is it now?

352
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:59,390
Why do you keep showing up randomly like this and making my heart drop?

353
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,160
Why do you think I came to a chicken restaurant? It's to buy some chicken. Get me some chicken.

354
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,800
Stop talking nonsense. I know that you're vegetarian.

355
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,120
Even though you know that, give me some chicken.

356
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,600
That one! With lots of radishes.

357
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,860
Seriously?

358
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,140
Is this a meeting that had been pre-arranged?

359
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,700
The scene of that pre-arranged meeting,

360
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,870
did I come upon it? Very coincidentally?

361
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,590
Hey, what are you doing? You're not allowed to touch this hat so carelessly!

362
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,280
You're not supposed to be seen by people so carelessly, either!

363
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,230
Go there and remain silent in that corner.

364
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,230
Then, I can give you an extra drumstick.

365
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,950
Welcome!

366
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,980
Have you been well?

367
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,380
Sit wherever you'd like.

368
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,520
Please sit down. What would you like to eat?

369
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,270
I've been thinking that we could have some chicken for dinner today?

370
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,290
Don't you feel like you want to have chicken for dinner for some reason?

371
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:14,440
There is no other way but to have chicken for today's dinner.

372
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,600
I'm sorry for being egoistic,

373
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,970
- but today's dinner should be chic-- 
- Shut up. ("shut" sounds like chicken)

374
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,340
Mr. Reaper, come see me for a sec.

375
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,080
Go ahead and eat first. I'll be back before the crusts cool down.

376
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,190
Oh, I'll just go back to noth--

377
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,670
Why do you keep coming to my restaurant?

378
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,140
It couldn't be because of me.

379
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,820
By any chance, is my boss the purpose?

380
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,620
It's nothing like that. Only, I'm just going there to see her.

381
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,820
As long as you don't reveal my identity,

382
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,420
I think everyone can be at peace.

383
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,010
Just worry about yourself not saying anything.

384
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,030
The fact that Oppa Tae Hee came to my part-time work and smiled brightly at me

385
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,670
and that he took two orders when he left is a secret between us.

386
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,720
Secret?

387
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,260
He came to see you at your part-time work? And he smiled brightly at you?

388
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,820
Let's say that smiling brightly at you is something that should be kept secret.

389
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,040
But why is getting takeout a secret? Be honest. How many coupons did you give him?

390
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,510
Hey, you be quiet. How many times did that punk come by?

391
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:19,640
Let's say that he came by five times. Then how many coupons should he ideally get?

392
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,980
I told you to be quiet!

393
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,160
Hey, do you know thanks to whom he's such a great baseball player?

394
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,860
It's all thanks to me who used to be his guardian god a long time ago.

395
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,440
You don't know anything and what... ?

396
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,370
Let's say that's true. But do you really think you should take all the credit for his success?

397
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,930
It's all due to my first love's strong persistence. Don't you know about human persistence?

398
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,420
Look at me! I eventually managed to grab your sword!

399
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,290
- Let's see if I let you become pretty or not. 
 - Hey, hey!

400
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
Tell me how the untimely death system works.

401
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,380
I'll try to figure it out somehow if you just tell me the basic principles.

402
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,890
And I'll resolve the chicken coupon problem for you.

403
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,780
- Why would I ask for your help when I know a faster way to resolve it? Eun Tak! 
 - Hey.

404
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,290
- Ji Eun Tak! 
-  Wow!

405
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,920
I'm telling you, someone put back the piano without being noticed!

406
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,540
How could someone put back something so large and not even be noticed by any of the neighbors?  

407
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,100
It's like a ghost did it. It's so weird.

408
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,000
Hey, Ji Eun Tak.

409
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,040
You have a second, right? There's something I'm curious about.

410
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,450
Did you do well on your entrance exam?

411
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,390
You could say that... Why?

412
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,650
I guess you did really well on it. That's annoying.

413
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,540
You must have done well, too, since you're smart.

414
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,920
But you don't even take extra lessons outside of school. That's cool of you.

415
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,770
- Are you being sarcastic? 
 - I'm actually being sincere.

416
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,150
Which universities did you apply to as early admission? In case we overlap.

417
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,870
Even if it's to the same universities, we wouldn't overlap since I'm a social disadvantaged consideration candidate.

418
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,130
So... are you getting accepted?

419
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,530
What are you talking about?

420
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,210
I heard you can see ghosts. Don't ghosts tell you things like that?

421
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,880
I'm also curious as to whether I'm going to be accepted or not.

422
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,360
So that's what you were curious about.

423
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,120
But I like that you're direct instead of talking behind my back.

424
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,720
I can't help suppressing my curiosity by nature.

425
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,590
That must be why you are good at studying.

426
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,910
I just see them, they don't tell me anything.

427
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:29,570
I'll be going now.

428
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,160
For three years we were in the same class.

429
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,170
We had a  three years worth of conversation all in one day.

430
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,870
You have your interview for Seoun University tomorrow, don't you?

431
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,680
Good luck with it.

432
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,940
Y-You, too.

433
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,190
♬   It's a beautiful life, I will stay by your side   ♬

434
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,250
Why did you come here when you didn't even pay any attention to whether I left or not?

435
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,500
♬   It's a beautiful life, I'll stand behind you   ♬

436
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,380
- Are you sure you didn't forget to bring anything? 
- Like what?

437
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,740
Ohh, my scarf!

438
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,480
Because you kept ignoring my greetings, it kept distracting me!

439
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,340
♬   If I' am with you under the same sky   ♬

440
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:48,780
♬   Just breathing is good ♬

441
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,490
- Don't be scared and don't get nervous. 
 ♬  It's a beautiful life, beautiful day  ♬

442
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,900
♬   I will live in your memory, beautiful life   ♬

443
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,190
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬

444
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,930
- Would you like me to come with you? 
 ♬   Beautiful day  ♬

445
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,580
- Am I a kid? 
♬   Stay by my side ♬

446
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,110
- Why isn't the bus coming? 
 - Are you still mad at me?

447
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,850
- I was going to be, but it got ruined because of the scarf. 
 ♬   Beautiful my love   ♬

448
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,110
- So you are jealous. 
- So what if I am? Are you happy that I'm jealous? 
  ♬   Beautiful my heart  ♬

449
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,690
Yes. It made me feel good all day.

450
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,800
♬ It's a beautiful life♬

451
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,590
Then go home now.

452
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,850
I'll do well on my interview.

453
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,440
Thank you for the scarf!

454
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,380
Be careful, there's someone behind you.

455
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,510
I'm sorry.

456
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,330
I was going to avoid bumping into them.

457
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,780
Your eyes are really big and clear, so everything gets reflected! Really!

458
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,490
Yeah, alright, so get on the bus.

459
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,690
A pickpocket! He's a thief!

460
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,160
Bye!

461
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:06,100
Why you? You weren't in that scene...

462
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,030
What did you say?

463
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,640
My mom will kill me this time if I do badly on my interview again.

464
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,730
I wish there was an accident instead.

465
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,440
Hey, don't say things like that. They say be careful what you wish for.

466
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,010
Whether I die by my mom's hands or in an accident,

467
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,710
people all die anyway.

468
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,820
Hah!

469
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,140
Oh, this is so tiring so early in the morning!

470
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,410
Please have some coffee.

471
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:53,080
Hey, it's me who said that I was feeling tired. Why do you only give him coffee?

472
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,570
I told him not to get one for you.

473
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,480
- Are you still mad at me?
- Who says that I am mad?

474
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,490
Everyone says so, that you're still mad.

475
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,660
As long as you know.

476
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,130
There are people that I don't recognize.

477
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,450
Even those from Hannam area volunteered.

478
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,780
It seems like it is indeed a huge accident.

479
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,740
I heard that even the volunteering team each got five sheets. But you have a lot.

480
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,380
It's my jurisdiction.

481
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,710
Kim Hyeon Jeong, age 34.

482
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,950
 Park Su Bin, age 2, accident.

483
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,500
It seems like it's a mom and child.

484
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,380
I guess I'll have to prepare a Heaven again.

485
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,210
Pardon?

486
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,680
Why don't you close up early and go home?

487
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,950
I haven't even started selling yet you want me to close up?

488
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:06,260
I mean, what are you talking about?

489
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,640
It means that I'm going to buy everything you have.

490
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,480
Why are you so impatient?

491
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,740
Do you even know what these are?

492
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,990
They're socks. So how about it? Will you agree to it?

493
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,280
This crazy bastard!

494
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,110
You're that bastard from the bus stop the other day, right?

495
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,000
Who are you to keep following me?

496
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,240
Who do you think I might be?

497
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:35,090
The money you stole is only $23, $32,

498
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,700
$10 and three vouchers.

499
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,470
Do you how many people could have been dead today because of this?

500
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,590
What are you? A cop?

501
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,920
The owner of this wallet you just pickpocketed from will have to be hospitalized for three weeks.

502
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,890
He will go to work without even wearing a cast because he'd be fired if he missed three weeks of work. All because of you.

503
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,080
What the hell are you talking about? Is this wallet yours by any chance?

504
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,470
He'll have to use his salary as his hospital fee, and his not wearing a cast will cause him to get a shock later in life. Because of you.

505
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,240
Shut up if you don't want to die.

506
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,590
I'm asking who you are, you bastard.

507
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,190
I don't like letting someone like you live,

508
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,520
but it would be a side-effect of my intervening in the life and 
death of human beings, so just go on living.

509
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:20,690
Don't think that you've received enough punishment by this encounter.

510
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,530
You're going to be punished again even after your death.

511
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:31,990
However, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is my method.

512
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,640
It will hurt a bit. Bear it.

513
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,060
Ouch!  Ouch! Ouch!

514
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,380
Get ready. Today's task will start soon.

515
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,810
Yes, yes.

516
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:10,350
The bus in question is approaching now.

517
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,810
Oh, it's Mr. Reaper!

518
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,490
Did that girl just see you?

519
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,020
Is she really seeing us right now?

520
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,430
Some of the people confronting their imminent death can be like that.

521
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,960
I feel sorry that she's so young.

522
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,850
Why is she there?

523
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,160
Does anyone have Ji Eun Tak on their list?

524
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,780
Who are you talking about?

525
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,060
That's true.

526
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,140
There's an extra person on the bus who's not listed.  Wasn't everyone supposed to die?

527
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,650
Wait a sec. What happens if one is left out?

528
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,360
I don't think any accident will take place today. We came here for nothing.

529
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,140
What? Why?

530
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,600
Oh, the bus is not supposed to just continue going like that!

531
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,020
It shouldn't be moving normally. There's supposed to be an accident happening right now! It's leaving safely!

532
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:17,420
What should we do? Don't we have to cause an accident then?

533
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,480
The bus... just went... without anyone dying.

534
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,980
This has never happened during my 300-year-long career of a Reaper.

535
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,500
Seriously. What should we do?

536
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,030
It's my first time witnessing the coming to existence of a miscellaneously omitted person.

537
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,960
This is indeed a miracle!

538
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Miracles do happen...

539
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,450
- Wow. 
 - "Wow?"

540
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,410
Do you know how much paperwork this miracle entails?

541
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,130
What should I do with this little thing!

542
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,720
I'm sorry, sir. I was just very amazed.

543
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,420
But how did you predict this?

544
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,750
What a scare!

545
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,820
I-I think it's a Goblin.

546
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,480
Why? Do I look like one?

547
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,520
Let's have a conversation.

548
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,340
- Why didn't you tell me? 
- Why do you keep on interfering with human lives?

549
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,760
Ji Eun Tak nearly died today.

550
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,020
If that's that child's fate, it cannot be avoided.

551
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,870
Says who?

552
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,130
The only thing I cannot grant is my own death.

553
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,920
Do you want to see me interfere with every human life for that child?

554
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,070
You! In someone else's workplace...

555
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,490
But... the accident was strange, regardless of how I think about it.

556
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,550
A few days ago, I already saw the accident.

557
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:44,790
But Eun Tak wasn't there. I also saw that child's future ten years from now.

558
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,000
But this was an accident that would have definitely killed her.

559
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,140
It is because that accident that you saw wasn't part of the miscellaneously omitted person's fate.

560
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,520
She only got into that accident as a variable.

561
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,650
Because you were going to save her.

562
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,560
Oh, thanks to the Miscellaneously Omitted person whose boyfriend is a goblin,

563
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,100
all those who were supposed to die ended up living.

564
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,860
You made me have to work overtime.

565
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,500
Would you like to eat some chicken for a midnight snack?

566
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,720
Have you really not had any thoughts of turning into ashes?

567
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:19,980
It was a joke. Don't take it that seriously.

568
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,420
I'm wondering what exactly it means to turn into ashes...

569
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,430
Is it like dispersing as dust, wind, or rain?

570
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,920
To somewhere in the world?

571
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,610
Why do you even wonder? The Miscellaneously Omitted can't even grab the sword.

572
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,870
Eun Tak... grabbed the sword.

573
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,990
The sword even moved, so I...

574
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,270
I almost killed that child.

575
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,780
It hurt so much.

576
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,810
It was the first time I felt that kind of pain.

577
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,490
Don't you think you should tell her the truth now?

578
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,900
About what will happen when the sword is taken out?

579
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,520
No.

580
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:10,090
If possible I want to hide it, for about 80 more years.

581
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,080
- Why?
- That's a human lifespan exactly.

582
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,740
That is the maximum years a 19-year-old can live to be.

583
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,710
I want to do that.

584
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,870
But will that happen?

585
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,480
Will it not be possible?

586
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,970
[Seoun University Admission Ticket]

587
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,040
Did you come to pick me up? I'm surprised!

588
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,160
What I ate for lunch hasn't been digested yet. That's why I came out.

589
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,490
I know. There's no way that you would come out just so that I would be comfortable.

590
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,490
Huh? What is all this?

591
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,260
Why socks?

592
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,200
The 20s and 30s of someone whom I managed to save today.

593
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,970
Oh...

594
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,540
In order to save my 20s and 30s,

595
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,330
did you decide to start selling socks from today on?

596
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,150
Because I asked you why you were jobless?

597
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,530
- Do you want to do it with me? 
 - Alright.

598
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,520
Since all my interviews have ended, I have time now. So I'll take care of Mister better.

599
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,090
In what ways are you going to take care of me?

600
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,590
What are you doing?

601
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:06,090
I'm strengthening my arm. I'm going to make sure I pull it out in one go next time without hurting you.

602
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:10,990
I realized last time that arm strength is important.

603
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,560
Take it easy.

604
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,530
What is this? A cheer that's making me feel deflated?

605
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,890
Would you mind giving us some privacy?

606
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:38,600
- With whom? 
 - I just need a second. Go to your room.

607
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,340
Come here, huh?

608
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,130
Come down here for a sec. Don't you think that I've been punished enough?

609
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:01,070
Are you that against my receiving a tiny present?

610
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,620
You showed me that in advance on purpose, right? To prevent me from taking any action.

611
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,860
Do you think I'll make that choice just because of that?

612
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,330
I'm not going to! I'm never going to, even under the threat of death!

613
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,930
Come down, will you? Come down, and let's talk face to face!

614
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,530
Hey!

615
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:25,560
Do you think you'll be scared? Just come down! Seriously, this fellow...

616
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,960
Is he still sick... ?

617
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,340
I didn't look. Really.

618
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,620
I really don't like it.

619
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,000
I, who likes you,

620
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:54,870
couldn't be this stupid.

621
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:02,690
What did you... just say to me?

622
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,440
- Never mind if you didn't hear it. 
- I heard everything.

623
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,120
Then I'm glad.

624
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,190
So... that is...

625
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,790
He confessed to me earlier... ?

626
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,210
That man... Seriously...

627
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,740
48...

628
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,790
49...

629
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,720
50.

630
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,050
Huh?

631
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,490
What?

632
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,540
Because you never call me, I didn't even bother to check my phone!

633
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,800
You surprised me!!

634
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,600
I was surprised that you were the first to call me.

635
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,990
And ten times at that which I missed.

636
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,560
That's because I thought of something I wanted to tell you when I was working late.

637
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,050
It seems to be a very important thing to say.

638
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,300
Yes, indeed.

639
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,690
About my religion. I have none.

640
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:06,900
 How does he speak so well?  Do you have a religion by any chance?

641
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:12,370
 So there's something else I need to do again.  I will contact you again when it is ready.

642
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:16,640
You called me ten times to tell me that?

643
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,530
I thought I should tell you as soon as possible.

644
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,430
How cute!

645
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:27,190
I'm... cute?

646
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,920
Didn't you know that? Did no other woman tell you that?

647
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,640
I'm not seeing any woman.

648
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,100
That's a good thing! That! Not seeing anyone else!

649
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:42,510
Don't get ready to see other women. Everything's perfect right now.

650
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,260
Understood?

651
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,260
Is this guy a player?

652
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,730
Answer me in a really, really honest way.

653
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:58,010
I'll tell you, too.

654
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,140
What is it that I should answer?

655
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,130
My real name has only one syllables.

656
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,670
Kim Sun.

657
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,900
My parents wanted me to be well off,

658
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,340
so they hired someone to come up with my name despite being poor.

659
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,730
Apparently that clairvoyant said it had to be that name.

660
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,220
But I prefer Sunny.

661
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,960
It gives off the impression that I'm sparkling.

662
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,190
I hated that name so much.

663
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:32,170
It sounds a bit pitiful and feels like it has a history.

664
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,640
Kim Sun.

665
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,940
At this time each year, he goes to that place,

666
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,370
and sends off a lantern.

667
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:55,220
Mister Kim Woo Bin, what's your real name?

668
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,240
I know that that's a fake name.

669
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,100
I won't tease you even if your real name doesn't suit you,

670
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,030
so can you please reveal your real name to me now?

671
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,200
[King]

672
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,510
 Put down that sword which is full of rage and apprehension.

673
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:07,000
Go as far as possible, and as much as possible, never return.

674
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:13,070
By that, you mean... How can you say that?

675
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,360
It is Your Majesty's Goryeo.

676
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,540
I defended its borders because you ordered me to protect them

677
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:23,470
and I destroyed the enemies because you ordered me to kill them.

678
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,330
When my sister is in this country, and so are the citizens, how can--

679
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,400
Now you're worrying about things

680
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,160
that a king should be worried about.

681
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,270
Send a message that you died a heroic death, and I will send a message that I lament it. 

682
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,500
It's a king's order.

683
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,790
What's wrong? Are you in pain somewhere?

684
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,990
Chest? Towards the middle? What did you have for dinner?

685
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,040
Are your hands cold? Give me your hands.

686
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,120
Massaging your hands will allow blood to circulate well.

687
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,730
I'm sorry, but can you look at my eyes, please?

688
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,690
What?

689
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:57,830
Let's say that this meeting never took place today.

690
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,540
I'm sorry that I couldn't walk you home.

691
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,140
Go back home.

692
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:21,730
Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @viki.com

693
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,590
Where did he go?

694
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,830
In the future,

695
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,640
you will have to take care of the Lord.

696
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,230
So you must remember this day well.

697
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:49,240
Why is he sending off the lantern? Who are they for?

698
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,940
They are the people

699
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,600
whom Lord has been feeling sorry about for a long time.

700
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,370
But Grandpa! Did you know that there was a sword stuck in my uncle's heart?

701
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,410
How do you know that?

702
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,360
You should not let him know that you know about it.

703
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,980
Why?

704
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,080
That sword is

705
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,910
an award as well as a punishment for our Lord.

706
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:41,320
It's the reason for his existence

707
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,740
and will lead to his end. 

708
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,230
 You who are my life as well as 

709
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,860
 my death, 

710
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:18,720
 I love you. 

711
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,180
 Therefore, I'm keeping a secret 

712
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,940
 and asking a higher power for its permission, 

713
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,670
so that you won't know for even just one more day.

714
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,130
 So that you won't know for a hundred years.

715
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:27,290
You know me, right? There are some things that I should let you know.

716
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:29,530
You have some time, don't you?

717
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,320
Be quick, will you?

718
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,490
I'm not in the right mood to face any gods at the moment.

719
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,220
Something went wrong...

720
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:49,490
Probably...

721
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,410
everything started from you.

722
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,310
Where on earth did he go?

723
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,420
This is why I told him to let me know before leaving

724
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,930
even if he reappears without telling me.

725
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,160
What are you curious about?

726
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,290
Oh, yes.

727
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:26,680
I thought I told you once.

728
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:30,230
When the bride appears, I have to prepare to go even farther away.

729
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,930
There's something that I'm feeling weird about.

730
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,210
About the sword in Mister Goblin's heart,

731
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:40,760
what will precisely happen

732
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,970
when the sword gets pulled out?

733
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,540
He kept mentioning that he was going to go somewhere.

734
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:49,280
- So you're not leaving anymore? 
- For now.

735
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:53,180
I have to prepare to go even farther away.

736
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,520
Where is that place?

737
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,830
Get that sword pulled out of you as soon as you can.

738
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:11,150
Get it pulled out and go into nothingness.

739
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:16,630
You appeared out of nowhere and the first thing you're telling me is to die...

740
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:19,130
You should at least explain to me your reasons.

741
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:21,660
You've lived enough.

742
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,290
But that's not the case for that kid.

743
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,070
I was really happy when I found out her identity. So just...

744
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:30,930
end things right now.

745
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,000
That's ironic.

746
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:40,430
I don't know what decision you're telling me to make.

747
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:43,660
And when I was first born as Kim Shin,

748
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,550
you must have been the one who blessed me.

749
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,690
Aren't I your child?

750
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,840
That's why I'm telling you all this.

751
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:54,740
For my kid, Kim Shin, whom I wanted to be happy,

752
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,650
it must be something you want the most.

753
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:01,880
- What do I want? 
 - You want that kid to live.

754
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,130
If you don't go into nothingness,

755
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,930
Eun Tak will die.

756
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,570
What you're saying is that

757
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,870
it's because he wants to die

758
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,640
that he asked me to become his bride

759
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:22,350
and pull out that sword?

760
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,080
So,

761
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,040
if I pull out that sword,

762
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,890
he will die?

763
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,090
So

764
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,950
if I pull out that sword,

765
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,890
Ajusshi will disappear?

766
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,000
from this world, completely?

767
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,800
Ever since she was born, she's been fated to pull out that sword for you. No,

768
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,980
to be more precise, you caused her to be born with that fate.

769
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,280
If she fails to execute her task as a tool, the reason for her existence will disappear

770
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,010
because then there won't be any reason why she should exist.

771
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,360
Therefore, if she doesn't pull the sword out,

772
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,790
death will constantly come before that child.

773
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:33,150
I'm sure she's already confronted death multiple times.

774
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,110
- This thing!
 - Good bye!

775
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,230
You're thinking right, those accidents...

776
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,630
There will be more in the future.

777
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:53,070
Those accidents will occur more frequently, and they'll be more intense than the ones up to now

778
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:55,780
Even you almost killed her

779
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:58,320
once with your own hands...

780
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,290
 It's moving!

781
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,940
"After living like that for hundreds of years, on that day,

782
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,290
on a day that was just right,

783
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,220
it was first love.

784
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,720
To be able to confess that 

785
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:35,160
I'm seeking

786
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:38,450
permission from the heavens.

787
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:57,840
♬   Where are you, who I am ♬

788
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,160
♬   Who I am, Who I am ♬

789
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:04,950
♬   Loneliness was like a prison   ♬

790
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:07,280
♬   (Loneliness)  ♬

791
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,850
♬  Although many people passed   ♬

792
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:17,500
♬   This place is where everyone walked passed me  ♬

793
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,230
♬   Where I am  ♬

794
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:29,180
♬   Who are you, Who are you   ♬

795
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:35,020
♬   Overwhelming joy   ♬

796
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,990
♬   Searching and turning this world inside out like crazy   ♬

797
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,220
♬   Even in my dream I'm grasping for you.  ♬

798
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,670
♬   Where are you  ♬

799
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,280
♬   I'll certainly find you   ♬

800
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,060
♬   I'll certainly recognize you   ♬

801
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:02,970
♬   Wherever you are. Whatever you look like   ♬

802
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,430
♬   I'll certainly recognize you    ♬

803
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:08,770
♬   I will remember   ♬

804
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:12,670
♬ I will look at you ♬

805
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:17,370
♬ Even at a place without you, even if many years pass by   ♬

806
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,990
♬  I will not forget ♬

807
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:25,720
♬ When I hold you tightly like this  ♬

808
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:30,210
♬   I keep forgetting about everything  ♬

809
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:34,860
♬ The place I have to return to   ♬

810
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,220
♬ I'll certainly find you  ♬

811
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,700
♬ I'll certainly  recognize you  ♬

812
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:46,160
♬ Wherever you are. Whatever you look like  ♬

813
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,700
♬ I will recognize you, I will remember  ♬
