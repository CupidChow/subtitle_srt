Episode 15

5
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,060
Oh. You again.

6
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,410
I know.

7
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,460
"I know?" Did I just say that?

8
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,550
Wait!

9
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,510
Lady!

10
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,800
- Me? 
- It's good to see you here.

11
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,780
Do you know me?

12
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,960
No, but that necklace you're wearing.

13
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,790
- This?
- I made that.

14
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,960
A man asked me to design it. It must've been ten years ago.

15
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,070
Ten years? What man?

16
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,400
You should know better. You're the owner of the necklace. Do you know what it means?

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,250
- No.
- It means "a match made in heaven" in French.

18
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,920
Destiny made outside of man's boundary.

19
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,690
Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?

20
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,180
What's this? (speaking Japanese)

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
(speaking Russian)

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,010
Enough. You don't have anywhere to go anymore.

23
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,470
There's one place I couldn't go. Where she is.

24
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,040
Then go there. I give you permission.

25
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Could I? Could I go all the way there and upset her?

26
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,670
Is it better to upset me? You're driving me crazy!

27
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,140
I feel empty. That's why.

28
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,130
Are you insane?

29
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,880
This guy lived a long time as well.

30
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,730
Return it! Before there is some international conflict!

31
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,500
He said leave. Let's go. He's scary when he's mad.

32
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,250
Ah, today is so strange. How could I meet you here?

33
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,280
I am in the middle of  a business trip. For the furniture edge, that... style reference. I need it.

34
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,160
What is he saying?

35
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,990
Have you been well?

36
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,840
Perhaps... did you follow me?

37
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,810
If I did, will I be arrested?

38
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,890
- What should I do?
- I'm not a bad person.

39
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,120
- How would I know that?
- You would know after we spend time together.

40
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,520
I don't have a reason for us to go together though.

41
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,270
Our company sponsored your program and last time you definitely said you would be treating me for a meal.

42
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,570
CEO, it's your first time in Canada, right? Then, let's head this way.

43
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,790
But... did I ever say I was going to Canada?

44
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,320
- I think I just said I was going abroad.
- I'm pretty sure you mentioned Canada.

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,740
- You said something like the maple nation... 
 - Oh! Maple Nation!

46
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,190
Yes. I remember. This way.

47
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,740
♬ Only your voice is heard loudly above everything  ♬

48
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,100
Will that be enough?

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,300
It's okay. It's nice since it feels like we're on a picnic.

50
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,670
Not you, but me.

51
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,920
Will this be enough for me? Do you know how much I sponsored?

52
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,010
♬ Maybe I am really crazy. ♬

53
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,280
This... it's not a vacation that I planned. I just came here suddenly.

54
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,440
So I could only exchange just a little bit of money...

55
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,690
- What do you like?
- Beef.

56
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,420
I don't like meat that much.

57
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,610
You do like it.

58
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,070
How do you know?

59
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,290
Geez. Is there anyone who doesn't like meat?

60
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,480
Don't mix words. Did you do some background check on me?

61
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,610
To see if my family would match your family or something?

62
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,980
Who says I'm dating you? You aren't really that good, you know!

63
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,070
But still, you have to treat me with meat.

64
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,660
It must be delicious. I will contact you later. Then, I'll be going.

65
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,780
There's  not much to see here. This way. I will be your guide.

66
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,470
Can you?

67
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,970
I think I'm being such a nuisance.

68
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,060
It's okay. It's because you're excited that's why.

69
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,080
You must know Quebec well. Did you already come here before?

70
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,050
Yes. I came with my first love.

71
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,460
This is my fourth time.

72
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,400
So you have a girlfriend.

73
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,120
- We broke up for now. 
 - Why did you break up?

74
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,910
I left for a long time... and went somewhere far.

75
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,000
She must have had a hard time. She forgot all about me.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,650
They say that first loves don't come true.

77
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,580
You must have loved her a lot.

78
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,100
That must be the case, seeing how it's so hard to hold it in.

79
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,600
What are you holding in?

80
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,480
To hold her hand and hug her. Those things.

81
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:55,160
The woman forgot already but you haven't yet.

82
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,210
Yes.

83
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,830
Not even a day or a moment.

84
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,630
Good for that woman.

85
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,370
Do you know what?

86
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:14,900
If you catch a falling maple leaf, love will come true with the one you are walking with.

87
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,030
It must be your first love who said that.

88
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes. And we also caught a maple leaf.

89
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,690
And you believed that? It didn't come true. You are here now with me.

90
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,720
Because your love did not come true and you are drawn to me.

91
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,780
Men always talk about women in their past to the woman they are drawn to, just like a fool.

92
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,600
- Is that so? 
 - Isn't it so?

93
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,470
Is he a fool? Is he in grade school? He believes that love will come true if you catch a maple leaf?

94
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,220
Geez! He didn't even know that he was fooled by the woman. Fool.

95
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,060
Who on earth are you?

96
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,900
Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?

97
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,820
I don't remember.

98
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,340
I don't know what memory I can't remember, either.

99
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,630
What on earth?

100
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,120
Nothing comes to mind. Nothing pops up.

101
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,830
Let's just go and ask. That would be fast.

102
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,530
Why are you here? Are you staying at this hotel?

103
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,420
- Yes. 
 - Oh.

104
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,420
But perhaps... perhaps...

105
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:59,510
have we met before? About 10 years ago?

106
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,540
Mister!

107
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,940
This comment is a bit... I'm not seducing you...

108
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,860
It's just that I keep getting a strange feeling.

109
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,210
Do you like me?

110
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,480
No. I'm not trying to seduce you.

111
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,420
Yes.

112
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,750
I like you.

113
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,590
For your information,

114
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,240
I don't have a boyfriend.

115
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,210
In this life, I must not have luck with guys.

116
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,600
Just saying.

117
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,630
Then, I'll be going. Have a good walk.

118
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,550
- Excuse me. 
 - Excuse me.

119
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,160
You go ahead first.

120
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,760
As expected, a sandwich was not enough.

121
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,280
How about early dinner? Aren't you hungry?

122
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,420
My treat.

123
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,040
I was also going to ask you to eat.

124
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,580
I know a delicious beef place.

125
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,110
Beef.

126
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,640
I was so short-sighted. I didn't bring any sneakers so my feet hurt so much.

127
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,140
Even if your feet hurt, you must've looked pretty. It's okay.

128
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,830
You now realize that you should bring sneakers next time.

129
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,430
That's what I mean. It's not as though I've been abroad before...

130
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,160
Why would you go abroad when you're in your nines? (Years ending in 9 are thought to be dangerous) 

131
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
When I was 29, I didn't even go to the supermarket in front of my house. 

132
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,390
Really? Thank you.

133
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,730
Yeah. Because I didn't have any appointments.

134
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,310
But I'm getting around so well for someone who's never been abroad before.

135
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,510
I just get lost a little and did not skip meals. And I will be eating a big steak.

136
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,270
I... am here in a cool restaurant with a guy.

137
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,050
What about the restaurant? It's the man who should be cool.

138
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,660
I'm sleepy. I'm hanging up.

139
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,840
Okay. Goodnight.

140
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,000
So the future that I saw was right.

141
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,900
CEO, over here.

142
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,410
So in the end you met that CEO punk.

143
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,490
I can't hide my smile. I feel helpless.

144
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,570
Did you perhaps come here with your first love?

145
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,670
You fed her something really expensive.

146
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,950
But it didn't matter. She forgot everything.

147
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,300
You met her even after you broke up with her?

148
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,920
- Yes.
- I see.

149
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,880
I heard that first love gets beautified and revised in your 
memory, so if you see her again for real it's not that great.

150
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,280
- No. She's still pretty.
- Excuse me!

151
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,090
I'm going to order. Have you chosen what you're going to eat?

152
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,470
Ah, yes. I will have--

153
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,570
Instead of still pretty, how about becoming pretty now?
 I'm becoming pretty now. Of course, in my perspective.

154
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,350
Should we meet again tomorrow?

155
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,250
- I have an afternoon flight tomorrow.
- Before you leave.

156
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,040
Even after you leave.

157
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,230
Welcome!

158
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,660
She isn't here today, either.

159
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,550
Can you please give this to her?

160
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,900
That's why I wanted to go to work.

161
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,040
Excuse me.

162
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,830
Wow. Oh, that surprised me.

163
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,370
- Were you looking for me?
- Yes.

164
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,380
You're Yoo Deok Hwa, correct? Owner of my former store?

165
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,090
Do you remember that chicken place 9 years ago?

166
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,570
Of course. Your rent was late quite often. What brings you here?

167
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,990
You sent a letter through this person, right?

168
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,030
Could I have this person's contact information?

169
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,150
This person's? Not my contact information?

170
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,490
I'm a bit busy.

171
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,540
Not Sun Hee, Sunny

172
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,920
Let's see. Is there an obscure place

173
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,950
for people who are just starting to date?

174
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,810
There isn't much here. Let's go this way.

175
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,730
Is this person...

176
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,990
you?

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,320
CEO, are you a ghost, by any chance?

178
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,240
Did you die at this time?

179
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,920
Is that why you keep appearing before me?

180
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,060
Do you still...

181
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,050
see dead people?

182
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,240
Still?

183
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,620
How did you know I could see ghosts?

184
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,670
What are you? Are you really a ghost?

185
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,820
I asked how you knew I could see ghosts!

186
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,280
Is your name... Kim Shin?

187
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,940
Ten years ago, you came here with me.

188
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,700
Am I correct? But why can't I remember anything?

189
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,980
Answer me. Who are you?

190
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,000
Why did I write to myself that I couldn't forget you?

191
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,730
Why did I write down that I'm your bride?

192
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,190
You're Kim Shin, right?

193
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,020
Am I right?

194
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,300
No.

195
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,960
It's late. Get back to the hotel.

196
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,770
- Why aren't you surprised?
- Pardon?

197
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,330
I just sat here without permission and why aren't you surprised?

198
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,990
Do you know who I am?

199
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,690
It looks like you do.

200
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,700
No, it's my first time seeing you.

201
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,250
But since you just sat down ....

202
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,060
You came to my shop right? With PD Ji's letter?

203
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,340
Yes.

204
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,030
And you cried in the street.

205
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,430
The day was cold,

206
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,120
but a full-grown man was walking as he was crying, so it stayed in my mind.

207
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,340
Did you cry after seeing me?

208
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,600
I've seen people surprised, but I've never seen anyone cry after seeing me.

209
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,160
You resemble another woman.

210
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,830
I'm not a common face.

211
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:20,100
Anyway, let's introduce ourselves. Your name is?

212
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
Wang Yeo.

213
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,640
It sounds like the name of a king.

214
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm Sunny.

215
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,280
S-U-N-N-Y.

216
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,790
I wanted to see you.
 (Sounds the same as 'I missed you'.)

217
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,650
I saw the CCTV.

218
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,530
You looked so handsome and I was so curious to see the  real person.

219
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,010
But the screen is better.

220
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,490
Thank you for bringing the letter.

221
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,340
Thanks to that, our PD Ji got to travel abroad.

222
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,640
Since I've seen you in person, I'll get going now.

223
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,190
I need to get to work.

224
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,400
The day is cold, so don't walk crying.

225
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,430
Your face will freeze.

226
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,550
It was nice

227
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,960
meeting you.

228
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,550
It was nice meeting you, too...

229
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,290
Kim Woo Bin.

230
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,350
Remember.

231
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,180
You have to remember. That person's name is...

232
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,920
Kim Shin.

233
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:12,030
Why is it raining so hard? And why isn't Part-timer coming?

234
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,110
The phone is turned off, so you will be connected to voicemail.

235
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,160
What's going on?

236
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,960
Oh my! What are you doing?

237
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,630
Grandma didn't come back.

238
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,300
Then you have to go in.

239
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,030
You're Eun Tak's friend, right? Come in for now.

240
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,570
Noona Eun Tak isn't here.

241
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,640
She skipped work today.

242
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,750
Come in.

243
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,910
Here. It's hot.

244
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,800
Make sure you blow on it before drinking.

245
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,890
- When's your grandma coming back?
- Later, at night. After she makes money.

246
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,040
Your life is pretty cold, too.

247
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,300
Grandma said that there are a lot of people colder than I am.

248
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,280
You're nice.

249
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,910
It's that god who is the problem.

250
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,400
He should spread it evenly. The cold people are freezing.

251
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,350
Right? He's wicked, really.

252
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,100
If you say things like that, you'll be punished.

253
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,230
It's okay.

254
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,800
Ahjumma has met the Goblin couple and a grim reaper.

255
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,380
I went through a lot, so I can curse a little.

256
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,260
He tried to make me remember my past life and then tried to erase it.

257
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,700
I don't know how many people are victims of him.

258
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,280
Wouldn't oblivion be god's consideration?

259
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,880
So that you wouldn't be distraught.

260
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,990
What is he to do that? According to whose will?

261
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,120
Do you see that?

262
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,420
In my shop, even for god, water is self-serve.

263
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,130
My life is self-serve as well.

264
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,750
It's my memories and my life, so why is he doing whatever he wants without asking me? Is that consideration?

265
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,750
I'll take care of my life on my own,

266
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,570
so I really wish that guy

267
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,490
would get lost.

268
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,120
Yes. I understand.

269
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,640
What are you? What do you understand?

270
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,680
[5 years earlier]

271
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
- Be careful.
- Yes.

272
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,040
- Are you moving?
- Yes.

273
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,080
I saved money diligently.

274
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,420
But I'll still eat chicken at your place.

275
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,510
Come. I'll give you a discount.

276
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,170
You have a tough job.

277
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,900
I'll move this myself.

278
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,700
Hello. I moved into the rooftop today.

279
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,430
Nice to meet you.

280
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,120
Then, it will be "Day One" from today for us.

281
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,510
Excuse me.

282
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,050
Yes. Just a moment.

283
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,450
Sorry. I'm very sorry.

284
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,720
Orabeoni.

285
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,710
To you, who thought my oblivion...

286
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,750
To you, who thought this would make me comfortable.

287
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,340
I knew the moment our eyes met

288
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,520
that you also remember everything.

289
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,890
Because of that, in this life, we are...

290
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:45,840
I hope that you at least will have a happy ending.

291
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,630
That I have to pretend not to notice this tragedy while in our own happy endings...

292
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,900
I pray that in the next life  

293
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,280
A man for whom the wait is short and the meeting is long.

294
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,570
we would have a fate in which the wait is short and the meeting is long.

295
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,500
About my religion, I have none..

296
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,330
Did you call me ten times to say that?

297
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,820
With faces we could meet without making excuses.

298
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,840
in the one and only ardent name in the world.

299
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,980
What is this? Is this coincidence?

300
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,840
A relationship where we can run and greet each other when we meet coincidentally.

301
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,720
My awkward actions are always wrong answers.

302
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,430
I wish we could meet where everything you do is the right answer.

303
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:47,370
It was nice meeting you.

304
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,910
It's fine since I saw your face.

305
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,110
Yes.

306
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,940
Kim. Woo. Bin.

307
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,430
Sometimes, Kim Woo Bin...

308
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,640
Wang Yeo.

309
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:12,760
Sometimes, Wang Yeo. Please for a long time... stay well.

310
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,380
Why did that chicken place owner ask for Uncle down the hall's number?

311
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:42,920
And who is Ji Eun Tak whose name was on that letter? Why do I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't know?

312
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:48,010
Of course, as a chaebol, you've got to go through an episode of amnesia.

313
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,300
But... I feel like I was an important person between them.

314
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:29,840
My thoughts were short. If she forgot me, I am someone that she could forget.

315
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,120
I just missed her a lot.

316
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,780
Mister!

317
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,730
If you catch a falling maple leaf,

318
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,220
you'll fall in love with the person you are walking with.

319
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:29,690
No matter how I think about this, I really think you are a goblin. I love you..

320
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,580
Where would you find sadness that goes on for a thousand of years? Where would you find a love that goes on for a thousand years?

321
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,330
II give one vote that there is one.

322
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,100
Which side are you going to put it on? Sadness or love?

323
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:48,510
Sad love. I missed you.

324
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,430
I won't leave you here.

325
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,280
Why? Because I'm the Goblin's bride?

326
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:01,680
♬   I'll certainly find you. I'll certainly recognize you ♬

327
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,520
♬   Wherever you are. Whatever you look like   ♬

328
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,940
♬  I'll embrace you..   ♬

329
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:16,220
♬  I will certainly remember. I'll look at you   ♬

330
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,100
♬  Even at a place without you, even if many years pass by ♬

331
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,450
♬  I will not forget  ♬

332
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,140
♬ I'll retain the way you speak to the way you look   ♬

333
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,410
I miss you!

334
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,650
I miss you so much!

335
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,480
Where are you?

336
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,750
I miss you!

337
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,270
♬ I will recognize you  ♬

338
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:50,140
♬   Wherever you are. Whatever you look like   ♬

339
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,550
♬  I will embrace you ♬

340
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:59,850
♬   I'll certainly remember. I will look at you   ♬

341
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:07,210
♬  Even at a place without you, even if many years pass by, I will not forget. ♬

342
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:13,670
♬   I'll retain the way you speak to the way you look  ♬

343
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:32,710
I thought about it, but it's so fascinating. You said you would come as rain and snow.

344
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,630
And you really came as snow. On the day of the first snow.

345
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:48,550
"B will agree to appear on the summon of A 
on the first day of snow every year since A will be waiting."

346
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,200
Do you think it really was because of that contract?

347
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:06,840
I asked you so much not to leave, so how could  you go?

348
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,880
Even if that was for the best, how could you? With my hands...

349
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,990
I'm sorry.

350
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,190
You kept your promise.

351
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,510
But... what was that about returning to nothingness?

352
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,400
Not being able to see you.

353
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:34,110
I didn't know the reason but I felt like a crazy woman every time it rained.

354
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:42,170
It hurt. I cried and I muttered to myself. Medicine didn't help.

355
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:50,470
I should've confidently lived well out of consideration for the love I received, but I didn't. I'm sorry.

356
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,820
I'll make you happy from now on.

357
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:09,310
I'm saying this because you don't seem to be aware, but why do you keep touching me? Makes me feel really awkward.

358
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:17,080
To confirm. Because I feel uneasy. I'm wondering if this is a dream.

359
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,210
It's not a dream.

360
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,090
I've dreamt this kind of dream too many times.

361
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,210
It's not a dream.

362
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:01,450
I continue not to believe. I'm still really surprised. My heart is still beating fast.

363
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,850
Should I do something even more surprising?

364
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,380
I can buy you everything from there all the way to there. In one payment.

365
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,850
Woah!

366
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,140
Then alcohol. You too, Mister?

367
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,660
Sounds good.

368
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:51,500
But what to call you... "Mister" isn't fitting anymore, don't you think?

369
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:59,080
Oppa is a little strange. Well, after 10 years, we'll be the same age. How about we call each other "Hey, You" from now on?

370
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,340
No.

371
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,370
Oh yeah. What about Boss? Did you meet her?

372
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,670
From far away. By myself.

373
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,310
Boss made a lot of money so she became a building owner as well.

374
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,500
Maybe because her general brother came by. Anyway, she's doing well.

375
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,820
What about Mr. Grim Reaper? Did  you meet him?

376
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:41,860
He is still living in my house. I don't know if he's doing well, but a real friendship has been formed.

377
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,420
To be honest, it's been a long time since it formed.

378
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,840
The fate of you two...

379
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:23,160
Me, too. I missed you, too. Very much.

380
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,630
I love you. Very much.

381
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,140
You're leaving again.

382
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,050
I want to be with you more, too, Kim Shin.

383
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:50,610
I didn't get many vacation days. And since I'm human, I have to take a cab and get proof of exit and entry at the airport.

384
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,090
If I don't, I'll be in handcuffs.

385
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,780
- I'll come visit you.
 - Ah, this man...

386
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,570
Or... do you want to ride the airplane with me?

387
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,040
Wow. That's fresh.

388
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,010
You don't want to? When it's with me?

389
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:09,080
I want to, but I don't have a passport. I came here suddenly, so I couldn't prepare.

390
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:16,630
Then, see you in 17 hours in Korea. That's so long.

391
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,940
You'll be late. Let's go.

392
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,830
- One more minute. 
- One more time.

393
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,250
Did you wait a long time?

394
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:45,410
I waited 17 hours. I thought I was going to die. When the gate opened, I saw you and, "Wow!"

395
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,960
There's no angel like me, right?

396
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,670
Well, there are angels somewhere.

397
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,880
Let go of my hand. I said let go!

398
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,910
Never.

399
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,550
Did you forget your boyfriend is a Goblin?

400
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,170
This is against the rules! I'm so excited right now!

401
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:08,690
I forgot that there were always cool places behind your door.

402
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:27,640
♬  I’m wasting my word. Wasting my time  ♬

403
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:37,740
♬ I will give you everything I was feeling the moment which changes every day  ♬

404
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:46,450
♬  I felt my heart opening for you  ♬

405
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,800
Welcome.

406
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,530
Oh, PD.

407
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,090
Where's Boss?

408
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,450
You should have called. She didn't come in today.

409
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,790
I guess she must've made enough money.

410
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,070
I understand. Have a good day.

411
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,130
Where did she go? Is she busy?

412
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,670
I'm a little nervous. I shouldn't be at this age...

413
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,740
It's a long way. He'll be here soon.

414
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:56,210
Even the 70 years wouldn't have been slower then it is right now.

415
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,930
I'm too late.

416
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,540
How many years has it been since we've seen each other?

417
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:03,500
73 years.

418
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,570
It was my first birthday after we got married.

419
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,640
You said you'd come after training. You said you'd come without delay.

420
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,740
The DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) was created.

421
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:22,120
I thought... it would stop soon.

422
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,850
But it took this long.

423
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,190
Now I'm all old, I can't even put it on.

424
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,850
You're beautiful, as always.

425
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,320
While waiting for you, I aged. What's beautiful?

426
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:04,160
If... you were going to make me a wait so long, you shouldn't have said that you'd come home soon.

427
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,510
Sit down and talk. Since the tea has cooled, it looks like I have to heat it up.

428
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,150
The weather is cold.

429
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,420
Thank you.

430
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,050
I'm glad I can at least see your face like this. I have no regrets.

431
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,570
So, where are you buried?

432
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,620
Are you buried somewhere warm?

433
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,870
I'm buried in the North.

434
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:42,450
In the spring, that mountain is full of azaleas.

435
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,310
- You're home late. 
- Yeah.

436
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:52,260
An unexpected deceased came.

437
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,980
You've got an unexpected guest.

438
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,920
Mr. Grim Reaper.

439
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,580
Is it "Grim Reaper" now?

440
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,320
Miscellaneous Omitted Person.

441
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,240
It's really an unexpected development.

442
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,590
She remembers everything. She recognized me.

443
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,920
"Miscellaneous Omitted Person."

444
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,970
I haven't heard those words in such a long time. I heard everything.

445
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,840
How come you didn't  find me at least once, while knowing everything?

446
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,220
A human meeting a Grim Reaper, what is good about that?

447
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:31,400
Long time no see, Miscellaneous Omitted Person. I've listened to your radio show well.

448
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,760
It's been too awfully long to say, "Long time no see."

449
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,980
I'm already 29 years old.

450
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,650
29... I see.

451
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,610
Let's eat. Wash your hands and come.

452
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,820
- Shall I tell you a secret? 
 - Yes.

453
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,260
 You will meet a grim reaper when you are 29, too.

454
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:18,240
 Even if it's not me. That's the fate of the miscellaneously omitted. .

455
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,740
The world needs order and nine is the closest number 

456
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,240
to god's perfect number 10 and is incomplete. 

457
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,850
 Good luck with that, too. 

458
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:39,460
In the end you... met me at 29.

459
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,130
A Grim Reaper...

460
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,040
Miss Ji Eun Tak, hasn't it been a month yet?

461
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,880
Perhaps... the symptoms?

462
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,850
No. I wanted to say goodbye. Thank you so much.

463
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:04,430
Thank you. For keeping me alive.

464
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,990
I would have been truly unhappy if you hadn't.

465
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:11,880
I now remember how to be happy.

466
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:18,020
That's good. But... what is that method?

467
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:28,040
Ah...

468
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,260
The smell of meat. It looks like your taste hasn't changed.

469
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,240
I left the frying pan on the fire. Wait a second.

470
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,100
Ah. Have you eaten? If you haven't eaten, let's eat together.

471
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,210
♬ I'm getting used to  ♬

472
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,850
♬  your casual way of speaking  ♬

473
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:52,320
♬ The feeling like excitement  ♬

474
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,450
♬    is not because I like you ♬

475
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:59,120
You're holding that book from 9 years ago again.

476
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,930
Will you ever finish that book?

477
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:06,560
A man should read the same book 100 times and write it 100 times...

478
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,320
Look at you lying. Cute.

479
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,550
♬ It's confusing me ♬

480
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,290
- Does it show? 
 - Yeah.

481
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,300
♬  You, You, You. If you're still awake  ♬

482
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,370
♬  What do you think? ♬

483
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,410
♬  You, You ♬

484
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:26,180
What is this? Where is this?

485
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,110
In the covers...

486
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,500
You... are very racy. Huh?

487
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,960
If you don't like it, leave.

488
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,040
It's warm.

489
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,650
Why-Why are you doing this?

490
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,570
♬  You, You, You. If  ♬

491
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,630
Since it's warm, I'm getting sleepy.

492
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,520
♬  You and I fell the same  ♬

493
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:03,390
1. 2. 3.

494
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,350
4. 5.

495
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:08,210
What's wrong?

496
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,190
I was so scared

497
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:22,390
that all this might be a dream. That I might still be dreaming.

498
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,220
It's not a dream. You scared me so early in the morning.

499
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:34,350
From now on, appear within the count of three. Okay?

500
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,300
Don't go anywhere. Do you understand?

501
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,520
I understand. I won't go anywhere.

502
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,350
Lie down.

503
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,920
You left.

504
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,030
Sorry.

505
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,490
Over there, Oraeboni!

506
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,490
Why are you coming out of PD Ji's house and staring at my house?

507
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,020
Perhaps, that restaurant?

508
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,820
Restaurant?

509
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,890
So that's how it turns out.

510
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,800
So in the end you choose that path.

511
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,220
Since you're smiling, that's all that matters.

512
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,050
Who's smiling? Should I be smiling right now?

513
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,510
How can you be so consistent? Even though not now,

514
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,660
in the end you smiled, so it is well.

515
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:33,960
Where are you going looking like that?

516
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,000
Why are you leaving by the gate? Hey!

517
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:49,600
Please make our part-timer happy, Oraeboni.

518
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,120
Your stupid sister...

519
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,720
will be happy, too.

520
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,560
Where did you go so early in the morning?

521
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,260
Scalpel.

522
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,870
Uncle down the hall,  what is that watch? I want one.

523
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:16,640
I have to keep exact time for work, you see.

524
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,490
A grim reaper needs to have a chic black.

525
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,890
I like it. This is your breakfast. Do you like it?

526
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,910
Look at that.

527
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:27,680
Even before or now, such a careless grim reaper.

528
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,990
Do you know what you're blabbering about?

529
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,190
You just got caught by Deok Hwa.

530
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,100
You got caught by me first, Uncle.

531
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:40,220
When you came to my house, your body was in blue flame. I thought it was spontaneous combustion.

532
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,270
Such a careless goblin.

533
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:44,060
Deok Hwa,

534
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,980
it may be hard to believe, but you need to know now--

535
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,580
Know what?

536
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,200
That Uncle is a Goblin, and Uncle down the hall is a Grim Reaper?

537
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,440
How did you know?

538
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,660
We just said it aloud.

539
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,310
Ah. That's right.

540
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,780
But you, why aren't you surprised?

541
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,680
Since I was six, grandfather kept telling me.

542
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,720
I have an uncle and he's a goblin.

543
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,790
Generations of our family have served the goblin.

544
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,290
So I thought it was some kind of odd religion.

545
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,790
But I didn't imagine he was talking about a real goblin!

546
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,840
I understand. It is hard to imagine.

547
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,970
So prove it. I said prove it.

548
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,950
If both of you did it, even better.

549
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,360
How about it?

550
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,230
Good. This is first time with telekinesis, right?

551
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,880
How about this?

552
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,080
Humans can do that. Don't you know David Copperfield?

553
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,850
Get out.

554
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,800
You can't do anything else, can you?

555
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,000
First, you need to follow me.

556
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,600
Once you get there, you'll know. It's not a good place.

557
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,960
Uncle.

558
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,740
If it's your fate, it cannot be helped.

559
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,150
He was a good kid.

560
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,090
I will get revenge. I have to do it before I get attached.

561
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,060
Uncles! It's a misunderstanding.

562
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,010
I was just going to ask what will happen to NASA in the Seongbuk branch.

563
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,850
Uncles! Uncles?

564
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,170
Uncle!

565
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,060
Au-Aunt.

566
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,060
Why are you so surprised? It's not like I can't come here.

567
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,380
Do you have food?

568
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,490
You don't? I knew you would turn out like this.

569
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:56,120
Just because you earn some money, you order everything, right?

570
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,220
Come in. I'll prepare it for you.

571
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,960
You don't have to overdo it. If there's something to grill, go ahead.

572
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,250
What about Kyeong Mi and Oppa Jung Sik? Have you seen them?

573
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,120
I don't know. Those rascals. It's been a long time since I heard news from them.

574
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,140
It turned out well. It's better since those punks are gone.

575
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,740
But... you still live in this house even when you earn money?

576
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,870
Even if you were good at school, it was no use. Is this monthly or yearly rent?

577
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,220
Oh, okay. Just prepare the food quickly. You should be busy as well.

578
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:41,180
Then next time, we'll look into cases close to our lives.

579
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,670
Yes, thank you.

580
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:47,240
This has been Lawyer Kim Yoo Na for legal advice.

581
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,590
We hope you have a sensible weekend not needing the law.

582
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,550
Then after you listen to a song and a commercial,

583
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,450
we'll meet you in part 3.

584
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,820
How was I today?

585
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,060
Change your career. You did too well.

586
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,310
You weren't even listening. Why are you looking like that?

587
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,360
Do you want to have a drink?

588
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,290
No, I need to see Boss.

589
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,040
I have an appointment, too. Let's drink next time.

590
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,160
Then I'll leave first. Work hard.

591
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,280
Then, let's take care of it by this weekend.

592
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,760
Okay. I'll tell the renter that, too.

593
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,420
Yes.

594
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:58,030
Why are you like this? After going abroad one time, is this a foreign greeting?

595
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,540
Boss, I missed you.

596
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:06,500
You weren't at work or at home. What did you do all this time?

597
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,860
Preparing to move.

598
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,520
To move? Home or work?

599
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,360
Both.

600
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,590
I'm trying to overcome the new house syndrome.

601
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,240
I told you it doesn't mean that.

602
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,240
Here you go. A present from Canada.

603
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:31,090
I took it around with me all the time, just in case I ran into you.

604
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,760
So, did you find what you were looking for there?

605
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,390
All of it. Even if I tell you, you probably wouldn't believe it.

606
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,120
I even found my boyfriend.

607
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,890
In Quebec. It's fate.

608
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,220
That fate, is he handsome?

609
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,620
So seriously handsome.

610
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,790
He has clear eyes, tall, worked for the country.

611
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,350
He must be very stubborn.

612
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:59,880
Yes.

613
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:02,530
Excuse me?

614
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:08,960
I know you have no taste for guys. With that cool restaurant?

615
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,060
Later, I'll introduce you to him.

616
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,770
I really want him to meet you.

617
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,830
It's fine.

618
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,480
Huh?

619
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,320
I saw him coming down from the rooftop. Do whatever you want.

620
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,700
Why?

621
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,320
Just because. I thought of old times.

622
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,680
Okay. You think whatever you want, too.

623
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,980
Stay well and healthy.

624
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:44,980
Why are you like this? Almost as if you're never seeing me again.

625
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,680
Then goodbye. I have an appointment.

626
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,110
Okay.

627
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,040
You again.

628
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,310
I know.

629
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,450
Canadian ghost!

630
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:16,660
That man... was a ghost.

631
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:23,290
I didn't see them for a long time, so why do I see them again?

632
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,860
What are you thinking about?

633
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,350
You came? I was thinking about Canada.

634
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,950
You weren't thinking of me?

635
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:39,290
As I was thinking of Canada, of course I thought of Kim Shin.

636
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:44,010
You went there four times with your first love, you fed beef to your first love.

637
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:47,320
And you said your first love was still pretty.

638
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,620
But?

639
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:54,020
Then it led me to think that maybe I wasn't your first love.

640
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,130
But?

641
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,750
But something's just strange.

642
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,840
Then who was that first love that you met in the Joseon era?

643
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,860
It was you.

644
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,200
Lies.

645
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:14,150
Even before we met, during a time I wasn't aware of. You stayed and left.

646
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:18,300
On the 12th year of the King Cheoljong, I saw you.

647
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,970
You in the far future.

648
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:25,320
Lies.

649
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,850
Just like a lie.

650
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:34,420
That's so fascinating and exciting. It really seems like a lie.

651
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,200
All your first loves were me.

652
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,260
Oh yeah. Then that day when I summoned you on the first snow,

653
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,420
was that what the warrior Kim Shin looked like?

654
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,090
Yes.

655
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:53,990
Oh, that was it. I was really curious.

656
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:58,400
You in the times I didn't know. I saw you like that.

657
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,990
- Was it strange? 
- No, it was cool.

658
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,980
Goryeo man.

So that's why I'm saying this.

661
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,490
I'm saying this because it's a good enough day.

662
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,730
I'm saying this because you are still eye-blindingly bright.

663
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,700
I'm saying this because all of my first loves were you.

664
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:38,520
On another good enough day, will you become the bride of this Goryeo man?

That is the instinct at that moment,

683
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,850
and a pure choice of a human.
