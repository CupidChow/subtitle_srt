00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,200
When you face a moment at the brink of life and death...

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,380
be sure to pray earnestly

4
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,730
 Perhaps a god with a tender heart may be listening to you. 

5
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,590
B*stard! Aren't you going to drive properly!

6
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,210
Hyung, there.

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,790
What is this?

00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,120
- Episode 3 -

10
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,540
Who are those bastards?

11
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
Are they Men in Black?
 (Referring to the movie, Men In Black, secret organization that monitors ETs)

12
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,440
What is this?

13
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,650
H-Hey, h-hurry and g-go.

14
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,800
Hurry and step on it!

15
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,740
Step on it!

16
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,680
Mom...

17
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,380
You should get out.

18
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,320
Get your things, too.

19
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,280
Did you get hurt? Where?

20
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,270
Hurt... that is...

21
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,820
What?

22
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,380
"Did you get hurt?" How can you ask that?

23
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,980
When you sliced the car like that?

24
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,410
Wait here for a while.

25
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,410
What are you going to do?

26
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,310
Are you going to kill them?

27
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,910
You're not going to kill them, right?

28
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,830
- No. 
- You always say, "No."

29
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,100
You also came with the Grim Reaper. Do you think that man came to save me?

30
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,780
That sounds more natural.

31
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,470
Don't worry. I won't kill them. It's just to show how angry I am,

32
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,020
so that they would think that dying would be better.

33
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,810
Aigoo!

34
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,410
Save us!

35
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,370
Save us! Please save us!

36
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,480
Save us please!

37
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,640
For two days, this road will disappear on the map.

38
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,980
It means that you won't have any luck to be found by someone for two days.

39
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,150
It might hurt like you're dying but you won't die. Fortunately, the police will discover you after two days.

40
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,250
You will pay for your crime at the police station. You should be thankful that you didn't have to pay me.

41
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,840
At times, a god is hiding among those you bully.

42
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,550
Say your thanks to that child.

43
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,210
You two had a fight. That's all. You didn't see anything.

44
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:37,020
Ah. You won't be able to reconcile forever.

45
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,810
A car...

46
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,690
You didn't bring one?

47
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,980
We don't usually go around in cars.

48
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,440
Ah.

49
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,130
Perhaps...

50
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm asking, just in case.  Am I possibly dead?

51
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,740
Is this road the way to the afterlife?

52
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,630
This is just a countryside road. We just saved you earlier.

53
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,680
Then are you going to kill me now?

54
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,080
Am I captured? Alive?

55
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,970
I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?

56
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:38,540
Calm down. We are with a 19-year-old who isn't done getting mad.

57
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,870
I never knew the two of you were this close.

58
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,570
For someone who asked to be saved, what should I do when you bring along the Grim Reaper?

59
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,910
I'm asking out of curiosity. When are we going to hear, "Thank you for saving me"?

60
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,770
Keep quiet!

61
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,900
Why are you shouting?

62
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,850
Why does this road not have a single car pass by?

63
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,310
Someone made it so that no car would pass this road for two days.

64
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,100
I said keep quiet!

65
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,090
Why haven't you left yet? You said you were leaving.

66
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,940
Soon.

67
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,320
Ah. Don't mind me. I didn't ask because I was really curious.

68
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,530
I know.

69
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,810
But how did you come? I wasn't able to blow out the lighter earlier.

70
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,740
I'm not sure. I think I just heard you.

71
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,350
"Save me" or something like that.

72
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,350
I just thought to myself though.

73
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,440
Maybe you thought aloud.

74
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,710
You could have chosen not to come.

75
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,820
There was no reason not to come.

76
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,130
I'm sorry then. You came to save someone who is not even your bride in your busy schedule.

77
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,780
I did some research.

78
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,870
You were right when you said I was living on a bonus.

79
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,760
I heard you saved me and my mom 19 years ago.

80
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,940
So I'm fine being a bonus now.

81
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,200
It was thanks to being born that I was able to meet my mom,

82
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,970
so I've decided to not dislike you no.

83
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,890
- It looks like you dislike me.
- No, I don't.

84
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,020
If I met you again by any chance, I really wanted to tell you that.

85
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,850
I'm sure you wished not to meet me.

86
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,030
- I think you dislike me, for sure.
- No, I don't.

87
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,210
From now on, I won't summon you or think of you

88
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,460
and I won't do anything. So you should be rest assured and leave.

89
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,320
I hope your household stays in peace and I hope you meet a good person.

90
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,910
A pretty someone who discovers your sincere self.

91
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,620
Ah, not the face but the heart. You said you don't look at faces.

92
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,910
It's all cooked so you should eat. I will be going then.

93
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,790
Wait.

94
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,880
I didn't eat but I'm paying?

95
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,290
It was your idea to eat.

96
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,950
I also didn't eat.

97
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,420
And... I don't have money.

98
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,330
Then I'll pay. You give your time. Eat before you go.

99
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,040
Right now... are you feeding me dinner?

100
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,650
Yeah.

101
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,690
There's no way those men fed you before abducting you.

102
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,940
I don't want to. I don't want to eat with you.

103
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,640
If you want to, then pack it for me. I will thankfully accept the spicy rice cakes.

104
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,940
You do dislike me.

105
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,070
Here, Uncle, listen carefully.

106
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,960
Eun Tak lost her parents when she was young. She was abused by her aunt and her cousins.

107
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,640
Shabashaba... How much did she cry? 
 (Kid's Korean Cinderella song)

108
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,180
Who made her cry? Her aunt and those siblings.

109
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,370
There's no need to search deeply. The whole neighborhood knows about it.

110
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,670
Eun Tak's mom left an insurance payout of $150,000.

111
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,580
Since they won't be able to control the money once she becomes a legal adult, the aunt must be really abusing her.

112
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,970
Why are you looking at me like that?

113
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,550
I'm in the middle of being shocked about how useful you are.

114
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,480
A chaebol has to

115
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,330
use money and power to look into a person's background—

116
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,110
- Where did you get the pictures from? 
- I took them while on stakeout.

117
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,100
But I didn't see Eun Tak. She must be busy.

118
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,710
What is that?

119
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,050
Me. It came out nicely.

120
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,120
By the way, Uncle, why did you ask me to look into this?

121
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,840
To punish them.

122
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,920
How?

123
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,180
Uncle, are you feeling okay?

124
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,390
Is this punishment? It's gold.

125
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,200
How could you give gold as punishment?

126
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,460
- What about me?
- You worked hard.

127
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,330
Why? What about me?

128
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,280
Why can't I receive that?

129
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,250
Didn't I commit a lot of sins?

130
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,460
Aren't I deserving of a huge punishment?

131
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,800
Those bastards. Did they catch her or not? Why aren't they calling me?

132
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,840
Keep quiet, you punks! Your mother is worried sick here!

133
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,990
Just laughing?

134
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,710
That money is about to go into the bellies of those thugs.

135
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,600
You borrowed it yourself anyway.

136
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh, right. I should have starved you to death.

137
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,050
It's no different now, either.

138
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,400
Right. I was the crazy bitch.

139
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,960
What was I thinking to have two kids a year apart...

140
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,370
- What is that?
- It's gold, you bitch!

141
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,740
Wow, Ji Eun Tak. She changed all that money into gold.

142
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,300
There was a reason why she insisted there was no bank book.

143
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,570
This is why there's no bank book.

144
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,400
As soon as the sun rises, let's go to the pawnshop. Let's split it equally. Equally.

145
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,690
Just you try to pull some tricks.

146
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,340
This bastard... I'm your mom!

147
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,830
Give it to me.

148
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,860
Let go! Let go!

149
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Mom! Wake up! That bitch Kyeong Mi ran with the gold!

150
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,890
That crazy bitch!

151
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,230
Why is the line busy the whole time?

152
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,090
I know. The line is busy now.

153
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,560
With which bastard is she talking to?

154
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,670
She's talking to this bastard! Hang up!

155
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,500
Hurry! Hurry and grab a taxi!

156
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,900
Taxi! Taxi!

157
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,580
- I'm in a hurry. 
 - Get out of the way. Move!

158
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,880
Mister, go!

159
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,510
Yes, Grandfather, Uncle is eating...

160
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,360
He has a spoonful and I even put some kimchi on for him.

161
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,230
Seollongtang (beef bone soup).

162
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,540
Yes, yes.

163
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,130
But, Grandfather, about the card... Hello?

164
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,040
Hello?

165
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,250
Honestly, if you could just say a word then this problem...

166
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,240
Uncle, are you listening?

167
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,160
What are you watching? What?

168
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,280
Television.

169
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,890
He's a pitiful person. I should not be getting mad at such a pitiful person, a 3rd generation chaebol.

170
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,960
He was exactly at that age.

171
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,380
Who was?

172
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,100
The king I protected.

173
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,700
He was 17 years old.

174
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,540
You protected a king? Awesome!

175
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,020
Uncle, were you a Nae-si, by chance?
(Nae-si means eunuch - sounds like four-o-clock)

176
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,140
No, I was an Oh-si. 
(between 11 to 1)

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,080
He's a pitiful person, Deok Hwa. He needs your help now.

178
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,000
The most splendid hour of the day.

179
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,840
I was blinded

180
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,670
and ceaselessly blamed someone.

181
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,900
Was it the king or god?

182
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,460
Or myself?

183
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,040
I forgot that.

184
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,750
Is it him?

185
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,270
What?

186
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,960
My rage of 1,000 years. The reincarnation of the king that killed me.

187
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
Look closely.

188
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,710
Did he get reincarnated?

189
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,090
I don't know. If he's reincarnated, he'll be just that age.

190
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,310
Eunuch. Eunuch. Your Highness. Eunuch.

191
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,070
Forget him. The hatred and sense of revenge is making you miserable...

192
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,790
Then are you happy because you can't remember?

193
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,180
I can't know by just looking. I need to touch him to know.

194
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,340
- What is?
- How am I supposed to utilize you?

195
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,230
What can you find out with touching?

196
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,370
Then again, why do you think he would be reincarnated as a man?

197
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,080
- Is it her?
- I can't know with just watching. I need to touch to know.

198
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,060
What happens if you touch? What?

199
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,740
It's her! Say that it's her. I'm prepared to forgive.

200
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,230
- I thought it was a rage of 1,000 years.
- He must have had his reasons.

201
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,560
As you know a rage is everywhere then nowhere... Where are you going?

202
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,390
What happens if you touch? Why are you only talking among yourselves?

203
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,790

Greetings, Senior. I'm Grim Reaper Kim of '23 class.

207

You're working hard. Sit down.

208
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,050
Yes, we will work hard.

Class of '22, Reaper Kim.

212
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,970
- Rest.
- Yes, we will work hard.

213
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,740
You're here. By the way, Seniors,

214
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,260
why aren't you checking the company email? You know the miscellaneously omitted persons?

215
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,280
It's been approved and they've made a task force.

216
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,780
I hope you submit the list before the end of the year.

217
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,950
I don't have any. You've got two, right?

218
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,670
Who says? Who said I have two?

219
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,540
Everyone says you have two.

220
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,600
- I'll submit it soon. 
- I'd appreciate that.

221
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,110
It's time for me to go now.

222
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,710
I'll see you at the winter workshop.

223
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,120
Aigoo, work hard.

224
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,210
That's her. Her.

225
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,170
Greetings, Seniors. I'm Reaper Kim of class of '23.

226
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,040
- Ah, yes. 
 - Nice to meet you all.

227
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,290
Go on.

228
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,810
So pretty.

229
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,810
She should be an angel. Why is she a grim reaper?

230
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,110
Her class is so excited because of her.

231
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,340
You are the one who's so excited because of her from our class.

232
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,970
Move out of the way!

233

Oppa! Oppa!

Are you alright?

235
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,970
Then I will be going now.

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,180
Bye.  And also,

237
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,410
we have a company dinner at the end of the month.

238

It's a relief.

you wouldn't know.

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,170
Really?

319
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,590
What do you mean, really, Young Woman?

320
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,810
What do you say when someone asks you to cosign? "No."

321
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,500
When someone says, "This jade heating pad is nice," then what do you say?

322
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,050
"I don't want it." What if someone asks to buy you snacks?

323
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,680
"Get lost."

324
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,960
Pay for the book. $10.

325
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,110
How much longer do I have to sit here?

326
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,170
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,240
But...

328
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,760
this book should be considered a used book, no?

329
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,390
No, I won't.

330
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,740
Get lost.

331
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,470
Uncle!

332
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,290
G- G- Grandfather.

333
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,030
I came to see how he was doing on my way from the dry cleaners.

334
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,510
But then, I see there is a guest.

335
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,530
Ah. A g-guest...

336
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,130
Who are you?

337
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,230
What brings you...

338
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,640
to my uncle's house?

339
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,490
I am... that person's friend. I came to visit.

340
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,930
Ah! You came to visit your friend.

341
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,540
You must be a very close friend of my uncle's.

342
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,530
Because Uncle is going overseas,

343
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,870
you must have came to have a farewell party.

344
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,730
Farewell.

345
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,780
I hope you stay healthy. Don't ever come back.

346
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,330
I hope you stay there happily ever after.

347
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,970
Farewell to you. You and I aren't close.

348
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,590
Hurry and get out of my house. Don't ever come back.

349
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,150
Uncle, why are you acting this way?

350
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,720
To your really, really close friend.

351
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,950
Do you think this doesn't go for you?

352
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,120
You leave also. Really, really quickly.

353
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,190
Wow. How could he do that? Isn't he so mean?

354
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,650
Tell me about it.

355
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,900
Right? How could he kick me out, too?

356
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,720
Would a real uncle really do that to me?

357
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,830
- He will be going soon.
- That should be the case.

358
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,080
If not, you will be the one to go.

359
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,480
Somewhere.

360
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,400
That place isn't somewhere good, right?

361
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,700
- Come in. 
 - No thanks.

362
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,280
- No matter how much you plead...
- Not you.

363
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,500
You go to your own house to get scolded.

364
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,040
1-0.

365
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,510
Me? Get scolded? Why would I be scolded?

366
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,730
Did you tell Grandpa everything by any chance?

367
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,660
Wow! So petty!

368
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,600
How much did you tell him? I should know so that I can match things up.

369
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,810
Did you match with me when you put the house up for rent?

370
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,780
I can't go. Where would I go?

371
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,040
I will die here.

372
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,660
Oh, yeah.

373
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,530
Good night 1:1

374
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,190
Good Night 1:1. 

375
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,700
Horse... It's horse blood, right?

376
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,420
Hey! Grim Reaper! Aren't you going to clean this up?

377
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,400
Hey! I'm sorry! Clean this up.

378
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,910
Yes?

379
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,310
You...

380
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,230
Did you sleep here?

381
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,070
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you but I keep missing the right time.

382
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,580
I'm really sorry.

383
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,090
How did you know?

384
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,570
I don't brush my teeth in the store.

385
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,830
I have more proof.

386
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,090
Boss, to be honest,

387
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,140
I sleep in the store.

388
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:59,340
Boss, can I inconvenience you a bit?

389
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,980
Boss, I'm sleeping in the shop for now. 

390
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,880
As that's my situation for now. 

391
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,820
I stayed here well. 

392
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,420
I got kicked out of the house. Please save me.

393
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,250
- I'm sorry.
- Is it because of your aunt?

394
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,170
That's one reason.

395
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,380
-Then one thing led to another. 
 - Understood.

396
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,330
Aren't you going to ask more?

397
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,440
Why ask more? It's not like I'll resolve it for you.

398
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,010
I'm just doing what I can do.

399
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,270
Here, your pay for one week.

400
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,310
I will pay you weekly. Why?

401
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,210
If I give it to you monthly, you might not get it.

402
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,370
Even if you do sleep here, go to the sauna and wash up

403
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,630
and get some shikhye (Korean rice drink).

404
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,660
Thank you.

405
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,480
If you're that thankful to receive what you deserve, people will look down on you.

406
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,300
Not for the money,

407
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,710
but I am thankful for your coolness.

408
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,670
That money is cool, part-timer.

409
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,970
Go and wash up. Grill one squid for me before you go.

410
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,780
Are you going to drink?

411
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,500
No, just the squid. I don't even put my lips near alcohol.

412
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,220
- Because I get drunk if I drink too much.
- Excuse me?

413
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,660
No! No! Cancel that!

414
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,260
You must have been reading a book.

415
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm always reading and have profound knowledge in music and paintings.

416
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,170
I'm sorry for disturbing your reading.

417
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,330
I know. Why are you disturbing me? You said you won't be calling me.

418
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,260
I didn't. It was a mistake.

419
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,140
While grilling the squid, the leg caught on fire and I blew it.

420
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,060
Was it tasty?

421
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,480
Why are you here? Haven't you left yet?

422
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,650
I was packing my things. I was packing my books. Always books first.

423
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,920
Well then, since I need to finish packing...

424
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,810
- Wait... 
- You always talk to me when I'm about to go.

425
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,180
It's you who's always leaving when I'm about to say something.

426
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,510
- I have something I'm curious about.
- I'm not giving you $5,000 (oh baek).

427
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,250
That startled me. I heard it as you won't confess. ( TN "confess" and "five hundred"are homonyms).

428
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,290
It's because you always say things that are non-sequiturs.

429
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,650
From where did it start to be my fault?

430
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,680
From there. From where I should see something.

431
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,520
So what exactly should I be seeing?

432
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,580
In order for me to have effective value to you.

433
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,480
Are you going to say you see it if I tell you?

434
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,240
No. Even if I see it I'm going to say I don't.

435
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,500
If I see that, what if you start treating me better?

436
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,020
What if you give me $5,000, buy me meat or ask me if I want anything?

437
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,210
Then it would be very tiring for me. I really don't like you.

438
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,670
It's my first time hearing that.

439
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,670
Really! Really! It's my first time hearing that. Where are you looking at when an adult is talking to you?

440
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,120
Don't answer if you don't want to.

441
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,250
Don't you see something unique?

442
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,240
Something that looks very painful.

443
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,840
Ah that....

444
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,410
- You see? 
- I thought it was something great.

445
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,330
Goodbye. I'm busy so I will get going.

446
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,470
Hey, do you want to eat meat? Do you have something you want to have?

447
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,180
- $5,000.
- You said you were busy. Hurry up and go.

448
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,840
Then meat. This way.

449
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,180
It's the last piece of meat. Do you see it?

450
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,980
Yes. It looks really tasty.

451
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,680
Thank you for the meal.

452
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,050
I'm asking if you see it? You don't see it, right?

453
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,730
Are you getting mad at me right now?

454
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:17,080
- Did it sound like that?
- Yes.

455
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:22,410
I'm sorry. I was going to ask

456
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:26,540
what you think about fresh fruit juice for dessert but the tone of my voice went up a little high, didn't it?

457
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,790
Fresh fruit juice?

458
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,540
What do you want to drink? You can order an expensive one.

459
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,880
I'm full though. This one, large size.

460
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,330
You aren't full.

461
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,580
Me, too. The same one.

462
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,380
I will help you with the bill.

463
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,350
She says she's ready to check you out.

464
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,700
I won't pay for his.

465
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:59,280
What's with you? You said you don't like fruit because it's vulgar.

466
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,760
What's with you? Is there someone you will kill in here?

467
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,030
I'm a regular here.

468
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,380
Is it me? The one that will die here today?

469
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,130
Was I lured by the beef

470
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,560
and ambushed by the juice? And you two are on the same side?

471
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,040
It's a misunderstanding. Actually, I am on the same side as you.

472
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,740
You see the sword. You see the sword.

473
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,710
You will pull that sword out.

474
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,520
What are you doing?

475
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,910
What do you mean? Why are you on the same side as me?

476
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,130
What is she? Why isn't she falling for it?

477
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,130
She goes beyond all your expectations.

478
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,940
That means the documents I'll have to file will be no joke.

479
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,330
Then, have a good time. I have prior appointments.

480
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,300
He really must have came just to drink juice. That's something new.

481
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,000
But then, why did he say he was on the same side as me?

482
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,680
It's the matters with the gods. You don't need to know.

483
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,750
But then, isn't that mister uselessly handsome?

484
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,210
Was it because people will follow the handsome ones better, that they only chose handsome ones for work purposes?

485
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,790
Are all grim reapers handsome?

486
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,720
You call that handsome?

487
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,840
Yes! That is handsome.

488
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,900
Then what about me?

489
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,650
Mister... you're just some.

490
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,710
Enough. You are full.

491
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,840
Oh, that mister is also handsome. This must be the place to be.

492
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:01,320
I will be there soon. See you soon. I love you.

493
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,510
Honey, I miss you so I will be there quick.

494
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,690
What are you doing?

495
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,210
Something anyone wishes for.

496
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,180
Are you alright?

497
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,880
Magic.

498
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,340
Oh my. I'm sorry.

499
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,860
I'll untie it.

500
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,830
Yes?

501
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,820
-  Ahh! 
 - What's wrong?

502
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,120
I'm so sorry.

503
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,640
- No. 
- It's untangled.

504
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,350
Are you alright?

505
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Yes. Today is a really strange day.

506
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,980
It's like magic.

507
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,190
That's why I'm asking, do you have a boyfriend?

508
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,330
No. My family's very strict.

509
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,300
So they were strict.

510
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,800
Do you have a girlfriend?

511
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,110
I've been single since birth, because I was waiting for you.

512
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,180
Kiss. Kiss.

513
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,820
Kiss!

514
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,830
Is being a Cupid your side job?

515
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,900
That was that, right? Guardian angel, that.

516
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,480
1 or 2 people in a 100 years, are born with the same face from a previous life.

517
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,150
So, I know that man's previous life.

518
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,190
That woman was not to lose that man.

519
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,370
Wow. What was his past life?

520
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,850
Was he the man who saved a country that I have only heard about?

521
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:23,650
He was a supervisor who was worse than the landlord that extorted his tenant farmers.

522
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,610
Then why did you help? Are you also being a guardian angel for bad guys?

523
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,990
How can you do that? You make nice people lose hope.

524
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:37,660
I'm not their guardian god, but rather the guardian god of the man and woman those two just lost.

525
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,790
 I love you.

526
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,250
I love you, too.

527
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,450
I miss you so I will hurry over.

528
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,360
Don't hurry, just slow down or else you'll get hurt. Okay?

529
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,210
Wow!

530
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,640
The man is a liar and a coward,

531
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,550
and the woman is vain and ungrateful.

532
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,230
Now, those two will be each other's hell.

533
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,500
Wow. That's pretty cool.

534
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:05,340
I make those magic-like moments for humans once in a while.

535
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:12,410
But then, from earlier, why are you talking like in historical dramas?

536
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:16,560
Just when I thought I figured you out.

537
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,820
Of course. Is my life like this

538
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,090
because I committed a huge sin in my past life?

539
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,090
Is it my punishment to be born as the goblin's bride?

540
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,880
I don't know what you did in your past life. It's still too early to discuss at 19 years of age your present life.

541
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,050
And you are not the goblin's bride.

542
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,460
You're not falling for it.

543
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,960
My life's been full of lots of misery and hardships, but I like my life, too.

544
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,770
I received a lot of love from my mom. I now have an umbrella.

545
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,370
And it's nice to have met you.

546
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,600
It was nice. It's in past tense.

547
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:06,400
You also have grudges. You haven't answered whether you see it or not.

548
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,960
Do you see it or not?

549
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,180
My mom said this. A person needs to recognize where he's supposed to lay down before stretching out his legs

550
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,840
and know when it's time to leave.

551
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,840
You understand what I mean, right?

552
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,790
I don't.

553
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,970
It means we end here.

554
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,200
I will be going this way. Goodbye.

555
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,300
♬   Through the endless daydream I saw you on the way back  ♬

556
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:59,620
♬  There I walk with you in my arms   ♬

557
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:07,140
♬  Through the blurry darkness was veiling on the twilight  ♬

558
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,260
♬  We've been far away from my fears   ♬

559
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:21,930
♬  Somewhere I will see you with the days like a blossom  ♬

560
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,200
♬  Blooming all around you so bright   ♬

561
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:39,140
Wow. That's pretty cool.

562
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,040
Wow. That's pretty cool.

563
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,430
Uncle, you looked like a painting just now. What about the uncle down the hall?

564
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,300
- Not yet.
- Well, he must be working overtime.

565
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,010
Uncle, you know, I should become a grim reaper like the uncle down the hall, when I die.

566
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,320
If you open the last room in the hallway of life, there is death, isn't it?

567
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,190
And the one to greet you is the uncle down the hall.

568
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,890
Wake up. There's no chance for you with your sin.

569
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:09,220
I'd hate to tell you this, but in order to become a grim reaper you need to commit a huge sin...

570
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,250
Huge sin? What kind of huge sin?

571
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,330
How did you know?

572
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,030
Wow!  Awesome! Is he really a murderer?

573
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,310
Wow! You can never know with a person's face.

574
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:22,590
Not that. How did you know he was a grim reaper?

575
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,630
Uncle, don't you feel like your question is a bit late?

576
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:32,030
That time, when you were depressed and you were creating clouds and whatnot in the living room. When the uncle down the hall came in, I was so nervous.

577
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,030
But then that uncle didn't even flinch.

578
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,210
- What's wrong with him?
- I was there when you were talking about grim reaper's foresight and all that.

579
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,640
Grim Reaper who's saying all sorts of things in front of the kid.

580
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,090
I hope you don't look down upon the grim reaper's foresight.

581
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:48,890
Was that all? His face is all white and such red lips and wears all black clothes.

582
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:53,630
I thought he was some celebrity. Then I will be going then.

583
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,610
You. How did you know I was a grim reaper?

584
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,870
How could I not know when you're like this? A person who was there is now here!

585
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:20,660
Please be careful! Both of you are so careless and naive.

586
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,160
I got caught because of you. A goblin who talks behind others' back.

587
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,380
Look at how you look, if it's because of me.

588
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,670
A Grim Reaper who might've been a murderer in his past life!

589
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,460
And you're being punished like this because you haven't killed a single ant!

590
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,680
Tsk.

591
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,010
He must be really hurt. What should we do?

592
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:00,950
Don't you see that I'm not all that inclined either?

593
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,950
A big sin?

594
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:20,020
Unfilial, disloyal, immodest, unrestricted, unvirtuous.

595
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,350
Let's not go that far. It probably wasn't.

596
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,940
No. It wasn't.

597
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,490
What? Why are you here?

598
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:41,150
A responsible action. An effort to be a better person. Most would call it an apology.

599
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,390
I was too much earlier. I'm sorry.

600
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,600
Among these, what was I not?

601
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,000
- Unfilial? 
- Get out.

602
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,990
I was also too much just now. I thought you would laugh.

603
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,790
Get out.

604
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,720
What's so important about the past life?

605
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,900
It's not important to me what you did or what you were in the past life.

606
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:03,450
- Really?
- Yeah. Because whatever you were, it's unchanging about how I don't like you.

607
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,960
I can't laugh.

608
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,610
Even when they first met, I thought Uncle would kick out the uncle down the hall.

609
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:20,030
But on the contrary they are cozily getting along well.

610
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,570
One person is miserable from forgetting the past life

611
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,670
and one person is miserable for not forgetting the past life.

612
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,670
Those two's existences are relying on each other.

613
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,560
We are just...

614
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,010
people who are briefly passing in their long life.

615
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,750
I see.

616
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,530
Wait, you already knew, too?  Jeez, those uncles.

617
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,170
I worry they might get detected outside.

618
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,510
You just worry about yourself.

619
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,720
Stretch your arms out. Stretch your back, too.

620
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,690
No way I am your real grandson.

621
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:08,020
You would never treat your real grandson like this.

622
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,880
- I'm going to take revenge.
- You jerk!

623
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:42,390
As you already know, this is the building I got for my 8th birthday.

624
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,040
I do know. What did you get for your 9th birthday?

625
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,830
I received dislike. But that was all in the past.

626
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,720
- And now as I grew to be an adult... 
- You are still being disliked, I'm sure you know.

627
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,780
Since you use the card a lot without consideration.

628
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,770
So you canceled it, Secretary Kim.

629
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,710
So I'm telling you this. I'm trying to find out how to get cash using this building.

630
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,880
So start with vacating shops in a good spot. Make it smooth.

631
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,280
First, start with this chicken place that's out of business.

632
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,080
There's something you need to know first. First,

633
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,800
that chicken place has a sign that says "closed" which means it's closed, not out of business.

634
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:21,730
Second, we didn't come together. I tailed you, by the order of the chairman.

635
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:27,130
What kind of a tailing is so open... Well, I thought we came together.

636
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,000
Let's do this then. Soon, a phone call will come to the secretary's office. A woman will ask this.

637
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,120
If I work there. Then you can just tell her I do work there. That's it.

638
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,640
But you don't.

639
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,420
Secretary Kim is seriously... working so upright.

640
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,510
My grandpa must feel so reassured.

641
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:54,410
I need to apply for a new credit card. Please? Just once?

642
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,180
Where are you going?

643
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,170
- Supermarket. 
- Supermarket?

644
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,380
Your repertoire is getting more and more insincere.

645
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,140
You don't see that I'm carrying a shopping tote?

646
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,670
I didn't know it was a shopping tote.

647
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,780
How can you actually follow me? You don't trust me?

648
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,640
Have you made yourself trustworthy?

649
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,090
You were going to go to her but since I was going to follow you, you came to the supermarket.

650
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:43,520
Last time at the cafe, too. You came to get her there but you got caught by me.

651
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,740
I'm not going to take her away. I'm totally rooting for her now.

652
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,920
Why are you rooting for her?

653
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,820
I'm really on the same team as her. You will die if the bride pulls the sword, right?

654
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,810
Going forever is better than going abroad, right?

655
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:03,180
She can't see the sword right this moment, 
but I want to believe in the miracle that one day she might.

656
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,420
I'm wagered my life on that day.

657
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,500
There are lots of people watching here.

658
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,010
Alright. Just promise me one thing.

659
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,780
What, suddenly? What promise?

660
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,610
That you won't touch that kid if I leave.

661
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,010
Really? You're really leaving?

662
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,360
However,

663
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,320
the moment you try to take her away, I will come straight back to that house.

664
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,750
So leave her alone.

665
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,380
When are you leaving?

666
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,200
The day after tomorrow. Happy?

667
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,190
You weren't detected?

668
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,270
How can you come to the house? If my aunt finds out, we're all dead. Did they see you?

669
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,250
My aunt's family is asleep?

670
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,110
I don't know.

671
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:49,570
You scared me.

672
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,400
But what brings you to my house?

673
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,560
To see me?

674
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,460
Should I?

675
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,290
What did you say?

676
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,460
I guess I thought of you. Briefly.

677
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,630
So I guess I came to see you.

678
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,330
Why?

679
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:20,720
I'm not a bride and I'm not pretty.

680
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,820
You keep having to save my life and I'm just a pest to you.

681
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,570
Why would you come see me?

682
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,320
I guess I wanted to see this.

683
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,070
Now that I saw it, I'll leave. Your aunt's family disappeared.

684
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,530
The house is vacant, so you can go in.

685
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,520
My aunt's family's disappeared? Really? When?

686
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,940
Why did you come if you didn't know?

687
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:53,020
Oh, I left something here, so I came to get it.

688
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,830
What?

689
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,970
Just something.

690
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,640
You don't need to know.

691
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,790
Alright then.

692
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,840
I'm leaving then.

693
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,260
♬  I'll be by your side    ♬

694
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,460
♬   It's beautiful life   ♬

695
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,600
♬    I'll stand behind you  ♬

696
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,860
♬    Beautiful love  ♬

697
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,900
♬   Your memory, your scent    ♬

698
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:49,490
♬  It's getting erased one at a time    ♬

699
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:53,990
♬  It's a beautiful life, beautiful day ♬

700
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:58,440
♬  I'll live in your memory  ♬

701
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,360
♬   Beautiful life, beautiful day  ♬

702
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,190
♬  In your memory, ♬

703
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,090
♬   beautiful my love   ♬

704
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,330
Excuse me. Oppa in black.

705
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,030
Don't you need a hairpin?

706
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,760
I don't prefer hairpins.

707
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,300
Then buy one for your lover.

708
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,240
I don't have a lover.

709
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,530
A lover, you could have then not have.

710
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,250
But this, once you buy it, you'll always have it.

711
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:32,580
See it in a mirror once, Oppa.

712
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,430
How much is this?

713
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,530
I grabbed it first... You're crying because of it?

714
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,680
What?

715
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,750
Want me to concede to you?

716
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,350
I don't want to for free though.

717
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,430
If you give me your phone number.

718
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,020
I don't have that kind of stuff.

719
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,200
You don't have a cellphone?

720
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,840
Are you poor?

721
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,830
I don't really have a need for a cellphone.

722
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,590
Are you sure it's not because you don't want to give me your number?

723
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,490
Concession, cancelled.

724
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:07,300
Give me your number. Write it down and leave it here, with the ring.

725
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:14,190
First, let's exchange our names. You'll need to know my name to call me.

726
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:16,030
Nice to meet you.

727
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,100
I'm Sunny.

728
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:31,210
Seon Hyo?

729
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,300
If you like that better, go with that. It's just a nickname so it doesn't really matter.

730
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,090
Card?

731
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,920
Cash?

732
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,560
Who's going to pay?

733
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,830
It doesn't matter who pays.

734
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:04,430
Both will end up paying a very expensive price anyway.

735
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,520
I...

736
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:49,760
came late.

737
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:12,290
I'm fine. 

738
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:17,580
If this is our last moment, it is also my fate. 

739
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:24,930
So go. Don't stop and go to the king, General. 

740
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,810
You're really going to be like this?

741
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:59,160
I heard you're not even the goblin bride. Just come with me then.

742
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,290
You bitch.

743
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:06,160
You won't listen to me, right? Fine, I'm just wandering alone so you be alone, too.

744
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,470
I'm going to harass all those people you know.

745
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,700
I'm going to kill that woman first.

746
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:22,330
The &+### shoe! I'll just &#@_!

747
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:25,760
Scary. Hey, that woman's scary.

748
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,110
Boss, are you alright?

749
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:30,700
Be honest.

750
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:35,560
Is my beauty gone these days? I totally got the vibe though.

751
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,640
He should totally be calling by now and then some. Why isn't he?

752
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,800
Oh, the ring? That man?

753
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,290
- First, please calm... 
- I can't calm down.

754
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:47,070
He's the best-looking man I've ever seen.

755
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,620
Do you see how hard I work? How I drink this everyday for good skin?

756
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,140
But why isn't he calling?

757
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:59,570
Good-looking men always tend to act like good-looking men. Just forget him.

758
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:01,640
How can I forget?!

759
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,320
He's the only man that ever conceded to me.

760
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:13,200
The ring was pretty though. It seemed perfect for me.

761
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,020
Do you have a pen? 

762
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,130
I don't. Just tell me. 

763
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,010
That was kind of funny. 

764
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,400
Are you an engineer?

765
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,080
The finish of a phone number is the lips, right? 

766
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,000
Careful.

767
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,690
Hello.

768
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,900
What's all this? Is my family moving?

769
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,470
You're not in touch with your aunt? Your aunt put the house for sale.

770
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:48,600
A new family is moving in the day after tomorrow but nothing's ready so I'm suffering here.

771
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,190
She put it up for sale?

772
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:54,020
What about me then?

773
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,570
What about me then?

774
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:00,730
Why are you asking me? You need to ask your aunt that. Your aunt took all the deposit money.

775
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,290
If you have something to take, take it.

776

Timing and Subtitles by The Immortal Team @viki.com

777
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,300
Lovers.

778
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,250
Ji Eun Tak.

779
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:14,040
Take out everything that's in that bag and your pockets.

780
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,690
Quickly.

781
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,210
Teacher, this...

782
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:43,900
Quiet. I see you have all sorts of stuff for fire.

783
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,780
How about cigarettes? You haven't taken out cigarettes, is that your last conscience?

784
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,590
Teacher, I really had a reason for this. I don't smoke cigarettes.

785
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,550
The kids said they saw you smoking.

786
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,680
Let's get it over quickly, shall we?

787
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,700
Hold out your hand.

788
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,450
Quickly.

789
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,240
Both of your hands.

790
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:18,370
Look at how thorough you are.

791
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:21,640
This is why smart kids are scary.

792
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,990
Ji Eun Tak, I find it very scary when kids like you are good at studying.

793
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:35,590
You act nice and pitiful in front of me but you'll act completely different behind me.

794
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,780
It's kids like you that cause trouble once in society.

795
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:45,710
And then the truly good people will be the ones who pay for it, okay, Eun Tak?

796
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,120
Thanks.

797
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,320
Why alcohol all of a sudden?

798
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,570
What about you? Where does drinking suddenly take you?

799
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:24,170
The more the better when it comes to wine, women and meat. I've been plenty faithful when I was a general.

800
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,440
You were a general?

801
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,040
If it was back then, someone like you wouldn't even be able to talk to me. How dare you?

802
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,120
You don't know what I was.

803
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,050
What were you?

804
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,780
Your luggage... (TN Jim eun; how a king said "I" but also a homonym for luggage)

805
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:41,670
See how you bluff. What?  You were a king?

806
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,410
Have you packed all your stuff?

807
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:48,630
Ah, my stuff... Well, I don't have much to pack.

808
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:53,000
Go safely.

809
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:55,980
- I'll phone. 
 -You know I don't have a phone.

810
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:58,040
That's why I said it.

811
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:47,570
What are you doing? It's driving me crazy. Are you really like that after one can of beer?

812
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,170
- I don't know where she is. 
 - Who?

813
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:54,240
She's not summoning me. Since she's not summoning me I can't find her.

814
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,890
I thought I was omniscient and there was nothing I couldn't do, but...

815
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,620
I can't even find her.

816
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,520
All the stuff I have is all just useless.

817
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,770
That's true. It's good for just eating and playing.

818
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:14,210
Then, what did you do before?

819
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,980
I found her, like this, every time.

820
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,270
Just phone her.  Wouldn't she have a phone?

821
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:26,050
Yeah, I don't know her number.

822
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,180
Now it's best if I don't know.

823
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,030
He found her.

824
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:17,060
Mom, are you doing well?

825
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:25,290
Mom, did you go to heaven?

826
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,260
♬ And I'm here ♬

827
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,080
How is heaven?

828
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,000
Is it better than here?

829
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,200
♬ Just like I used to be ♬

830
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:42,570
Mom, I...

831
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,210
♫We were here  ♫

832
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:49,400
Mom, I'm...

833
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,670
♫in old days  ♫

834
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:53,660
not doing so well.

835
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,600
♫With you with me  ♫

836
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,640
No one asks how I'm doing.

837
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:15,570
Again? I'm sick of this. My raining life.

838
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:30,070
♬ And I'm here, home, home with you. ♬

839
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,750
♬ With me. ♬

840
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,620
It's because I'm depressed.

841
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,120
About what?

842
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:12,100
The rain. It'll stop soon.

843
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,010
When you are depressed, it rains?

844
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,400
Yes.

845
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:22,510
Then when there's a typhoon, how depressed are you?

846
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:25,180
That's not me, but the earth's depressed.

847
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:30,150
Have you been well?

848
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:38,970
The rain's about to stop.

849
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,670
My mood just got better.

850
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,770
I didn't summon you though.

851
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,550
Yes, you didn't summon me.

852
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,450
I've been busy as well, here and there.

853
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,640
I've also had a lot to do.

854
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,900
- Now it's going to be a problem. 
 - What?

855
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:10,990
Now every time it rains,

856
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,930
I'll think that you must be depressed.

857
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:18,290
When I'm already so busy not having anyone to depend on, I'll have to worry about you, too.

858
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:24,250
Aren't you cold? Why are you here like this?

859
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,820
Because I'm unhappy.

860
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,140
Now it just feels like a cold.

861
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,890
- What? 
 - My misfortunes.

862
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:42,850
It finds me just when I'm about to forget and I contract it when it comes time.

863
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,040
Well, I didn't say it to bother you.  
 (TN The word for 'bother' and 'stab'  are homonyms.

864
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,370
You're not saying that because you know something, right?

865
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:54,200
Well, I guess there is something bothering you.

866
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,860
Stop saying it. The word that I hate the most is that.

867
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,720
Well, then I chose really well!

868
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,000
Keep going with what you're saying.

869
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,940
I expect you won't be able to hear it without tears.

870
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,980
I'll try to bear it.

871
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:25,110
Do you perhaps know that saying?  'To humans, there are four stages of life.'

872
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:28,690
"The stage of sowing the seeds, the stage of watering the sown seeds,"

873
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,900
"the stage of harvesting the watered seeds, and the stage of using the harvested seeds."

874
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,850
How do you know that? That's what the reaper says to the dead.

875
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,710
It's my 19th year as a goblin bride, you know.

876
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:45,810
I heard what the ghosts were saying. So it's really unfair.

877
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:51,270
Why is my life always 1-1, 1-2?

878
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,290
I can't get past the second stage.

879
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,630
Mourn.

880
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,920
To a kid?

881
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,310
Then?

882
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:07,780
There's lots. Tap on the shoulder. Pat my hair. Give $5000?

883
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,580
Ah, gosh.  What about your hands?

884
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:15,260
My hands, since they do a lot of work, have to rest a bit.

885
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:20,900
Well.. I need to save them for when I receive important things, like a wad (of cash).

886
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,430
What? Why?

887
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:25,540
Forget it.

888
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,830
Present.

889
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:46,360
It's pretty, right?

890
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,560
- It is pretty. 
 - It is right?

891
01:16:57,410 --> 01:17:00,720
♬ It's a beautiful life ♬

892

01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:20,850
What did you just do?

897
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:24,910
Patted your head. 
 ♬ If I am with you under the same sky ♬

898
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:29,740
That's my goodbye. I'm leaving tomorrow.

906
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,380
Your luggage? 
 (TN:  Korean words for "luggage" and the royal "I" are homonyms)

907
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,070
You already asked me earlier.

908
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:15,950
I just want to keep hearing it. It makes me happy.

909
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:21,570
- You've got a text message. 
 - No, that's the sound of the doorbell.

910
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:24,100
It's the first time in 60 years.

911
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,770
Yeah... What?

912
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,710
What did I just say?

913
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,740
None of us pushed the doorbell.

914
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,050
Why are you being scary like that?

915
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:46,310
- Go see through. 
 - I can't.

916
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:49,690
And you're proud of it? What kind of Grim Reaper can't see through?

917
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,210
How about you?

918
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,790
Oh, jeez.

919
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:02,620
Isn't this the goblin's residence?

920
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:06,330
This is my house. Did you come to see me? Me?

921
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,090
Do you have an appointment with me?

922
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:11,750
No, I found the wrong place-

923
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:19,240
Did you even give her your address?

924
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:25,600
What are you doing here? How did you know to come here?

925
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,090
I asked the ghosts where the goblin's house is.  But why is that Grim Reaper at your house...?

926
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:34,780
I guess a couple fight is going on.  Well, whatever, sort it out between you.

927
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,210
Since I'm in the middle of being upset.

928
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,620
Do the two of you live together?

929
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,730
So far. Why did you come?

930
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:52,060
There was something I didn't have the chance to say. You know about asking me what I see.

931
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,760
What happens if can see it?

932
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,230
Why are you asking? You can't see it anyway.

933
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,380
Who says I can't see it?

934
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,570
One, if I see it, does it mean we have to get married straight away?

935
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:09,670
Two, if I see it, will you give me $5000? Three, if I see it...

936
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,500
will you not leave?

937
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:24,650
Please don't go. Just stay here, in Korea.

938
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,720
Can you not?

939
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:38,160
You... Do you really see it?

940
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,750
- What if I see it? 
 - Prove it.

941
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,480
You answer first. Out of one, two and three, what will you do?

942
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,260
You can't see it.

943
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:49,210
I can really see it though.  Really, I can.

944
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,530
This sword.

945
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:25,850
♬  I erased you because of the many painful memories   ♬

946
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:33,400
♬   Because your love pains me, I erased everything  ♬

947
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:41,200
♬  My love, don't throw me away, me. ♬

948
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:48,340
♬ My love, I am at your side. ♬

949
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:50,550
♬    Falling you  ♬

950
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:55,500
She sees the sword! She's my bride! That means I'm going to die!

951
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,370
Is she really my Uncle's bride? Why is she my Uncle's bride?

952
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:01,530
By God's joke.

953
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:07,420
It's a perfect house for raising kids. Let's have kids and live a good lovey dovey life.

954
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,290
Oh, is that why marriage is called the grave?

955
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:12,620
Ajusshi, is this possibly a honeymoon?

956
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:16,760
Hello, have you been well during this time?

957
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,320
I've made up my mind.

958
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:24,330
I have to disappear, before I end up wanting to live even more.

959
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:29,310
Before I get even happier. For you,

960
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:34,170
this is a choice I must make, to end this life.

961
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,980
♬ If it's a dream ♬

962
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,660
Because you are the Goblin's bride.

963
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,830
♬  I wish I could wake up ♬
