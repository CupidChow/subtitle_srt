17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,740
When a long cherished desire is buried in an object that's been touched by human hands or human blood,

18
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,200
it becomes a goblin. 

19
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,770
 Would there be so much blood from thousands of  battles buried in the sword

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,900
that it even includes the blood of it's owner?

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,880
 Only the goblin bride can remove the sword.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,080
"Once the sword is pulled out, the owner will return to nothingness and be at peace."

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,270
It was an awful oracle.

24
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,950
A goblin that re-awoke as such an immortal

25
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,440
is everywhere in this world and is nowhere...

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,850
Even now, he's still searching—

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,350
Why are you laughing, you rotten girl!

28
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,420
Even now, he's still searching somewhere for his bride,

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,680
"And that bride is me." Isn't this what you were going to say?

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,870
Even though I look like this now, I broke a few hearts in my day.

31
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,480
Don't come around next time for nothing and wonder where I've gone.

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,660
I'm so envious.

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,440
I must have lost my mind. This isn't something I should be boasting about in front of a single mom.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,800
You're mean.

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,900
I gave you a discount on spinach and cabbages. What do you mean I'm mean?

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,110
That jerk who ran off without you is the mean one.

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,960
That's true.

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,530
But that story is so sad.

39
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,240
You've got better things to be sad about.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,100
It's a terribly romantic curse.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,970
Having to find a bride in order to die.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,930
God is mean.

43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,650
God has always been mean. Selfish and jealous.

44
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,740
He only cares for himself.

45
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,590
Just like some jerk.

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,240
I'll get going. Sell a lot.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,360
Be sure to be here next time I come by.

48
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,020
When you face a moment at the brink of life or death...

49
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,010
be sure to pray earnestly.

50
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,300
 Perhaps... 

51
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,460
 a god with a tender heart may be listening to you. 
  [1968, Paris]

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,780
I wouldn't recommend that.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,240
If you leave home now, your life will get worse. You'll never see your mom again.

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,610
Who are you?

55
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,080
- Are you Korean? 
 - I'm more complex.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,460
It's your turn now. Speak clearly now.

57
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,530
Tell him he's your dad since he adopted you. So tell him to raise you well.

58
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,970
Tell your mom, too. Ask her to help you. Say you're hurting.

59
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,110
What are you talking about? Get away.

60
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,770
If you slash your wrist like that, you won't die. You just won't be able to use your hand. Keep that in mind.

61
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,380
- Who are you? 
 - Don't avoid eye contact. Speak clearly.

62
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,530
- Can you do it? 
 - And if I get beaten to death?

63
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,990
Will you take responsibility?

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,790
That's why I broke his ribs.

65
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,260
You little b*stard.

66
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,820
This is your lunch. Go to school after you talk.

67
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,390
The answer to your math problem #17 is 4, not 2. You just missed that one.

68
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,030
Who the heck are you?

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,660
 He is water, fire, and wind... 

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,710
light and darkness. 

71
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,620
 And at one point... 

72
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,500
He was human. 

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,800
 The people called him "god." 
 (Shin which means god in Korean)

74
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,470
 Covered in red blood, he'd slash his enemies...

75
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,120
 He was literally a god of war. 

76
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,770
 Hooray, General Kim Shin!  

77
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,620
 Hooray, General! 

78
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,780
 Hooray, General! 

79
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,780
Open the gate!

80
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,650
Here comes General Kim Shin, the champion of war!

81
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,640
Kim Shin, loosen your armor and receive the King's order.

82
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,380
You! Say that again.

83
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,530
A seventh-ranked auxiliary soldier dares to call out the name of the general?

84
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,030
Traitor Kim Shin.

85
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,610
- Loosen your armor and... 
 - Seriously...

86
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,270
I heard you. Wait.

87
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,200
Is that good?

88
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,680
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel,

89
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,620
- and hear the King's order. 
 - I'll pull your tongue out!

90
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,510
What? Traitor? Are you crazy?

91
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,410
Did you lose your mind?

92
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,380
General...

93
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,480
Traitor Kim Shin, put your sword down and kneel...

94
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,880
I'll see the King. Step aside.

95
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,410
- Criminal Kim Shin... 
 - If you stop me, you'll surely die.

96
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,290
Get out of my way.

97
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,000
You b*stards!

98
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,600
We fought three days and nights in the name of the King!

99
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,860
We are just coming back from that hell hole!

100
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,170
And you... how dare you!

101
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,280
 Open the gate! 

102
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,140
Stay with them.

103
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,480
I'll be right back.

104
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,510
King above the people. God above the King...

105
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,960
They say that "god" (shin in Korean) refers to Kim Shin.

106
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,650
 That man's constant winning is mesmerizing the people and... 

107
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,100
 his power continues to mock the royal court. 

108
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,570
Please punish him strictly according to the law of the land.

109
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,150
 He clearly saw the enemy's sword. 

110
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,350
 But he didn't see the young King's jealousy and fear directed toward him.

111
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,340
 That was... 

112
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,890
 the sharpest blade ever pointed at him.

113
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,640
 He did not know that. 

114
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,890
Must you go this far?

115
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,020
So, don't come closer. Stop right there.

116
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,050
Whatever that may be, stop it.

117
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,650
Stop right there and die a traitor. Then, everyone else will survive except you.

118
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,820
But if you move one step closer...

119
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,910
I'll kill everyone at every move you make and lay them in front of you.

120
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,260
Please go, General.

121
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,650
I...

122
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,630
am all right.

123
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,010
I...

124
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,300
- Your Highness... 
 - I know.

125
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,750
I truly know everything.

126
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,210
If this is our last moment, this is my fate.

127
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,100
So, please go. Don't stop and go to the King, General.

128
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,630
It's treason! Don't let anyone in that family draw another breath.

129
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,310
This is the King's order!

130
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,840
Halt!

131
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,090
What are you doing? Make the criminal kneel!

132
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,850
General!

133
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,250
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

134
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,900
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

135
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,800
When did the heavens take your side?

136
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,550
The criminal's glare is causing the king to be light-headed.

137
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,530
Be sure to kill him!

138
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,200
This is not yours to do.

139
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,390
General. General.

140
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,470
My ending ...

141
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,290
I'd like to ask you to do it.

142
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,120
I will obey the general's order.

143
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,890
Please forgive me.

144
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,950
I will soon follow suit.

145
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:57,120
No one is to tend to the traitor's corpse.

146
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,550
Throw it in the field as food for the birds and the beasts.

147
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,570
Pacifying the hunger of the birds and the beasts 

148
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,830
is the limit to that man's worth.

149
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,270
It's the royal command!

Save him.

158
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,600
Do not pray to anyone.

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,930
Since God is not listening.

On the brightest hour of the day at the fifth hour (between 11 am and 1 pm),

161
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,990
he died from the blade of the master whom he served and protected.

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,280
Are your eyes just accessories?

165
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,470
Do you want to die?

166
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,730
You jerk! What?

167
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,360
Wild boar.

168
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,640
What?

169
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,280
You hit a wild boar.

170
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,960
Are you alright? Should I call to report for you?

171
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,130
I hit a boar.

172
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,480
So a boar suddenly jumped out ...

173
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,800
A boar? In the middle of Gangnam?

174
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,030
That...that ...

175
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,960
Is this 911? This is the Yeoksam intersection.

176
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,350
There's a woman in the trunk who might be dead.

177
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm not sure. She's not moving now.

178
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
I don't really know. I don't know if it's because of a car accident or not.

179
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,450
I don't know what actually happened. Please come quickly.

180
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,080
- Why am I... 
 - Yes, here at the Yeoksam intersection traffic lights.

181
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,260
Why am I there?

182
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,910
Hwang Mi Young. Age: 25.

183
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,680
Born in 1973 on the 5th month 9th day (lunar calendar) at   Sin (Between 3 and 5 pm).

184
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,880
Dead  1998, 2nd month, 27th day  (Lunar calendar)

185
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,660
Time of death: 08:32.

186
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,960
Cause of death: Suffocation.

187
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,420
That's you, right?

188
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,140
Drink, it will erase your life's memory.

189
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,490
If I don't drink it, what will happen?

190
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,370
You will come to regret not drinking it.

191
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,300
May you only regret in this life.

192
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,480
- Goblin? 
 - Grim Reaper?

193
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,610
What a vulgar hat you wear.

194
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,950
My Lord.

195
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,800
It's been twenty years.

196
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,520
Have you been well all these years?

197
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,960
Have you been well, too?

198
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,930
I've aged a lot.

199
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,270
My Lord, you are just as dashing.

200
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,430
He doesn't look all that dashing.

201
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,720
You rascal!

202
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,550
It's my grandson that I mentioned in my letter.

203
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,780
Pay your respects.

204
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,010
Who is this mister?

205
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,800
So you are Deok Hwa.

206
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,610
I am your uncle, then I will be your brother.

207
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,870
Then I will be your son and your grandson.

208
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,310
Nice to meet you.

209
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,400
- What is that? It's getting more suspicious. 
 - You rascal!

210
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,150
Aigoo, I'm so sorry.

211
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,600
He's the only son in four generations, so very spoiled.

212
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,260
- But you are... 
 - Me? What?

213
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,100
Once there was a person born in Goryeo but died on foreign land.

214
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,580
Your distant ancestor.

215
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,420
- You look just like that child. 
 - Where?

216
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,920
Was that ancestor handsome?

217
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,340
Rascal. I don't know how this kid was born from us.

218
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,400
I'm ashamed, my Lord.

219
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,190
Don't worry about it.

220
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,210
- No one from your lineage ever disappointed. 
 - But, Uncle...

221
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,250
Why do you keep using informal speech to my grandpa?

222
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,930
- Do you want to die?  
 - You rascal!

223
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,750
My Lord.

224
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,120
I came too late.

225
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,250
I'm sorry your servant has

226
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,190
been sick...

227
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,680
It seems like...

228
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,270
my time is done.

229
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,100
From now on...

230
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,020
this child...

231
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,960
will serve you.

232
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,440
He's my grandson.

233
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,700
This knife is the Lord, Grandpa?

234
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,680
The desire of your people is saving you. 

235
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:55,060
However, the blood of thousands is on your sword. 

236
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:02,000
They were enemies to you but they were also God's creations.

237
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,450
Stay immortal alone and watch your loved ones die. 

238
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,210
You will never forget any deaths. 

239
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,180
This is my reward to you and the punishment you will receive. 

240
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,690
Only the bride of the Goblin can remove that sword. 

241
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:34,510
Once the sword is pulled out, you will return to nothingness and be at peace 

242
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,710
My Lord.

243
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,380
I have a place I need to go.

244
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,670
Sir.

245
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,540
How dare you! Who are you to belch such a blasphemous aura out?!

246
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Why this bastard...

247
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,840
You are...

248
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,230
I see that

249
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,120
I am late.

250
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,290
You are...

251
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,720
It seems you are the first punishment I receive.

252
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,760
Please accept my bow.

253
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:57,740
From this moment forward, I will serve you.

254
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,410
It was my grandpa's will.

255
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,060
I was blinded by revenge,

256
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,660
I never even greeted him and asked how he'd been.

257
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,040
Even so,

258
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,120
will you still do this?

259
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,540
It's nice to see such a scene at peace.

260
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,950
I'm happy that you get to see this scene at peace.

261
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,280
Here.

262
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,990
I am still full, so you eat it, my Lord.

263
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,290
You haven't eaten anything so how are you full?

264
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,180
I am small so even if I eat just a little, I get full.

265
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,180
You are big, my Lord, so you eat it, my Lord.

266
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,890
Then let's do this.

267
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,360
We are still far from the land.

268
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,760
If we share it, neither will get full.

269
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,430
So are you saying that you will starve?

270
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:08,990
If I get really hungry, I can work a little and get some food.

271
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,460
Did you think I brought you here so you can beg for food? Trust me.

272
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,990
I might be an even bigger person than you thought.

273
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,040
Hurry.

274
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,380
Wow.

275
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,240
My Lord! My L--

276
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,930
Can I take a look at your sack? We need to reduce the ship's weight.

277
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:08,040
My Lord! My Lord!

278
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,970
Put the child down at once and I will spare your life.

279
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,230
The waves are suspicious like a foul one is on board.

280
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:22,960
Must be you. We'll sell the guy as a slave so keep his limbs untouched and throw the kid overboard.

281
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,520
Do you know what happens when a human is worse than a beast?

282
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,270
You meet an angry god.

283
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,430
It's a g-g-goblin.

284
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,470
Save us.

285
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,380
It's too late.

286
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:45,220
At peace... it's nice to be back.

287
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,490
Please... save me.

288
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,710
If there's a god, please. 

289
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,040
Save me.

290
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:03,630
Save me, I'm begging you. Someone, please.

291
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,550
Who are you?

292
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,300
I am anyone.

293
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,630
Please. Please help me.

294
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,910
I'm not sure.

295
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,400
My principle is to not get involved in human life and death.

296
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,260
I can't die like this.

297
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:13,060
So you're not the one you're begging to save.

298
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,900
Just the baby...

299
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:53,750
You were lucky. You met a tender-hearted god. I don't want to see anyone die tonight.

300
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,220
Ji Yeon Hee, Age: 27

301
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,800
No name, Age: 0

302
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,190
Snow and blood

303
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,580
and flower.

304
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,480
It's the Goblin's bride.

305
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,060
The Goblin's bride was born.

306
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,780
8 years later

307
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,680
What kind of rice cake should I make for our Eun Tak's birthday?

308
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,040
Honey rice cake? Rainbow rice cake?

309
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,700
Mom, can I have a party instead of a feast now?

310
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,020
What's the difference?

311
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,830
Rice cake vs. regular cake. I want to blow candles and make a wish, too.

312
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,510
I don't think making a wish on a rice cake is working.

313
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,530
I didn't think about that. I made rice cake because you like rice cake.

314
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:54,040
Alright, starting from this year, we'll do parties with regular cake.

315
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,670
Wow, Mom is the best!

316
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,910
It's a puppy.

317
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,820
A puppy?

318
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:16,670
Look at this. Spring is here again. Isn't it amazing?

319
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:35,310
My, I'm so tired. Mom, I got 100% in English today.

320
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,260
I used my brain too much and I'm so tired.

321
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,740
Is that so?

322
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,650
- Wow, it's a cake! Mom, are we doing the party now? 
  - Yes.

323
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,460
Hurry and come sit. Light the candles.

324
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,300
I can light them?

325
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,770
Our Eun Tak is all grown up now so she can.

326
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,330
That's right. I'm 9 now.

327
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,510
I got 100% in English too so this is a piece of cake.

328
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,430
- Where did you learn that slang? 
- You don't need to know, Mom.

329
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:13,280
I learn easily from this and that person. I might be a genius.

330
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,840
What? You should make a wish.

331
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,010
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

332
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,170
You're not.

333
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:32,210
You're not real mom, but you're mom's soul.

334
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,470
You...

335
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,460
really can see it all.

336
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,570
I wished for you not to...

337
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,020
Mom, are you dead?

338
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,260
Really?

339
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:08,400
Where are you? Where are you now?

340
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,970
In the hospital near the crossroad.

341
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,390
There will be a call from the hospital soon, and your aunt will soon arrive when you get there.

342
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,650
It's cold at night, so make sure you wear your scarf.

343
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:35,720
And ask the supermarket grandma to go with you. You can find her, right?

344
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,970
Down the alley where the dry cleaner is and to the right.

345
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:44,070
How clever, my pumpkin.

346
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,570
In the future, don't ever make eye contact with the souls.  Okay?

347
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,730
I'm sorry, Mom, for seeing those kinds of things.

348
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,410
But, because I can see those things,

349
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,800
I can see you like this.

350
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,860
I'm really alright.

351
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,380
Okay.

352
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,690
Thank you

353
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,940
for seeing Mom like this.

354
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,350
Eun Tak...

355
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,740
I think I have to go now.

356
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,990
I love you, my pumpkin.

357
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,460
Me, too. I really love you, Mom.

358
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,420
Bye, Mom. Goodbye.

359
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,570
Mom, please go to heaven, okay?

360
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,860
Please. Please.

361
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,000
♫ And I could hold you for a while ♫

362
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,930
♫ to let you feel my pulse ♫

363
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,800
Mom! 
 ♫ Still here all alone ♫

364
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,280
Mom!
 ♫ My whole life ♫

365
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,200
♫ And all my heart ♫

366
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,590
♫ You're my whole life ♫

367
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,800
♫ And all my heart ♫

368
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,490
 Hello? Is this Ji Yeon Hee's home? This is Jaeil Hospital at the intersection. 

369
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,940
I know. I'm coming.

370
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,150
♬ And I am here   ♬

371
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,880
♬  Home, home...  ♬

372
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,110
A wish... I'm not going to make a wish.

373
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:13,140
I'm not going to wish for anything. No one's going to listen so who would I wish to.

374
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,350
♬  With me  ♬

375
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,120
Happy Birthday

376
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,690
How come, Grandma, you really don't age?

377
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,880
Is there more to age from here?

378
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,130
I guess that's kind of true.

379
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:54,460
Would it be okay if you look over Eun Tak here and there sometimes?

380
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,130
What the hell? Why would I look after your daughter?

381
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,740
Just here and there.

382
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,670
Give her some cabbage or spinach if there's any leftovers.

383
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,590
You should've died then, why did you live more?

384
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,630
You're mean.

385
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:18,920
You're the one who told me to pray earnestly.

386
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,530
There's a stupid girl who believes all that.

387
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:26,040
Thanks to believing that I lived on a bit more.

388
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,450
Thank you, Grandma.

389
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,320
I came to say goodbye.

390
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:43,640
I'm going.

391
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,360
Mister, who are you?

392
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,030
You... can you see me?

393
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:33,890
Oh, yeah, my scarf. I didn't wear my scarf. I'll get in trouble.

394
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,560
You did wear your scarf.

395
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,170
This is Ji Yeon Hee's home, right? She wasn't at the hospital.

396
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:47,330
But... how did a kid like you who was never supposed to be born..

397
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,640
[No name, Age: 0]

398
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,950
By chance, did you turn 9 this year?

399
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,490
I don't hear your voice at all, Mister.

400
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:07,230
What are you doing here?

401
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,290
Go.

402
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,030
- Leave that child alone. 
 - Grandma!

403
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,980
- You're interfering with my duty. 
 - Interfering with your duty, my butt.

404
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,760
Why are you doing what you should've done years ago?

405
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,530
I'm glad I get to do it even now. I'm running out of time.

406
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:31,190
That's your problem. Is this child's name in the book?

407
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,190
That child back then didn't have a name, but this child has a name.

408
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:40,180
If you have a record with this child's name in it, bring it to me. Then, I'll let you take her.

409
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,550
I need to document 9 years' worth of evidence to get cooperation from the Directory Department.

410
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,490
You know this...

411
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,130
I will see you again, kiddo.

412
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,730
Grandmother, Mother...

413
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,940
I know. That can't be helped. You need to live.

414
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:17,700
You have to move within three days, so that he can't find you.

415
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,800
Since you've made eye contact with the Grim Reaper, you shouldn't live here anymore.

416
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,460
If I move, he can't find me?

417
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,230
He can't. That's why the land you choose is important.

418
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:37,750
After midnight tonight, a man and two women will come looking for you.

419
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,160
Follow them.

420
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,940
You'll suffer a little bit, but you don't have any other choice.

421
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:54,130
Why are you telling me these things?

422
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,060
Because I like you.

423
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,750
When I gave you to her...

424
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,680
I was happy.

425
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,550
Here, your birthday gift.

426
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,440
[10 years later]

427
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,970
Excuse me.

428
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,560
Shall we grab a drink?

429
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,440
Sounds good.

430
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,770
 The card that was working fine up until yesterday won't work anymore all of a sudden. 

431
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:41,260
 So, Uncle... you know those unfriendly men in suits at the bar? 

432
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:47,190
 Right now, I'm with... I'm with those people. So, please answer the phone.

433
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:53,230
 They asked for your cell phone and I told them you don't have one and they were extremely unfriendly to me. 

434
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:56,390
Uncle, are you listening?

435
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:00,060
Uncle! Uncle!

436
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,600
Uncle!

437
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,250
Her senior year is almost over and she's still eating alone.

438
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,960
If you feel sorry for her, why don't you eat with her?

439
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,320
You crazy? Why should I? She sees ghosts.

440
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:20,010
I'm more scared of her than ghosts. Ghosts are invisible, at least.

441
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,540
Look at her. She can hear everything but pretends not to.

442
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,830
Hey.

443
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,300
Hey, I heard you're the Goblin's bride.

444
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,260
You can see me, right?

445
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,190
Come with me.

446
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,230
 I'm so lonely. 

447
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,120
Hey, why are you pretending to not see me?

448
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,700
You bitch!

449
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,830
Geez! Your looks!

450
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,640
Huh? So you can see me.

451
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:14,860
You... It's true then?  I... I'm... sorry.  Sorry!  Sorry!

452
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,240
What was that?

453
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,520
Why is she apologizing all of a sudden?

468
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:19,520
You didn't turn the light on.

469
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,770
I was in deep thought.

470
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,720
This is where you'll stay in your next life.

471
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,440
 Republic of Korea 

472
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:38,410
- Already? 
 - Yes, it's that time.

473
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,920
Deok Hwa is already 25 years old.

474
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,950
I told him to fix it up here and there, so leave around the end of the month.

475
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,400
If you want to leave now...

476
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:03,450
I probably won't get to see you again in my lifetime.

477
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:15,290
I thank you for every moment.

478
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,350
When you come back, Deok Hwa will be here.

479
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,790
Oh, boy... I keep forgetting the key.

480
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,380
I changed it to a keypad.

481
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,740
Grandfather! Uncle!

482
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:44,800
Uncle, you're here. I begged you so hard to come get me, yet you're still here.

483
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,700
Don' interrupt your elders' conversation!

484
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,050
Grandpa, did you cancel my card? You did, didn't you?

485
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,010
My secretary canceled it, punk.

486
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:57,550
Geez, I got so embarrassed! Do you know what it took me to entice her?

487
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,250
If you were going to do this, why did you make me into a rich family's third generation?

488
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,750
Uncle, are you going somewhere?

489
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,850
Where are you going?

490
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,580
Didn't I tell you to change the way you talk to him?

491
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,130
Grandpa, please be quiet.

492
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,190
Is that it? You looking for your bride?

493
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:20,470
Look, why can't you tell me you're leaving to get married, huh?

494
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,770
Why can't you tell me?

495
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,950
If I come back, this kid will be here, huh?

496
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:31,310
Uncle, exactly when, what date, time are you leaving?

497
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,100
Eat breakfast, one man, two women.

498
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:25,330
I said eat.

499
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,120
Hey, shut up, will you?!

500
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,580
Acting all-important for putting a meal together... Geesh...

501
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:34,780
What's with seaweed soup? Is today someone's birthday?

502
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,320
Daebak, did she just make seaweed soup because it's her birthday?

503
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,420
It is. Aigoo.

504
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,810
Why is she proud of coming into this world on the day her mom passed away?

505
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:47,020
Since she's didn't learn anything, she doesn't know shame.

506
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:50,550
She learned it from you. You raised her for 10 years.

507
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,340
Just eat up.

508
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,760
Thank you for celebrating my birthday, Aunt.

509
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:02,650
This is why they say not to raise an animal with black hair. I'm too nice.

510
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:06,580
Your mom's the poor one. She gave birth to you and raised you as a single mother.

511
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,340
That's a little too harsh.

512
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,990
What do you mean, harsh? She may have been your mom, but she's my older sister.

513
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,150
That's what I mean. By heart or bloodline, I'm closer to her.

514
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:18,020
Mom, do you even know what you're saying?

515
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,010
Just eat.

516
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,120
Where are you running off to?

517
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,230
I'm not running off. I'm going to school.

518
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,830
You're dead if you take the umbrella.

519
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:39,340
Bring your bank book to the bank after school. If you don't bring it again today, you know what's coming, right?

520
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,540
I said I don't have a bank book. How many times must I...

521
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:52,150
Then, where is that bank account? Where is your mom's insurance money?

522
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,330
How should I know that?

523
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:03,760
You took everything, Aunt. You even took the house deposit!

524
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,420
Geez, why does she talk so much from early in the morning... Gosh...

525
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,380
Shut up and bring it if you don't want to get beaten.

526
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,750
Every time I go to the bank, my bank book that was in the bag is gone. Who else could it be besides you?

527
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,580
I'm telling you, she's possessed.

528
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,780
That's right. There's a ghost on your back.

529
01:04:19,780 --> 01:04:22,460
What? You crazy... Hey!

530
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,650
♫ Through the endless daydream  ♫

531
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:39,480
♫ I saw you on the way back  ♫

532
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:46,430
♬  There I walked with you in my arms   ♬

533
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:50,200
♬  Through the blurry darkness,   ♬

534
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,120
♬  Who's veiling on the twilight   ♬

535
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:00,460
♬ We've been far away from my fears ♬

536
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:04,960
♬  Somewhere else I'll see you,   ♬

537
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,910
♬  Our days be like a blossom   ♬

538
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,750
♬  Blooming all around you  ♬

539
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:15,250
♬ so bright   ♬

540
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,880
♬ By and by  ♬

541
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,840
♬  I'll miss you,  ♬

542
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,560
♬ and your laugh like a sunshine  ♬

543
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:30,750
♬ Fading into shadow of tears ♬

544
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:38,400
But, my Lord, are you leaving alone this time as well?

545
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:42,230
That's what's happened.

546
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,830
None of the women I met could see the sword.

547
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:48,430
I think that's a relief.

548
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:55,500
When you're in pain because of the sword, I wish the bride would appear quickly.

549
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,300
But when I meet you like this, I wish no one knows about it.

550
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,160
Just human greed.

551
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:11,760
I feel relieved, too, that I still have you.

552
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,570
And the wine is plentiful.

553
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,170
Tonight, I'd like to live.

554
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,120
Should we toast?

555
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,650
When I was 9, I made up my mind to never do this.

556
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,090
But it's because I am very desperate, so I beg your understanding.

557
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,450
Please let me find a part-time job and do something about my aunt and the family.

558
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,950
Please let me have a boyfriend, too.

559
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,710
Please let me find a part-time job and do something about my aunt and the family.

560
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:21,290
Please help me get out of this measly circumstance 

561
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:24,210
somehow, please.

562
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,980
What the heck am I doing?

563
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,230
Who am I begging? There's no god.

564
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,050
It can't be raining, too, on top of all this.

565
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:55,220
Is this a small shower or a long rain?

566
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,310
Is the rain actually going to stop?

567
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:03,610
There are only two umbrellas but why does it keep raining?

568
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,670
Is it you?

569
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,650
You startled me.

570
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,410
Me?

571
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,410
Me?

572
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,850
Are you talking to me?

573
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:29,030
Yes, you. Is it you?

574
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:31,200
- What is? 
 - Are you the one who summoned me?

575
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,170
Me? I didn't.

576
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:36,480
You did. How in the world did you summon me?

577
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,650
How could I? I really didn't summon you.

578
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:43,300
You did. Definitely. Think about how you did it.

579
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,280
Earnestly?

580
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,120
I didn't summon you,

581
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,520
I just see you.

582
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,360
Like last time when our eyes accidentally met on the street.

583
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,750
You're that guy, right?

584
01:08:58,750 --> 01:08:59,840
What do you mean you see me?

585
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,420
You're a ghost. I see ghosts.

586
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,700
- I'm not a ghost. 
 - That's what they all say at first.

587
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,440
What are you?

588
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,950
What are you that I can't see what I normally see?

589
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,490
What should you be seeing?

590
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,880
Your 20s and 30s, your future.

591
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,000
I guess I don't have a future.

592
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:28,550
Were you a shaman before you died? Or a conman?

593
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:30,260
How you talk about the future.

594
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,150
What? What did you say?

595
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:36,860
Rest in peace. It's not good for you to roam around for long.

596
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,160
What's that flower?

597
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,590
You told me to leave. Why are you talking to me?

598
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:44,950
Fine. Go.

599
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,730
Buckwheat flowers.

600
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,190
That's not what I was asking.

601
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,160
I mean, why do you have them?

602
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,790
Let me see them. They don't suit you.

603
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:59,290
That was the first time I heard that. First time, for real.

604
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,170
You can give them to me. It's my birthday today.

605
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:09,230
A very glum birthday.

606
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:27,160
I seem to get plants on my birthdays. When I was 9, I got cabbage.

607
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,790
What does buckwheat flower mean in flower language?

608
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,090
Lover.

609
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:42,650
♬  This beautiful life. I'll stay by your side  ♬

610
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:52,030
♬   This beautiful life. I will stand behind you   ♬

611
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:01,970
Why were you crying?

612
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,230
The part-time job, the aunt's family, and the boyfriend.  Because of which one of these three?

613
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,600
How do you know that?

614
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,870
I heard you.

615
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:11,010
What do you mean you heard me?

616
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,330
I sometimes make someone's wish come true, too.

617
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:16,440
Someone's wish come true?

618
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:23,110
Like that genie? Like a guardian god?

619
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,860
Really? No wonder!

620
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:30,320
When I first saw you, I did sense you had a different vibe than other ghosts.

621
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,820
You're really my guardian god?

622
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,080
I never said I was your guardian god.

623
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,150
My mom said this.

624
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:38,330
Everyone is born with their own dictionary.

625
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:43,560
In my dictionary, no matter how you flip through it,

626
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,780
there's no sign of the words like 'happiness' or 'luck' at all.

627
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,870
- You know what I mean, right? 
 - I don't.

628
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:55,750
I mean if you could get me about $5000.

629
01:11:55,750 --> 01:12:00,620
If cash is difficult, you can let me know this week's lottery numbers.

630
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,200
Go say goodbye to your aunt's family. You won't see them for a while.

631
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,770
And work hard at your job at the chicken eatery. You'll get the job.

632
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:16,800
Hello? What about my boyfriend?

633
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,990
Hello? Look here!

634
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:23,640
How petty!

635
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,940
We've met before.

636
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:41,990
- Yes, we did. 
 - I am very familiar with your rumors.

637
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,950
There's a lot of bluff to my rumors.

638
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:47,300
What brings you to my house?

639
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,300
You live here?

640
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,710
All the furniture is included so if you just move yourself in...

641
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:56,150
Uncle, when did you get back?

642
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,180
- Explain. 
 - Uncle, it's just that this place would be vacant for 20 years anyway.

643
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:07,060
So for that 20 years, how much rent would we collect?  I started with that very innocent curiosity.

644
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,500
Do you know what that is to bring in? That thing—

645
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,660
How can you call the new renter "that thing?" He runs a tea shop.

646
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:18,240
Sorry, my uncle's not used to social exchanges.

647
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,430
- Please have some coffee. 
 - Thanks.

648
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,300
I haven't gotten the money yet.

649
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,530
There's a new car in the courtyard.

650
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,790
It's the new renter's car.

651
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:31,850
It's not my car. And the money...

652
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,890
I already gave him all.

653
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,530
Then I'll return the money to you, so you can leave now.

654
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,730
I get your situation, but

655
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:43,520
I've signed the contract already.

656
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,320
I hope that wasn't an important document.

657
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,350
That was a copy. The original copy is at the real estate office.

658
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,150
My stuff will come tomorrow. It's a lucky day.

659
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:58,860
If you're done drinking, go. Coffee is where my kindness stops.

660
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:00,270
Go  pack your stuff instead.

You're going to fight with a goblin?

663
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,350
I'm sure you're aware of what a contract with the Grim Reaper means.

664
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,860
In lieu of this house,  can I take that buddy right now?

665
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:18,350
I guess there's no other choice. We've got many extra rooms
 so you can stay here like it's your own.

666
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:21,340
- It is my house. 
 - It's my house.

Oops. My bad.

671
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,210
I meant to put it on my food.

672
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:10,200
Oops. My bad.

673
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,950
- I meant to sprinkle it on you.
 -  You?

674

Hey.

01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,630
- See? It's you. 
 - You scared me.

01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,650
Why do you keep following me?

695
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:41,570
I'm not following you. You summoned me again.

696
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:45,410
I didn't. If I had that talent, I wouldn't be in this hardship.

697
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,060
How would I? Did I shake some bells?

How can you ask me that?

A part-time job at a poultry farm?

- It's not. 
 - Then where?

706
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,640
You made me uselessly look forward to it like it was going to happen.

707

- You really don't know what you did to me? 
 - I didn't do it.

708
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:19,840
- I didn't summon you. 
 - It's you. It was you. I'm right.

This has never happened before.

Tell me everything you see about me.

- You are wearing a school uniform. 
 - And?

717
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,930
It's pretty.

718
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:51,840
The uniform is.

719
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,320
Is that all?

I found it out! I found out how I summon you.

729
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:05,580
But this isn't the best place to call me, right?

730
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,600
You're scared? I heard they are very good people.

731
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,370
Don't suck up to them. You said there's no god.

732
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,930
I just came to see where he might be.

733
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:22,940
How come you don't go in a flame and walk instead?

734
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:26,630
You can't do that here. It's like a type of demilitarized zone.

735
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,260
Don't follow me.

Not that. My boyfriend.

739
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,170
You need to work hard on that, too.

740
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,930
I don't think you should treat me like this.

741
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,530
I know the method now. It's like I got his number.

742
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:02,290
I didn't think this would work.

743
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,350
Why did you do it if you thought it wasn't going to work?

744
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,400
Oh, wait a minute.

745
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:18,940
Did you just grab me?

746
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,990
I can't do it anymore. So hot!

747
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,690
It was blue flame so I thought it was going to be cold.

748
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,440
Blue flame is the hottest. You need to study harder.

749
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,220
Right.

750
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,280
I never lost being first place in my class
 even after losing my parents at a young age and living with...

751
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,670
Never mind.

752
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:43,560
Instead of being my guardian god or something, 
can you just end this by giving me five thousand bucks?

753
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,450
I've got work  to do so I need to go, okay?

754
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,430
What work?

755
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,410
Your attire is pretty reverent.

756
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,420
Tomorrow's the memorial date of someone I know.

757
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,570
But why are you going today? Is it in the countryside?

758
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:56,010
Over there, today is tomorrow.

759
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,600
When are you coming back? Tomorrow? The day after?

760
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,730
- I have something I really want to ask you. 
 - Do it quickly.

761
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:09,810
I know this question will sound weird
 but please listen to it without any misunderstanding.

762
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:11,140
I understand, so what is it?

763
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,040
I thought you might be the grim reaper at first.

764
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,150
But if you were the grim reaper, you would've taken me away as soon as you saw me.

765
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,810
Then the next time, I thought you were  a ghost.

766
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:25,720
But you have a shadow.

767
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:31,590
So I thought about it. What in the world is that mister?

768
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:34,470
- So what am I? 
 - Goblin.

769
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,960
Aren't you  a goblin?

770
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,670
What are you?

771
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:47,920
- What the heck are you?
 - This is kind of weird to say myself,

772
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,870
but I'm the Goblin bride.

773
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,040
You know I can see ghosts, right? When I was born,

774
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,770
I was born with something like this.

775
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,500
I think it's because of this that the ghosts call me the Goblin's bride.

776
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,390
You see it? This.

777
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:22,920
See it?

778
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,620
Prove it.

779
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,790
- You want me to prove that I'm the Goblin's bride? 
 - Yes.

780
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,650
How?

781
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,400
Should I fly?

782
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,560
Or change to a broom?

783
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,320
- Try it. 
 - I'm very serious right now.

784
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,880
Me, too.

785
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,580
Tell me what you see.

786
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:51,120
- Is this your revenge? 
 - Tell me everything you see.

787
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:58,380
- You're tall. 
 - And?

788
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,430
- Your clothes look expensive. 
 - And?

789
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,410
- Maybe mid-30's? 
 - And?

790
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:12,730
You don't actually hope to hear me say you're handsome, right?

791
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:16,970
You should've had the answer I wanted.

792
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:21,790
If that's all you see from me, then you're not a Goblin's bride.

793
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:24,750
You have no effective value to a goblin.

794
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:29,740
I'm sorry you see ghosts, but just be grateful you're alive.

795
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:34,890
You're just a side effect from a violation of the principle 
against messing with human life and death.

796
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,940
If I don't want to put up with it?

797
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:43,890
There's a way to die too like you were supposed to originally.

798
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:45,920
The way you talk.

799
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,590
I got that and I'll repeat  my question earlier.

800
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,220
Are you by chance

801
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,910
- a goblin? 
 - I'm not.

802
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:59,810
- You're not? 
 - No. 
 - Then what are you?

803
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:04,070
What are you that you decide whether I have value or not?

804
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:06,820
You said you want to be in a little better situation.

805
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:12,640
Someone who is a little concerned about your sucky situation.

806
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,670
Live in the reality. Not in rumor.

807
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,050
You're not a goblin's bride.

808
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,720
Wait a moment.

809
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,910
I'm not done talking.

810
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:49,280
Did you just come through that door following me?

811
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,550
You! How did you get here?

812
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:56,980
Grab the handle and push.

813
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,270
Follow you.

814
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,520
But what's with this place?

815
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,440
So I'm asking you how in the world you passed through that door.

816
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:08,840
Maybe this is Paju? The English village?

817
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,740
But this is still strange. What is this? Where is this?

818
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:16,600
- Canada. 
 - Canada?

819
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,780
Canada...

820
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,310
That... the maple country?

821
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:26,890
The aurora place?  Is this really abroad?

822
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,350
Amazing! You had this kind of power?

823
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:41,640
You do, too. What are you really?

824
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:47,540
If this is really Canada and if you can do this with your power, then I've decided.

825
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,810
- On what? 
 - I've made up my mind.

826
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:53,410
- About what? 
 - I'll marry you, Mister.

827
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:57,860
No matter how I think about this, I really think you are a goblin.

828
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:00,320
I love you.

829
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:12,680

835
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,520
Is this the place? Red carpet for me? 

836
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,190
You feel honored to be walking with me, right? 

837
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,190
What the heck are you? 

838
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:00,290
I'm someone who will be your bride after 200 years. 

839
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,710
I think she'll keep summoning me. When or wherever, I want to look intellectual and perfect.

840
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:08,340
- Was it manly? 
 - Deok Hwa.

841
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,240
- Did something bad happen? 
 - Do you think I want to be your bride? 

842
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,840
Watch out for the man who wears a hat. A very black hat. 

843
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,450
Am I dying? I'm just barely 19. 

844
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:21,270
Some die at 9, and some die at 10. 

845
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,020
That's death.
