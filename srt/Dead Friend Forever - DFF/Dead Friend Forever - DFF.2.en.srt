00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,680
Hey, I don't think that's the one.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,520
What? What? A Porn? Phee, put that on!

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,680
Who wore the mask?

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,080
Why haven't you ever brought him to us?

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
Shit!

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,840
Ahhhhh!

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Because we continued filming the story that he wrote, it's cursed.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
And he's now killing each one of us.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,440
I don't know what the hell you guys went through.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,080
But if we want to know more about the 9th person...
if he's a murderer, a thief or a ghost,...

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,560
then we gotta to prove it.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,040
There! There really is a ghost.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
Hey, maybe he's not a ghost.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,520
Hey, Phee, what are you doing?

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,519
Well, you saw there's a ghost in the video.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Take a look first.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,360
Damn you, Tan.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,400
What were you doing there?

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,520
Man, Tan, you shithead.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
What were you doing there?

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,800
I was just organizing the setting behind the camera.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I tried to not be in the way, but you guys got me anyway.

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,360
The face...

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
Por, what's wrong? Does your face hurt?

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
The mask.

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,720
What mask, Por?

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Shit, Por, get up and answer!

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Hey, what the fuck are you doing? He could die.

30
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,480
Well, I told you it's cursed.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,560
Shit, we shouldn't have continued to shoot that movie.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,880
Why would you wake him up?

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Top, man, stop it! What curse? That's absurd.

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
Didn't you hear what he just said? A mask.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,400
Do you remember the movie Non wrote?

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,400
A masked murderer. Right now, he's after all of us.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,760
And Por is his first corpse.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,760
What corpse? Por is not dead yet.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
Well, not for long.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
If Por doesn't get medical treatment soon,

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,079
I give it two days, max.

42
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,760
I don't know if he's gonna make it through tonight.

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,560
What are you talking about? Are you gonna let our friend die?

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
Find a way to help him!

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
That's so fucking easy to say.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
So, how are you gonna help him? Tell us.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,960
Okay, we just need to get out of here ASAP.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,920
If we get out now, not only Por will die...

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Yeah, I think Non Ghost might break our necks.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,920
Tee, do you also think that Non Ghost was the one who did this?

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
How about these wounds? What do you think?

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
I think it's a theif's doing.

53
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,160
A theif who wanted to rob from Por's Dad's place.

54
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,240
Bullshit. A thief who wouldn't break in but would lurk outside to attack us?

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Take a look, did Por lose anything?

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,720
If you don't think it's a curse, then it's up to you.

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,720
If something happens again, don't say I didn't warn you.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait, are you gonna let our friend die like this?

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Tomorrow, Uncle Dang will be here. We'll take him to the doctor then.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,480
For now, whoever wants to die, be my guest.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
What if he doesn't make it til tomorrow?

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't know.

63
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,120
If you wanna stay, stay. I'm outta here.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey, Tee!

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
What should we do? Tee has gone nuts.

66
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Are we gonna let more people die?

67
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Don't.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Please don't.

69
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
That was my fault.

70
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Hey, who's there? It's not funny.

71
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,520
Hey, I've told you it's not funny.

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Hey!

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What the hell?

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Hey!

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Hey, who's out there?

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
It's not fun.

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Open the door for me. Open it!

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
It's not fun.

79
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Help me! Help me!

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Please don't hurt me.

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't.

82
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Don't.

83
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Don't.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Ahhhhh!

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Oh, did I wake you up?

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,600
How long was I asleep?

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
What happened?

88
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,920
Not long. There's nothing.

89
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Go ahead and take a good rest. I'll look after Por.

90
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
No, you take a rest. You've been up all night, haven't you?

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,159
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

92
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:40,680
At least, go take a shower so you'll freshen up.

93
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
We'll take turns to rest.

94
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Is it a new day now?

95
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Where is Tan?

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He went to sleep upstairs a while ago.

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,040
So, Uncle Dang will come at noon, right?

98
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Yes, at noon.

99
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
So the guy upstairs won't be coming down for real?

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,400
I never thought Tee would be like this.

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
He's so superstitious that I never thought he would.

102
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,480
I think he's been stressed lately.

103
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,480
The reason we all went nuts is because of the movie Non wrote, right?

104
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,320
So, is there anything else that I don't know?

105
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Open the door! Or I'll break in!

106
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,240
Top, open the door!

107
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Top, what's wrong? Top!

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Top! Open the door now!

109
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,040
Top! Open it now!

110
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,240
Open it! Open it! Open it!

111
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Top, If you don't open it, I'll really break in.

112
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Top, calm down now.

113
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,720
Easy.

114
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,400
Easy there, Top.

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,080
Let's take him outside.

116
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Calm down, shit.

117
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,160
Sit down.

118
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Top, sit down first.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Top, calm down.

120
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
What happened?

121
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,760
I...I know...

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
What do you know? Look at me and talk.

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Guys, believe me, the ninth person in this house is really Non.

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
How's that possible?

125
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Non just disappeared. He wouldn't come back to this house.

126
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,400
You remember the scene where we shot in the restroom in that short movie?

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Tee, Non insisted how he would shoot that murder scene. You remember?

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,840
He wanted the murderer to slash the restroom door with an axe and hunt.

129
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
So, that was exactly what happened earlier.

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I was washing my face. The light was flickering.

131
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,080
And I couldn't open the door.

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,400
And then, I heard someone dragging an axe along the way.

133
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
He put the axe right into my face, well, almost into my face.

134
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,680
It must be Non Ghost for sure.

135
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,680
He's very protective of his short movie. So he's seeking his revenge.

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Top, maybe you just couldn't open the door.

137
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,080
I think you're scared of Non Ghost that you're being nonsense.

138
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,080
That's why I told you it's Non Ghost. Thai ghosts can do anything.

139
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Tee, don't tell me that you believe that too.

140
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,960
Don't you have any discernment?

141
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,120
I don't want to believe that it's something mysterious.

142
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
But earlier, no one pranked Top.

143
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,480
Or was it you, Jin?

144
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,680
And why the hell would I do that?

145
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
Last night, I was with Por, White and Phee all night.

146
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,960
See? I told you it's definitely Non Ghost.

147
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,160
He's after us for revenge.

148
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,760
We must get out of here fast, believe me.

149
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Oh! And now you're not scared of getting out of this house anymore?

150
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,040
If we stay, we die. If we get out, we die. It's the same, isn't it?

151
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,680
At least, I'm willng to take my chance. I don't wanna die here.

152
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Calm down, Uncle Dang will be here soon.

153
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,040
If Non Ghost really existed, he wouldn't come haunt us in the middle of the day.

154
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I think right now, we must find the answer....

155
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Who or what that hurt Por.

156
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
We are innocent. I won't go to jail.

157
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm not guilty. I didn't do anything.

158
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I will become a doctor, no matter what.

159
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,080
My life can't end like this.

160
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,840
I think what we should do is wait for Uncle Dang quietly.

161
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,840
What's the point of figuring out what happened to Por?

162
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,080
If we found out more, and it got worse,...we might have to die?

163
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,080
So is there no other conclusions aside from it's Non Ghost's curse?

164
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Did we really wake him up by continue shooting his movie?

165
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Well, there was nothing before that.

166
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,320
Everything happened after we shot the movie.

167
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,720
You guys are out of your mind.

168
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,960
Let me tell you again.

169
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Non is not dead yet. He just disappeared.

170
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,280
And the reason you're this scared...

171
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
is because we remembered, right? What we did to Non...

172
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,480
But I believe that he's already dead.

173
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,880
If he isn't dead, he must come see us already.

174
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,760
At least, he would come see you, Jin.

175
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I don't know, he never came to me once.

176
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,440
If this is really Non's doing,...

177
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,840
how would humans fight a ghost?

178
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,680
We must break the curse before there's another victim.

179
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,680
That's really easy to say. Is anyone here an exorcist? Let me ask you this.

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Ghosts, they all have attachment on something.

181
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,480
We must destroy everything that belongs to Non.

182
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,840
Like, the hard disk.

183
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Por must have kept the footages we took. We must find them.

184
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Starting from Por's room.

185
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
I don't think...it's a ghost's doing.

186
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I think it's a man's doing.

187
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Hmm. Top is fearful. He must have been delusional.

188
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,200
And one more thing, why would they have to be so scared
of their friend, Non, that much?

189
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,840
That's true.

190
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Isn't Non their friend?

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,560
Or do they have a secret that we don't know?

192
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,560
I think in the past, they must have done something to Non.

193
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Er...Last night, when I was looking after Por,...

194
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I heard Por murmur...

195
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Please forgive me.

197
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,840
And he didn't think of telling us?

198
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,600
I mean, what they went through in the past...

199
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,680
And now they're being superstitious.

200
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,680
What if it's the ninth person who's gonna hurt us,
then how are we gonna deal with that?

201
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:15,400
How about this? I'll act like I believe in all this
and spy on them to see what they're hiding.

202
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Okay.

203
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,120
Fluke, what did you guys talk about? So what now?

204
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I don't know. We don't know what to do yet.
I guess we'll have to wait for Uncle Dang.

205
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
It's like we find ourselves trouble.

206
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,000
Your ghost friend is really wicked.
Don't know if he's gonna hurt anyone else like he did to Por.

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,120
I think this time it may be fatal.

208
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Top was attacked too. Luckily, he's still okay.

209
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I don't know who's gonna be next.

210
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,960
Tee, you or Jin...

211
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,680
You thought so, right? That you're gonna be next.

212
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,560
If you wanna do something, hurry and do it.
I'm worried for you.

213
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,920
We…intend to remove the curse

214
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,920
by destroying all the footages Non took.

215
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,600
So he would go the next life.

216
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
You think doing that would work?

217
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,920
We don't.

218
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,920
But we must try.

219
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
And where are those footages?

220
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,800
Por might put them in the hard disk and stash it somewhere in this house.

221
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Tee and Top are looking for it right now.

222
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,640
But I think I'm gonna check on Por first.

223
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
So he will stay alive when Uncle Dang arrives.

224
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Okay.

225
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
And Jin won't scold me.

226
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,280
He keeps being sarcastic.

227
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
What are you gossiping about?

228
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Speaking of the devil.

229
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,080
You should go see Por's wound.

230
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Act like a to-be doctor.

231
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Alright, I'm doing that right now.

232
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,440
A good-mouthed and good-hearted man like you...
doesn't need to remind me.

233
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,120
Take a look there. I'll look here.

234
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Okay.

235
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I talked to Fluke earlier. I'll help you find it.

236
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,160
Once we find the hard disk...

237
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,160
and destroy it, then problem's solved. We're going home.

238
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Right.

239
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,520
But where should I start?

240
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Well, look through everything. Let's help each other.

241
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
Hey.

242
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,440
What?

243
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I think I've found it.

244
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Shit. A game console.

245
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Tee.

246
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Did he mean for me to find it on purpose?

247
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm the next one? I don't want that.

248
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Keep it down, shit. Do you want them to know?

249
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
Calm. Didn't we agree that we wouldn't
talk about what happened three years ago?

250
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,800
Can we not do that now?

251
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Lower.

252
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,440
You see, the vendetta he has against us.

253
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,240
Because we did that to him, and now he's disappeared.

254
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,200
Top! I told you to never bring that up again.

255
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
When he was alive, we could beat him.

256
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,840
When he's a ghost, why couldn't we beat him?

257
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Listen, we can't let other people know about this.

258
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,680
No matter what, we gotta find that hard disk before others do.
Just do it, man.

259
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,360
And we're going to leave this place safe and sound.

260
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,880
Yesterday, when we filmed the movie, I put it in this hard disk.

261
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,400
I just wanna check if there's something wrong.

262
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Okay. Let me have it.

263
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Play.

264
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,000
Hey, did you see that?

265
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,880
What?

266
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
One sec.

267
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Hey, did you hear something?

268
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
One sec.

269
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Okay, I'll turn the volume up.

270
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Ouch!

271
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Hey.

272
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Hey, could the computer shut itself suddenly?

273
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Can I try?

274
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
The battery is dead.

275
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,760
So what do we get from watching the footages?
To see someone's shadow?

276
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,760
How about the walkie-talkies you found,
can they not communicate with the outside world?

277
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,600
The faster we can reach other people,
the faster we can get help for Por.

278
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,440
I'll try to boost the signal.

279
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,640
In case we can talk to the outsiders.

280
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Okay.

281
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Just hurry up and do what you gotta do.

282
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I don't think we have much time left.

283
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Shit.

284
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Help me look.

285
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Shit.

286
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Hope this works.

287
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
1 to 2.

288
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Over.

289
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Shit.

290
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Shit, that worked.

291
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
1 to 2, do you copy? Over.

292
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is the valley mansion.
We need help immediately. Over.

293
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
I'm not even a doctor yet.

294
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
And now I'm letting people die.

295
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Shit!

296
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Hey!

297
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,200
Por, what the hell is wrong with you?

298
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,000
Por, Por!

299
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Ahhhh!

300
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,560
This must be the knife of the ninth person for sure.

301
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,240
He must be a murderer, not a ghost.

302
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,240
He left an evidence like this.
He is definitely challenging us.

303
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,720
And this guy, would he leave an evidence like this?

304
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,520
Seriously, I think it's hard to tell.

305
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,840
I've been studying medicine for two years.

306
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,840
These are definitely knife's marks.

307
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
We must keep this as an evidence for the police.

308
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,080
Who's the bad guy here?
And what the fuck does he want?

309
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,040
He left an evidence right in front of our faces.

310
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,200
Maybe he's a psycho killer.

311
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,200
The Janta disciple who sacrifices lives like the legend says.

312
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Guys.

313
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,080
Anyone heard something?

314
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,520
It was really spooky. Didn't you guys hear it?

315
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,240
Nah.

316
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,680
Tan, you're too stressed. Have some water.

317
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,480
I'm for real, man.

318
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,400
Did he wear a mask?

319
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,280
I don't know. I didn't see him clearly.

320
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,400
But we all have seen the masked murderer...

321
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,400
just like the short movie Non shot.

322
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm serious, guys.

323
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,600
The short movie we shot three years ago...

324
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
What's the synopsis? Do tell.

325
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Well, it's about a masked murderer hunting people in the house.

326
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,520
But no one would ever know who's behind the mask. That's all.

327
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,600
So, the guy who did this...

328
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,600
must know about the incident from three years ago
because it happened exactly like the script.

329
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Where are Tee and Top?

330
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,680
They are looking for the hard disk.

331
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,120
They believe in Non's curse.

332
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,120
So, what really happened to the guy named Non?

333
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,800
What did you three do to him?

334
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I don't know. Ask someone else because I never messed with anyone.

335
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,760
If you ask them, you won't get the answer.

336
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,760
What we can do now is finding the hard disk before they do.

337
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,160
So we'll know what happened three years ago.

338
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,480
So, what are we waiting for?

339
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
RIght.

340
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
Jin, have a look here.

341
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,360
Yeah.

342
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,200
White, search the bags.

343
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Tan, you look around here. I'll look here.

344
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,560
White, I think we should go find it somewhere else.
I saw that there's a room under the stairs.

345
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,320
Alright.

346
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
C'mon.

347
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
found it!

348
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,120
It's empty?

349
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes.

350
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Then who took it?

351
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Damn it.

352
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
C'mon.

353
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
If we destroyed it, we wouldn't be able to get it back.

354
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,680
That's good. Why would you want it?

355
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,200
Destroy it and then we'll pray for Non.

356
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Hey!

357
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,720
What the hell?

358
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,120
Why are you destroying the hard disk?

359
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,200
Give it back. I'll destroy it. Let go!

360
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,320
Jin, let go! Let go now!

361
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,280
Top, damn you!

362
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,920
Ah.

363
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,760
Phee, you shithead.

364
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,520
Fuck you, Tee.

365
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Phee, what's wrong with you!

366
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,400
Stop!

367
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,080
Can you stop fighting?

368
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,480
Cut it off.

369
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,520
Why would you fight each other? What good does it do?

370
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,520
Aren't we supposed to find the ninth person who's hiding in this house ?

371
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,360
Tan and I really found that there's a person who's really hiding here.

372
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,760
And we found the knife that was used to hurt Por.

373
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,400
It's not curse or anything.

374
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,560
White, did you really find the knife?
So it really is a man's doing, right?

375
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,400
I don't care about what you found.

376
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,400
No, you can't look at that hard disk!

377
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,640
Why can't we?

378
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,920
I told you no. No means no.

379
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,600
Hey!

380
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Are you guys that scared that it turned you nuts?

381
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
I'll look at it, no matter what.

382
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Hey, what if something happens after we take a look at it?
Who will be responsible?

383
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,680
What would happen? Are you out of your mind?

384
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm not saying I don't believe in what White and Tan said.

385
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,600
But I'm asking what if it's cursed,
will you be able to be resposible for it, Phee?

386
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,719
Then, we won't look at it. We'll wait for Uncle Dang to arrive,
get us out and then we'll have a look.

387
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,360
So we all will survive. No one will have to risk anything, okay?

388
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,400
I'm okay with not taking a look at it.

389
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
How about you?

390
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,480
I'm okay with it.

391
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Tee, you keep your word. Don't destroy the hard disk.

392
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,639
Alright.

393
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I think there must be a video of pranks for sure.

394
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,000
Or it could be they all prank Non or something.

395
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,320
Destroy it? I think there's something fishy about it.

396
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
No, I don't think Tee is that kind of guy.

397
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Just think about it, why would they prank one person for?

398
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
I don't think Tee was involved.

399
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Jin, you were there. What really happened?

400
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Well...

401
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,440
It's nothing.

402
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,440
We just filmed a short movie.

403
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Shit, Por!

404
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Look.

405
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
Look at him.

406
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
How is Por holding up?

407
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,480
Guys, Uncle Dang is here.

408
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:29,600
Let's go.

409
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
C'mon.

410
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,040
Tee, we made it!

411
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,240
Uncle Dang, this way! Uncle Dang!

412
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,240
We're in a big trouble, Uncle.
You must get us out of here ASAP.

413
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
Shit, Uncle Dang!

414
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
What the fuck happened?

415
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Shit, Tee, I don't want to be the next one.

416
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,840
Shit, he actually killed.

417
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm not staying here any more.

418
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
Hey, wait, where are you going?

419
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,880
You don't want to die here, do you?
Then, what are you waiting for? Let's go.

420
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
What are you waiting for? C'mon!

421
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Hurry!

422
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
What the fuck!

423
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

424
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Who's that?

425
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,360
Uncle Dang.

426
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,040
Definitely not a ghost's doing.
This is not a ghost's doing.

427
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,840
Definitely not.

428
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
This is the ninth person's doing.

429
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Where is Tee?

430
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Where is Tee?

431
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Where are Tee and Top?

432
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Where is Tee? Where?

433
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
The way is so crooked.

434
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:45,960
Ah.

435
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
C'mon.

436
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,120
Hey, Top, watch out!

437
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Oh, shit, shit.

438
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Tee!

439
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Didn't you see that?

440
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,280
What? What was there to see?

441
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Did you hear that? Someone's moving.

442
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Who's moving? I'm standing still here, doing nothing.

443
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
Shit.

444
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,160
Let's go back to the house.

445
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Huh?

446
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Why would we go back? We've come this far.

447
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
What I saw earlier,...it could be the bad guy.

448
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I couldn't leave White. I'm going back for him.

449
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Let's go.

450
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
C'mon.

451
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Alright, alright, your call, man.

452
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Tee.

453
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
What's the matter, Tee?

454
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Hurry!

455
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,440
White!

456
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,800
Tee!

457
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,240
How are you holding up?

458
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Nothing happened, right?

459
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
No.

460
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,040
But I saw Uncle Dang, he's...dead.

461
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
And then I became worried about you and Top.

462
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Where have you been?

463
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
You went out to get help for us, right?

464
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
Right? You didn't think about running away, did you?

465
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Tell him!

466
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Where have you been?

467
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,560
We went out to get help. I couldn't leave Por like this.

468
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Really?

469
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,440
You didn't think about leaving us here, did you?

470
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,200
Damn you, Phee. Are you doing this on purpose?

471
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Stop it, guys. Stop fighting.

472
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Fuck you.

473
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,560
You guys took Uncle Dang's vehicle.

474
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,040
That means when you saw him,

475
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
he was still alive, right?

476
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,720
Right.

477
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,080
When I saw him, he was driving in.

478
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,080
When he was getting closer,...

479
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
it's just like what you saw.

480
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
What if this continues,

481
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,960
the next one is going to be one of us.

482
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,160
Does a fucking ghost use the wire?

483
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Uncle Dang is lying dead in front of the house. You can see that.

484
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,480
So what should we do with his body?
We can't leave him like that.

485
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,240
What if our fingerprints got on his body...or even DNA?

486
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,240
And there's an autopsy, we all will be doomed.

487
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,880
Three years ago, you all came here
to just shoot a short film? So determined.

488
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
No.

489
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,600
Por, what did you say?

490
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
Can you hear me?

491
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
One, two, three.

492
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,560
Cut!

493
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,000
Cut!

494
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Monitor...

495
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,880
Slate. Cut one. Take six. AB. End slate.

496
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,320
Tee, Non insisted how he would shoot that murder scene. You remember?

497
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,120
Cut.

498
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,960
Cut!

499
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,760
Slate.

500
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
Cut!

501
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
End slate. Camera.

502
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Cut. Cut! Take a look.

503
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,320
What the hell happened?

504
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,720
Cut.

505
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,560
Cut.

506
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Slate.

507
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,520
Cut six. Take four. End slate.

508
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,160
Oh, shit.

509
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,080
Shit!

510
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
Cut!

511
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,680
Shit, we hit in the head.

512
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,760
It's alright.

513
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
That hit you once.

514
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,400
What if this continues,

515
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,760
the next one is going to be one of us.

516
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,080
Cut.

517
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Cut!

518
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,120
Wow, a mosquito is biting me right now.

519
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
I can feel it.
