2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,160
In the story, everyone will meet a murderer who wears a mask.

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,440
People come to sacrifice their lives here.

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,960
And the team that is chosen to get the budget
to make a short film is...The Hidden Character.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,160
Fuck!

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't tell anyone about this.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Grab the camera. I'll teach you.

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,480
You, fucking Greasy!

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,560
You go ahead and tell your parents to pay me back now!

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
I have a way for you to easily earn big money.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
So what do I have to do?

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
Get off.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Follow me.

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
You just sit and wait here.

15
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
This is yours, Greasy.

16
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,200
So where is it?
The bank account book I told you to open.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Oh.

18
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I downloaded the application already.
You can register it on your phone.

19
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Done.

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
That's it?

21
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Hey! Why did you transfer so much money to me?

22
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,880
Hold it right there!

23
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,760
That doesn't belong to you.
That's the customer's money.

24
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,960
Your job is to transfer money to the accounts
that I send you every day.

25
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,920
Once the money reaches the clients' accounts, your job's done.

26
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,240
But don't do anything outside the plan.

27
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,920
If caught, we all will be fucked.

28
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,760
So this is all I gotta do?

29
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,760
That's just a part of it.
You gotta find more people to open the bank accounts.

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,040
Because there are more customers here each day.

31
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
Where do I find those people?

32
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Well, that's your business. You must find some.

33
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
If you get less customers, you'll get less commission too.
Understood?

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,880
But will I find the money to fix the camera in time?

35
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,680
Stop it right there.

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,240
Don't you dare think about stealing the customers' money
or close the accounts and run away.

37
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,240
If the boss catches you, you'll be dead.

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Dead?

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,440
Er...Hello to all of you, 1,000 people who are watching...

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,320
Hello. / Hello.

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Today, we're on a live because we have an exciting news to announce.

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
We will have our own short film! Yeah!

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,680
And the story is about...

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,560
Por, you go ahead.

45
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,440
It's a found footage film, kinda like a Vlogging.

46
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,520
Well, we, a group of friends will go on a trip to a vacation home.

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,560
But we will meet with a 6th mysterious person.

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,560
And this particular 6th person...
well, we will see him in different ways.

49
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,160
Er...lots of you are asking where our short film will be shown...

50
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,560
Actually, our short film we're about to make is for a contest.

51
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,880
Yes, and we got 100% budget to make it happen.

52
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
We will show the movie in the cinema too.

53
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Therefore, don't forget to support Thai movies.

54
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
What? Is that all?

55
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Man, Por, you did all the talking.
I didn't get to say anything.

56
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
You talked a lot already, Top.

57
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,080
Man, ten thousands of likes, really?

58
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,880
We're going to be superstars!

59
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Hey, but there are also thousands of bad comments.

60
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
Bad comments make us more famous.

61
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
We're the talk of the town, you know.

62
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Shit, one website put our news on their page.

63
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Damn!

64
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,880
From now on, you can call me Mr. Director Por.

65
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,880
They don't even put our pics on the news.

66
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,280
Right, they only did the news on you.

67
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,280
I think your Mom bribed them.

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
No, our film is interesting.
It got nothing to do with my parents.

69
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,240
It's gonna slay, let me tell ya.

70
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,000
This is exciting.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,480
Yeah.

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,520
Oh, you're about to leave?

73
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,800
So, have you seen the news about your short film yet?

74
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes, it's such a big news.

75
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
Were you the one who made this happen?

76
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,200
Not really, it's just that the other day,
I ran into Tom, the news editor.

77
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
So I told him about your short film
but I didn't think he's gonna publish it.

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,480
Er, Dad...Mom...

79
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Well, we'd better go now, please excuse us.

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Goodbye, goodbye.

81
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,440
Wait.

82
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
How's your short film going?

83
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Is it done yet?

84
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,360
We're working on it.

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
Is it in process?

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,720
You've started shooting already, right?
Let me see the progress.

87
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,720
Actually, we had a little bit of a problem at the set, so...

88
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,520
What problem!

89
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,000
The other day, you said you lacked the tool.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, what's the problem today?

91
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,640
My friend broke the camera...

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
What? It's broken?

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
It's broken? You, dumbass!

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,440
Just one camera, you can't even look after it.

95
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,440
You're a mess.

96
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Go fix it now. The words have spread out.

98
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Don't you embarass me, understood?

99
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Dear, dear...

100
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,080
Greasy!

101
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
Have you got the money for my camera?!

102
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Not yet...

103
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,680
But I'm trying to...

104
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,240
And will it be finished in time?
The movie must be shown next month.

105
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,160
We haven't even started shooting yet.

106
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Por!

107
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,920
Calm down.

108
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
I give you one week.

109
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,320
If you can't find the money to fix the camera
or get me a new one...I won't let you go.

110
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Tee.

111
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Why is my pay so low?

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
You got me just one account.
You're lucky you got paid.

113
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,080
If you want more money, find more people
to open the bank accounts, that's it.

114
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,080
I've tried. I don't know lots of people.

115
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,280
The only friends I have are...

116
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
What are you trying to do?

117
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Nothing.

118
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Well, I really don't know many people.

119
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,080
Tee, please, help me.

120
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Or I'll be doomed, really.

121
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,280
I've helped you a lot already, Greasy.

122
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,280
If you're gonna have those bank accounts,
you gotta be responsible for them, I'm out.

123
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Tee.

124
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Guys.

125
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,080
I see that we're about to shoot a movie.

126
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,000
Each team will be busy preparing their work.

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,600
So I think if we open bank accounts for each team,
it may be a good idea.

128
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
Because we'll be able to transfer the money
for each team's expenses separately.

129
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,320
It'll be easier, this way. We'll know how much money each team spends,
and we won't have to wait for just a person to manage.

130
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,960
That sounds complicating.
Why do we have to open so many accounts?

131
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,680
That's true. Just one is enough,
and each team can withdraw the money from that account.

132
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
And we can summarize the expenses day by day, isn't that better?

133
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Mmm.

134
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,400
Non might think this is the best way.

135
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Or he wouldn't mention it to us.

136
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,120
We could try. If it doesn't work,
we can continue using the accounts or we can close them.

137
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,240
I agree with Greasy.

138
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,160
What are you talking about, Tee?

139
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,600
Will that work?

140
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm too lazy to summarize each team's expenses.

141
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,160
Just thinking about shooting takes a whole day.

142
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,480
And the director wouldn't do this kind of thing by himself, would he?

143
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm not saying that you gotta do it yourself.

144
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,160
Just separate the accounts for the incomes and expenses.

145
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
In the end, Greasy will summarize the accounts and show them to you guys.

146
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
But I think it's complicating.

147
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,280
I'll watch Greasy myself.

148
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,280
The flow of the money. How it's used.
He must tell me everything. Okay?

149
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Alright, alright.
If you're gonna watch him, I'm okay with it.

150
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,240
How about the others? Any thoughts?

151
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,320
I'm alright with that. It's managable.

152
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Good. Then open the bank accounts
and give the books and the ATM cards to Greasy.

153
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Sending a message to Tee "Transfer completed."

154
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Yes? Come in.

155
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Thanks. You sent it in before other people as usual, Non.

156
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Wait.

157
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Yes, sir?

158
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Is there anything troubling you?

159
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,800
You can tell by just looking at my face?

160
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
If you're not blind, even looking from outside of school,
anyone can tell that something's troubling you.

161
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
So, tell me. What is it?

162
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,840
It's alright, sir. I don't want to trouble you.

163
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,680
Trouble? Or do you think I'll scold you?

164
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,680
I'm not a teacher at your school
so I won't punish you or deduct your points.

165
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,800
Er...

166
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
C'mon, tell me.

167
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,080
Well, I do a part-time job with Tee.

168
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Actually, I don't really wanna do it.

169
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Do you need some money?

170
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440
I guess I'll find a way out somehow.

171
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,560
If there's anything I can do, let me know.

172
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you. Just having someone who listens to me, that makes me glad.

173
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm always here for you. Don't worry too much.

174
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,760
Why do I only get this amount? How about my friend's?

175
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,880
I can't give it to you yet. I got deducted a lot.

176
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,080
Find more bank accounts.

177
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,400
Or find a way to earn money.

178
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,280
I've heard that your friends are making a moive that's about to be shown...

179
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,760
Can you find a way to get more money then?

180
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,640
What would you like me to do?

181
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,840
Have my money laundered.

182
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,160
But...

183
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm losing my profit more and more each day.

184
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,480
If you're not doing anything about it, you will lose your part too.

185
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
And I can't help you with anything.

186
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,480
Tee to Top: I need a favor.

187
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Tee, why didn't I get the money this time?

188
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,080
You only manage a few accounts.

189
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,760
One more thing, the money hasn't got to the customer yet.
How will the money come from?

190
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,280
You said you would transfer the money to me everyday.

191
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I only got it on the first day, and I haven't got the rest.

192
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,240
You said if I did as you said, I would get the money.

193
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,280
Why are you being so loud? Huh?

194
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Do you want other people to know what the fuck you're doing now?

195
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,240
Well, I work for money. I only ask for my shares.

196
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
You're full of dramas.

197
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,000
You broke Por's camera, and I got you a job.

198
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So don't mess with me, okay?

199
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,000
Por: Don't forget to transfer the money for the camera for me today.

200
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Por: Or you'll be a dead man.

201
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
Damn it!

202
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,680
Hey, hey, hey, where are you guys? I need a hand.

203
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Yeah, we're on our way.

204
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Shit, I'm fucked.

205
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,320
Por, help me...

206
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,560
Alright, be there in a bit.

207
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,840
Fuck.

208
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,080
Again, Por?

209
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Greasy just transfered the money for the camera.

210
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,160
What? Really?

211
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,080
How could he find that amount of money so fast?

212
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,880
I don't know. All I know is we can continue shooting now.

213
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
Shit!

214
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
I wanna go today!

215
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,320
What are you waiting for then?
Let's do it tomorrow. It's Saturday.

216
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,200
Yeah! Do it!

217
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,760
Yes.

218
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
Then, see you tomorrow.
Prepare yourselves.

219
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,360
Alright.

220
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,160
Go ahead.

221
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,760
Let's continue.

222
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
Alright, alright.

223
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,640
Top, you suck.

224
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Well, you didn't help me.

225
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,880
Damn, the way is so steep.

226
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,160
Where are we now, Uncle?

227
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,160
We'll be there in a bit.
Turn left at the intersection and we'll arrive.

228
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,720
What?

229
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
What's wrong with the car?

230
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Did the tire break?

231
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,960
I don't know.

232
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,560
Por, go check it.

233
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Alright, alright.

234
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Fluke, hold this.

235
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,640
Uncle, what's wrong with the car?

236
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I don't know too. Everything seems normal.

237
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,440
Fuck!

238
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,840
Hey, Fluke!

239
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
What's wrong, Fluke?

240
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,800
What is it?

241
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,520
I saw something.

242
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,080
What?

243
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,840
It's like...a ghost.

244
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,840
But, there's blood in its eyes.

245
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,040
Fuck!

246
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
What's wrong, Top?

247
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,600
I saw that too.

248
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,760
Hey.

249
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,960
You saw the same thing, right, Top?

250
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,400
The masked ghost, right?

251
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,560
Yes.

252
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,000
It's got long hair, holding an axe and walking towards me, Fluke.
It's about to kill me for sure. Fuck!

253
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Fuck!

254
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Fuck!

255
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,600
Shit, the mask.

256
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Hey, go!

257
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,760
Fuck! The mask.

258
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,480
What are you waiting for, Fluke? Go! Go!

259
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,280
Hey, wait for me too!

260
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,320
Help me!

261
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Come back and help me!

262
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Hey, come back!

263
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Hey, hey, hey! Keep running!

264
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
I saw it too.

265
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
You saw it too, right?

266
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,840
What are you shooting, Por?
You didn't give me any signal.

267
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,840
You see. I looked bad from this angle.

268
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,360
Bad my ass.

269
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,360
You and Non can show your face. And, who sees me?

270
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,760
Fuck. I was wearing the mask the whole time.

271
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,120
Hey, but you did well. I like that.

272
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,320
Right, I've told you. This role belongs to you.

273
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
This suits you the best, Tee.
Your expression was just great.

274
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,200
Of course, I suit any roles that I get.

275
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,160
I saw something.

276
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,560
I want the movie to be released soon.

277
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,360
I wannna show it off to other people.

278
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Right, I want to make money from it already.

279
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,920
I think we will make so much money from the news that spread out.

280
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Por, it could earn us milions of Baht.

281
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,280
You wish for millions, Tee?

282
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Well, you gotta dream big!
You won't get too surprised if we get the money.

283
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,360
People love this genre of movie. Don't you know that, Por.

284
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Cut!

285
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
That was really good.

286
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
And who's doing the cutting?

287
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Not me, I'm the director.

288
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Hey, I don't know how to use the program either.

289
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm busy.

290
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Then you do it, Greasy.

291
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
But...

292
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,360
But...your ass! Take it and finish the cutting so it'll be shown on time.

293
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,480
The money will get to us soon.
Don't you want it?

294
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Okay, I'll help Non so it'll be finished faster.

295
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Your call, man.

296
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,240
Let's try these two and put them together...

297
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
It would have more dynamic.

298
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I think this one is nice.

299
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Yes, but we gotta choose or it will be too hard for us to cut...
and the story won't continue.

300
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
How about this one, Jin?
Everyone looks good, not too surprised.

301
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Or do you not like it?

302
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Which one do you like?

303
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,640
If we don't choose anything, it won't be finished.

304
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Jin.

305
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Huh?

306
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Which footage should we get from this cut?

307
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Then...the one that they're telling a story?

308
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
Maybe, this one.

309
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Everyone seems to do a great job. As good as it gets.

310
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Non, do you want to check on that?
I saw the messages kept popping up.

311
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I'll do this by myself first.

312
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
Then, just one sec.

313
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,600
Tee: Transfer Schedule.

314
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,840
Tee: This time, we'll transfer it to the customers.

315
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
Tee: Do it at the exact time I tell you.

316
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,280
Tee: Lately, the cops have caught lots of these accounts.

317
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,800
Tee: Boss doesn't want them to reach us.

318
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Shit.

319
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Are you alright?

320
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Huh?

321
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,800
You seem stressed. Is there anything?

322
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
No, nothing.

323
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,080
I'm done with this.
Let's continue on our work.

324
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Come on.

325
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,800
You got that too, Por?

326
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Yeah.

327
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I did too. What did I do?

328
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
What's up, guys?

329
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,240
We got a warning about having our bank accounts checked.

330
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I think this is Greasy's doing for sure.
He opened the accounts for us.

331
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Non wouldn't do that.
Don't jump to conclusion just yet.

332
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,440
We'll ask him when we meet him
and then we'll figure out what to do next.

333
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Alright, we'll ask him.
I wanna know it too.

334
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,080
And where is Greasy?
Is he absent or something?

335
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,120
I haven't seen him either.

336
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I called him, but he didn't answer.

337
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Maybe Non did the cutting till late and he woke up late.

338
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,280
The cutting? That's insane.

339
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
I think he wants to avoid us.

340
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,400
That Greasy...my Dad scolded me this morning.

341
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,120
How about you two?
Didn't you get the warning?

342
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,600
Well...

343
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I don't know. I didn't get there in time
so I didn't open the account.

344
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
I haven't checked it at my home yet.

345
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Shit!

346
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Damn Greasy!

347
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,160
How did you teach your friend?
Why did it turn out like this?

348
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I'm sorry.

349
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,240
If the cops get to you, and you say you're sorry,
won't they put you in jail?

350
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,600
Be careful with whatever you do.
Do you know that your friend transfered the money?

351
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
No. I don't know anything about that, really.

352
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Then you must know what to do with your friend.

353
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Yes, sir.

354
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Hey!

355
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Hey, Tee.

356
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,400
Get up!

357
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Come here.

358
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Tee...

359
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Greasy, why the hell did you do that?

360
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Haven't I told you already what's going to happen
if you withdraw the money from the customer's account?

361
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,920
I need the money.

362
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Everyone needs money.

363
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Tee, please don't do anything to me, I'm begging you.

364
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Greasy, you gotta find a way to pay back the money
or else you gotta sell your organs.

365
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Do you want that to happen?

366
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:12,920
And about the cops, just confess, so boss won't kill you.

367
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
C'mon.

368
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Non, where are you rushing to again today?

369
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Don't get into any troubles.

370
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,760
You don't have to say that. I know it.

371
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Found him?

372
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Nothing?

373
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
There, sergeant. Right?

374
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,560
Yes, yes! Hey, young man. Wait.

375
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,160
Wait up, young man, just hold on.

376
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,160
Are you Mr. Tanakorn Prateepsit?

377
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
Is there anything?

378
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Let's have a talk for a bit.

379
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,640
Over there, I have something to talk to you.

380
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,400
This way.

381
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,040
I don't know anything.

382
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,880
That account, my friend told me to open it.

383
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,160
Non had me and our friends open the bank accounts.

384
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,160
And he said that it would be easier to control the budget for the film shooting.

385
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Is there any more to ask?
We're fooled by Non. We are the victims here.

386
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,880
So you intended to fool your friends to open horse accounts?

387
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,800
And have these accounts to run the money?

388
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Yes.

389
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Are you doing this by yourself?
Or are there other people?

390
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
No. This is all my doing, just me.

391
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:55,360
You're just a high school student.
It's too big for you to do alone.

392
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Who's behind this?

393
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,480
I'm doing this alone.
There are no other people.

394
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Mom, help me. I know nothing and I'm not involved.

395
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,760
You must be very scared. It's alright. You were fooled.
The inspector will help you out.

396
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,600
How are you going to handle this, inspector.

397
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,920
You don't have to worry, sir.

398
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,920
About this, Mr. Por has no part in it.

399
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,000
Mr. Por is just a victim.

400
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
If what you're saying is true, then it's all good.

401
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,240
Thank you, inspector, for helping my son out.

402
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,840
You're welcomed to dine at our place.

403
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh, it's totally nothing, sir.

404
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,480
Excuse me, excuse me.

405
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,360
Where is the student that's brought here?

406
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,960
Is his name Non?

407
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,400
Yes. I'm his mother.

408
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,600
Please release my son. I wanna see him.

409
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Oh, so it's you, the mom whose son almost got my son into jail.

410
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,160
Teach your son to behave.

411
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,160
If he can commit money laundering at this age,
what would he do when he grew up?

412
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,040
There's a saying to have a kid when you're ready.

413
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,520
Or they would grow up to be a scum like this.

414
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Don't.

415
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,240
C'mon, if you dare.
You will both get into jail, Mom and Son!

416
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Do you think I'll be in trouble with this kind of thing?

417
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
I've never asked anything from you.

418
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,200
Why did you do it?

419
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,560
This is so embarassing, do you know that?

420
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,880
I can't even walk into town.

421
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,880
If it's too much for you,
do you want to quit school, or maybe move?

422
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,160
And then we can figure something out.

423
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,000
You always find an easy way out for him.

424
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,680
Are you trying to teach him to be a loser like you?

425
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,280
You could never make things right.

426
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,400
What would you like me to do?

427
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,920
I never could satisfy you.

428
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,720
You can't blame me for having a son like this.

429
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,400
You're so pushy.

430
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
Who would be able to put up with you?

431
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,360
And that's my fault?

432
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,360
If you think you can raise our child better,
why don't you quit your job and raise him?

433
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,160
Shut up!

434
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,960
I won't! Have you ever helped me raise our child?

435
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,520
You went out to work.
Has it ever crossed your mind that I have to work too?

436
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,400
I told you to stop! Stop it!

437
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
No!

438
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,640
Ooh, here he comes.

439
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,960
Sir, may we have an interview?

440
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,280
Sir.

441
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Sir, may we have an interview?

442
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,320
Everyone may know that my son was involved with money laundering.

443
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,200
But the truth is that the police has found out...

444
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
my son is not a part in this.

445
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,120
He's just a victim that has been fooled.

446
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,920
You all may be concerned that my son's short film has money laundering involved.

447
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,480
I guarantee you with my reputation and my job

448
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:36,200
that our family has nothing to do with money laundering at all.

449
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Excuse me.

450
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Hold on...mister.

451
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Fuck, what are we going to do next?

452
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,760
I'll continue the shooting.

453
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Hey, don't you think we should let things quiet down first?

454
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,600
Right now, there's so much shit going on.

455
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
No!

456
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600
If we don't finish shooting, people will think
that my family is involved with these horse accounts.

457
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,880
If we continue, it will prove that
my family has nothing to do with it.

458
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,760
That includes all of you.

459
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,760
If we don't do it, people will start talking.

460
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Alright, I'm in. I wanna finish it too.

461
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Me too.

462
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Alright, then let's finish it.

463
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Non, where are you?
You don't answer my calls. You don't answer my texts.

464
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,080
Did you call a Grab?

465
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes.

466
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,760
I'll make a U-turn real quick.

467
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Alright.

468
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
Excuse me, could you go faster?

469
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Non.

470
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Non.

471
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Non.

472
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Non.

473
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,640
Non, Non.

474
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I'm sorry.

475
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm so sorry.

476
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,560
I can't be your friend with benefit anymore.
Can we be a couple?

477
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,240
That kid isn't a part of the horse accounts and the scammer gang.

478
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
He's just a victim.

479
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,280
How did you manage to make the cop say that?

480
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,280
You confessed and how could you become just a victim?
Are you the cop's spy?

481
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,400
I really don't like how you got close to those people.

482
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,520
Are they really your friends?

483
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,520
That amount of money in exchange of your life, I think it's worth it.

484
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,800
The more they complain, the more famous we're gonna get.

485
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
Shit.

486
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:42,600
Hey, there's some news online about our film...what are they saying?

487
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,400
Shit, is this really happening?

488
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,760
And...are they gonna put my pic on there?

489
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,040
Like, my face...here...

490
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:49,880
Cut!

491
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,600
Damn, that's long.

492
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,600
So messed up.

493
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,960
Fucking messed up.

494
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
I'm alright with that. It's easy.

495
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,160
Good.

496
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,600
Let's do it again.

497
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,600
I'm okay, I think it's manageable.

498
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,680
Good, then go open the accounts.

499
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,840
And get an ATM bankbook.

500
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,720
And give the bankbooks and ATM to Greasy.

501
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,440
Keep rolling, say it again one more time.

502
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,440
More determined. Like you got a plan. And, action!

503
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,160
Good, then go open the accounts.

504
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,000
And give ATMs and bankbooks to Greasy.

505
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:32,800
Again, again.

506
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,280
Good, then go open the accounts.

507
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,280
And give ATMs and bankbooks to Greasy.

508
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,600
I'll help Non, so it'll be done faster.

509
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Cut! Fluke's line is missing.

510
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Action!

511
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,040
Hey! Help! Come back and help me!

512
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Cut!

513
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,800
Shit, these people were so good.
I thought they were really scared.

514
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Uncle, you're very good too.

515
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,200
Non.

516
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Sorry. I thought you've taken them.

517
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
Non.

518
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Non.

519
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,920
What are you doing, Non?

520
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:42,920
Cut! End slate!

521
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,880
Did it get to your teeth? Sorry.

522
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,120
Good. Cut. Go!

523
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,960
End slate.

524
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,400
Do it again. You can close your eyes.
Like close them but still be able to wink.

525
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
Hold on, one sec.

526
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Don't smile.

527
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,080
Focus, focus.

528
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,560
Here we go. End slate.
