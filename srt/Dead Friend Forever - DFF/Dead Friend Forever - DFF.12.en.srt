2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,880
Yesterday, the plot you told us about...

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,040
We really liked it...

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,880
so we wanted to have you as our screenwriter of our short movie.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
in order to get the budget for the contest.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
You come with us to continue at our tutoring school.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,960
I'll pay for the course for you.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,520
If there's anything to be fixed, you can do it.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,680
And the team that is chosen is...

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,800
The Hidden Character.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
Director Por's filming set...

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,080
is ready.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,960
No! He would kill me if he knew.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,080
Help me, Tee!

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,600
We want you in the production team as well.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Would that be alright?

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
Grab the camera. I'll teach you.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,840
You go ahead and tell your parents to pay me back now!

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,200
I have a way for you to easily earn big money.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,520
Your job is to transfer money to the accounts that I send you every day.

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,560
Once the money reaches the clients' accounts, your job's done.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,520
Greasy just transfered the money for the camera.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,240
What?

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,760
We can continue shooting now.

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,200
Fuck!

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,039
Hey, Fluke!

27
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,039
What's wrong, Fluke?

28
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,160
We got a warning...

29
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,080
about having our bank accounts checked.

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,400
Non wouldn't do that.

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Don't jump to conclusion just yet.

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,440
You gotta find a way to pay back the money...

33
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,160
or else you gotta sell your organs.

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,400
I don't know anything.

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,840
That account, my friend told me to open it.

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
Non had me and our friends open the bank accounts.

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,240
We were fooled by Non.

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Why did you do it?
This is so embarassing, do you know that?

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
Non.

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Non. Non.

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,960
That kid isn't a part of the grey horse accounts.

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
He's just a victim.

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,720
It's alright. You're with me now.

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
I'll help you.

45
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,039
Fluke, yesterday, I didn't...

46
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,280
Hey, what the hell, Jin?

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,680
What are you talking about?

48
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,640
I know nothing.

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,039
Can you forgive me?

50
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,880
You want me to forgive you?

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,120
Just get lost and die.

52
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Hey!

53
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,960
You took me to open the horse account.

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,680
These two are forced to disappear.

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,040
Hello, my name is Phee.

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,440
My name is Tan.

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,920
I will make all of those assholes tell the truth.

58
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
We shouldn't have continued to shoot that movie.

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,079
Why would you wake him up?

60
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,880
But New, this is getting out of control.

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,360
We had a deal that we'd do justice for Non.

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,880
Not drugging other people to kill each other.

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
I knew already.

64
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,280
A guy like you didn't really love my brother.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,280
You all must die.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't.

67
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,600
Don't come any closer.

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,120
It wasn't me.

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,320
I didn't do it.

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,880
A guy like Fluke only cares about himself.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
He wouldn't care if someone dies.

72
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,360
When Greasy disappeared, he said he wasn't involved.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you believe that?

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
Who would believe that?

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,960
Bullshit.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,440
He's selfish.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:44,840
He only cares about himself.

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,480
You must be punished.

79
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,480
You can never be a doctor.

80
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Shit.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Don't come in.

82
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't come any closer.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,400
No!

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Camera.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Camera.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,640
Hey, Top!

87
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,160
Shit!

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,320
Did you tell other people?

89
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
You'll expose me, won't you?

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,400
No.

91
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
I know you saw it.

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Fuck off!

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Shit!

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Where are you going?

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
Where are you going, Fluke?

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Where are you off to?

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Let go!

98
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Fuck, Non...

99
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,720
Your video with that fucking tutor,

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
it's totally Jin's doing. I didn't do it.

101
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,720
But you didn't stop him.

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,920
It's like killing me alive.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm sorry. Can I apologize?

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,880
That means you want to take that video too.

105
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,520
No!

106
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I really didn't want to take it.

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Fucker!

108
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Film me!

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
I told you to film me!

110
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Now!

111
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,160
Film me!

112
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I didn't do anything.

113
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Film me!

114
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Now!

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Film me nicely!

116
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Do it now!

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Film me!

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Film me now!

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
Non!

120
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Don't do anything to me. I'm sorry.

121
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Please let me go! I'm sorry.

122
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
Non.

123
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Let me go.

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,040
that Tee and I planned to fool you to open horse accounts.

127
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,520
Non!

128
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
Non!

129
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Let me go!

130
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Guys.

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
What's wrong, Top?

132
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
It's Non.

133
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Ghost Non is trying to kill me.

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
And he's going to kill all of us.

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Calm down, Top.

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Non disappeared, didn't he?
How did you meet him?

137
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,640
That's right. Non just disappeared, didn't he?

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
How could he become a ghost?

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Have some water.

140
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Non. Non.

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I will not die!

142
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm not a part of this! Leave me alone, fucker!

143
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I will not die!

144
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
I'm going to be a doctor!

145
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
I can't see. How can I save people?

146
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I will not die! You, die, asshole!

147
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
What do you want me to do?

148
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,200
If you wanna help me,

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
this is the only way.

150
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,680
I can't take this anymore.

151
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I can't do it.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
But I really can't do this anymore.

153
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,960
That amount of money...

154
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Even if I work till I die, I won't be able to find that money.

155
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,640
I told you I was going to help you. Be patient.

156
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
Kill me!

157
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
No!

158
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,840
Kill me!

159
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,680
No, I can't do it.

160
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,480
Kill me!

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
I can't do it!

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,400
Don't touch me.

163
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
You're filthy, don't touch me.

164
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Tee, why are you talking to me like this?

165
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,200
I promised you I was going to wait for you for two years.

166
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,760
I never had anyone else.

167
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,000
I've changed myself. I've changed everything.

168
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But you, you could go with anyone else?

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
No, it's not like that, Tee.

170
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,360
I didn't go with anybody else. I only got you.

171
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,160
Tee.

172
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
You're so filthy. I told you to get lost!

173
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,120
If you don't wanna die,

174
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
kill me already.

175
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
I'm not like that.

176
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm not sick.

177
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Tee, don't leave me.

178
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,800
I can't do it, I can't.

179
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,720
Tee, you told me that I was your smile.

180
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Why are you being so serious?

181
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,400
Tee.

182
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,880
Let go!

183
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Tee!

184
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
I can't.

185
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Tee!

186
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Don't leave me, Tee!

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,760
Tee!

188
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Let go!

189
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
For one, please.

190
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm here everyday because of you.

191
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
A candy?

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,680
What?

193
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,000
You want it?

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're leaving me for uni.

195
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
It's fine, I think.

196
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Because I'll be waiting.

197
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
You're Non.You're Non, right?!

198
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Stop haunting me!

199
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,880
You're Non, right?!

200
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,600
You're here to haunt me, right?!

201
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,760
You're Non, right?!

202
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Answer me, Non! Answer me first! Answer!

203
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,720
Why are you haunting me, Non?

204
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
You're Non, aren't you?

205
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
Why are you haunting me, Non?

206
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
You're Non, aren't you?

207
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
Non.

208
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Non.

209
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Non.

210
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Non.

211
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Hey!

212
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Stop!

213
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Guys, stop!

214
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
Stop it!

215
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Stop it now!

216
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Stop!

217
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Stop already!

218
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Stop it, stop!

219
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
No!

220
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Non.

221
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Non.

222
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,520
Phee.

223
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,640
Phee.

224
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
If I wasn't here, you would be happy, right?

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,240
If I wasn't here, you would be happy, right?

226
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I've never thought that way.

227
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,119
Really?

228
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
Is it?

229
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Non.

230
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Phee, help me.

231
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,319
Are you gonna let me die again?

232
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Non.

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Non!

234
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Non.

235
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,640
If we wait until dark...

236
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
we will see the Milky Way.

237
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,680
Non. Non.

238
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,200
Do you want me to survive?

239
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
Non. Non. Non. I'm hurt.

240
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Why didn't you help me?

241
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,560
When you said you would protect me, you just said that, right?

242
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm sorry.

243
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I couldn't make it in time.

244
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Make it in time?

245
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
That's your excuse?

246
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I was in deep shit, and you weren't there to help me.

247
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,920
And I died.

248
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I'm sorry, Non.

249
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,320
You wanted me to get lost and die, right?

250
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Well, here I am, dead, as you wished.

251
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
How did you want me to die?

252
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
I didn't mean for this to happen, Non.

253
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I loved you, Non.

254
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,000
Loved me?

255
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You loved me? Then get lost and die!

256
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,000
No, no, no...

257
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You're not Non.

258
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Non would never say such a thing.

259
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Non would never say such a thing.

260
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
You're not Non.

261
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,240
A coward like you...

262
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,720
You're not Non.

263
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,280
Well, open your eyes and watch me die.

264
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Again.

265
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
Alright?

266
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Are you gonna let me die again?

267
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Non.

268
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Non.

269
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Non.

270
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
No!

271
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
You're not Non.

272
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Phee.

273
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,760
If I wasn't here, you would be happy, right?

274
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,640
I've never thought that way.

275
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Really?

276
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Phee, help me.

277
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
How did you want me to die?

278
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,680
No!

279
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Non.

280
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Non.

281
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Non. No, no!

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Non. Non. Non!

283
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,480
Non, Non, Non. No!

284
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,680
Non. Non, Non, Non, Non!

285
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,720
No, no!

286
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Non!

287
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,720
No, this is only a hallucination. You're not Non.

288
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,240
Non would never do such a thing.

289
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,760
You're not Non!!!

290
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,760
Are you Non?

291
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Yes.

292
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,240
What is it?

293
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,080
You're back now?

294
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Hey, what's wrong?

295
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,200
You fooled me.

296
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
This was your plan all along, right?

297
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
You wanted to know the truth about my brother, didn't you?

298
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Now, you know.

299
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Enjoy your world.

300
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
New.

301
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm guilty.

302
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,640
I didn't do it. I didn't mean it.

303
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm sorry.

305
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,640
I'm sorry. I didn't want our friends to hate me. I'm sorry.

307
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,520
Are we really not gonna stop them?

308
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
If you want to, go ahead.

309
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm sorry. I'm guilty. I know it now.

310
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

311
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,320
Jin.

312
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

313
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,880
Jin.

314
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Get up!

315
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Hurry!

316
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Non.

317
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
How are you doing?

318
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Are you studying hard?

319
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
You didn't come home.

320
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I didn't know that these things would happen.

321
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
If I knew, I wouldn't go.

322
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
So I could stay and help you.

323
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
But you always help me.

324
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
But what good it does.

325
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
You're gone.

326
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm right here all the time.

327
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
With you, all the time.

328
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
You always do everything for me, don't you?

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Thank you very much.

330
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Are you really thanking me?

331
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Good thing that I studied Computer Science.

332
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
I can't do more than this.

333
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
But I haven't done anything.

334
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
New.

335
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Non!

336
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Non!

337
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Non!

338
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Non!

339
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
It isn't true. That's not me.

340
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
I didn't do it.

341
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

342
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Are you awake now?

343
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
Wait for me here. I need to go back and help Tee.

344
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Non.

345
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Die! Die!

346
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,840
Fuck, you killed my brother, didn't you?

347
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,080
You tortured my brother?

348
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,680
Did you torture my brother, fucker?

349
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,960
Did you, asshole?

350
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,400
You, die! Die, fucker!

351
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,520
You must die, fucker!

352
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
Fuck off! Let me go!

353
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
Let me go! Let me!

354
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,240
New.

355
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,880
You must pay!

356
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,800
New.

357
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,800
My family. My brother...I got nothing left.

358
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,840
That's enough!

359
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,080
Fucker.

360
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just...I just met Non.

361
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
But he died again.

362
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I couldn't save Non.

363
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I couldn't save him.

364
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Let's stop this.

365
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
We've gone way too far.

366
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
You don't understand, Phee.

367
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I just had a talk with Non.

368
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Non wanted a revenge on these fucking assholes.

369
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
It's just a hallucination, New.

370
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,800
The real Non definitely wouldn't let you do this.

371
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,720
Non wanted me to avenge him.

372
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Non told me. That's what Non wanted.

373
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,240
Can you hear me? They all must die.

374
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,760
You all must die, fucking assholes!

375
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Let me go, fucker.

376
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Let me go!

377
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Let me go, fucker.

378
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Fucker!

379
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,480
You want me to be a bad guy, right?

380
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Fucker!

381
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Fucking asshole!

382
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I'm sorry.

383
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,320
Tee.

384
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Tee.

385
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
Tee...Tee...

386
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,400
White, why? Why?

387
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
We must leave this place, Tee.

388
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Thank you.

389
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,040
TWO YEARS LATER.

390
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,920
Hello.

391
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,520
Where are you? Why didn't you answer?

392
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,000
Are you here in Thailand now?

393
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, just arrived.

394
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,560
Are you still not done shooting?

395
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
No, not yet.

396
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,800
I'll finish around 6.

397
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,440
If you had been so busy, I shouldn't have come see you.

398
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,560
I should have stayed and finished uni.

399
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,080
If you hadn't come here, I would've flown to bring you back here.

400
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,400
Don't be mad. I'll go see you when I finish.

401
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Alright.

402
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I wanna go visit Tee.

403
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
I don't know how he's been doing.

404
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Tee?

405
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
White.

406
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
White.

407
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
White.

408
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
White.

409
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
White, White.

410
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,520
White, White.

411
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
White.

412
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
He's not better.

413
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,400
I feel sorry for him. He killed his lover with his own hands.

414
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400
He must feel guilty for the rest of his life.

415
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
I wanna help him.

416
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
But I don't know how.

417
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,040
No one can help him.

418
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He must get through this by himself.

419
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
I don't know who hurts more,...

420
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,240
the one that's already gone...

421
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
or the one that still lives.

422
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
But we've got through that.

423
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,000
Thank you...

424
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,280
for still being with me.

425
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,680
Well, I...thank you too

426
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:48,680
for forgiving me everything I've done in the past.

427
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Phee.

428
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Why are going to the water?

429
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Jin.

430
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,199
That day, at the valley mansion,

431
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,199
how did we get out?

432
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,639
I don't know.

433
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,719
I can't remember that part too.

434
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,040
We just...got out.

435
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,679
And lived on, normally.

436
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,320
But lots of our friends died.

437
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,960
No news.

438
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,560
No investigation.

439
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,840
No fucking things about that valley house.

440
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
How is that possible?

441
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
What are you trying to say?

442
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,719
The reason we couldn't remember how we got out of that house...

443
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,280
may be because...

444
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
we never left that house.

445
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,800
I can't see. How can I save people?

446
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I won't die! You, die, fucker!

447
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
Tan, walk in.

448
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,880
The two, move.

449
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Move, move.

450
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
They both fell?

451
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
They did.

452
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,040
Ready?

453
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Go!

454
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
I can't do it.

455
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
This one.

456
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Keep rolling.

457
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
And action!

458
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,960
I can't do it. / Tee.

459
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,520
I can't do it.

460
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
Tee.

461
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Don't.

462
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,400
Can you hear me?

463
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
I can't do it. Don't!

464
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Adding some blood here.

465
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,360
Tee.

466
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,320
I can't do it. I can't do it.

467
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Tee, don't leave me.

468
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Non.

469
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
To your right.

470
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
Right.

471
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,640
No, no, no. Your body.

472
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,160
The whole body.

473
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,760
More, more. more.

474
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,320
Your hand, down.

475
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
A little up.

476
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
A little more.

477
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Just a bit more.

478
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,360
So starting from here?

479
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,160
Can I mark it?

480
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Go ahead. You do it.

481
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
Got the spot, right? Alright, keep roll.

482
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Non.

483
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
Phee.

484
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
If I wasn't here, you would be happy, right?

485
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
I've never thought that way.

486
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Non!

487
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,680
Phee, help me!

488
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,240
Barcode

489
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,080
Hey!

490
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,480
Cut, cut!

491
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,800
Non. Non.

492
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
Oh, my arm...

493
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,040
Let go. He's pulling you. So let go.

494
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
You wanted to know the truth about my brother, didn't you?

495
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Now, you know.

496
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,080
What's the next line?

497
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,520
It's just a hallucination, New.

498
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,280
The real Non definitely wouldn't let you do such a thing.

499
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
What's the next line?

500
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,040
Non wanted a revenge.

501
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,000
Let me go, asshole!
