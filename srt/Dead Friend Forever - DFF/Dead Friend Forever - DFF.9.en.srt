2
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,560
I've found the casino entrance.

3
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,480
But I couldn't get in.

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Hey!

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,400
Everyone died in suffering.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,120
You took me to open the horse account.

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,760
You used me. I almost went to jail.

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
Are we gonna let him do that?

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
Do you know where Non and Mr. Keng are?

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
These two are forced to disappear.

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
What does it mean, Dad?

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
You know so well what you did three years ago.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Fluke!

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Shit, give it here.

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Asshole!

16
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,360
Fluke!

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Get off me.

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
The gun...

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,720
Tee, just forget about the gun.

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,720
But if we get the gun, we can control the situation.

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
How's your arm?

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
I can't even move it.

23
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Is there water here?

24
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll go find some.

25
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Here you go.

26
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
Thanks.

27
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,720
I'm not thirsty yet. I'll keep it for you.

28
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Why are you being so nice to me?

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Well, you're the one that got hurt. I'm alright.

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
So I gotta take care of you, isn't that right?

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
I mean, in our 12th grade,

32
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,640
back then I thought I was pretty clear with how I felt with you.

33
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,360
But you still insisted that we're just friends.

34
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
You know, I felt so lost.

35
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, now that we don't know if we'll be able to get out of here...

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,640
Tell me, about your reason...

38
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,640
of hanging me that way...what's that all about?

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
Because you like Tan.

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,800
How many times have I told you this? I don't like Tan!

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I've never had any feelings towards him.

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,840
But you seem very close to Tan.
You went everywhere together.

43
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,280
And when I asked, you always avoided the question.

44
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Okay.

45
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:01,160
Well, I..., I....

46
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,040
Hey, Jin.

47
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,040
It's my fault, it's my fault.

49
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
It's all my fault.

50
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Jin, what's wrong? Jin!

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm sorry.
Shit.

52
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

53
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Something in the water too?

54
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Hey, Jin, it's alright. Stay calm.

55
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,480
It's all my fault. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
It's just a hallucination. It's not real.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,640
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

58
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,680
Jin, listen to me.

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
It's only a hallucination, Jin.

61
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's my fault.

62
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,840
Jin, calm down. Calm down. It's not your fault.

63
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Jin.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm sorry. It's because of me who makes you like this.

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Since we don't know if we're gonna get out of here or not,

66
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I'll tell you everything.

67
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,400
You want me to forgive you?

68
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Just get lost and die.

69
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Have you ever helped anyone, and they betray you?

70
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Yes, a lot of them.

71
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,440
And what did you do to those people?

72
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
If they betray us, we talk to them.

73
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,840
If they misunderstand us, we give them the right information.

74
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,960
But if we know that their intention is to betray us,

75
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,960
we step back and never get involved with those people again.

76
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,560
That means I gotta go talk to him?

77
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,640
Yes.

78
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,640
But you gotta talk to him when your mind is ready.

79
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
No. No talking.

80
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't even wanna look at his face.

81
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,280
But don't take too long.

82
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,120
Or it would end up like your mom and I.

83
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
In the end, we didn't come to an understanding.

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Non.

85
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Non.

86
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Non.

87
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Non.

88
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,080
INT. / Vacation home / Night.

89
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,880
The masked murderer was holding an axe, cornering everyone.

90
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,200
He spoke with pain and resentment.

91
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,160
"I won't take this anymore."

92
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,080
"You all will have to die."

93
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,600
"You framed me so much that it ruined my life."

94
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,840
"My friend fooled me to do the dirty work to find money."

95
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,640
"Someone leaked my video."

96
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,440
"Betrayed me."

97
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,200
"Even my boyfriend left me."

98
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,400
"I've got nothing else left."

99
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,160
"Except my wrath, that will cost your blood."

100
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Phee.

101
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,440
How did you get here?

102
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Hello.

103
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm here to see Non, Mom.

104
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,760
The door was left open, so I walked up here.

105
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,200
Non's not here. He went to shoot a movie with his friends.

106
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,440
Didn't Non tell you, Phee?

107
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,040
No.

108
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,440
Why can't I reach him at all?

109
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I only know that there's no phone and internet service at the setting.

110
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,680
But he'll come back soon.

111
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Okay, thank you very much.

112
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,080
Next time, ring the bell first, Phee.

113
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,080
If you got in suddenly like this, I'd think you're a thief.

114
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm really sorry about that.

115
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,040
According to the news in the social media

116
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,960
about the leaked video between the tutor and the student,

117
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,320
the boy's family called the police

118
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,960
because the boy has mysteriously vanished.

119
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,880
No one has been able to contact him for one week.

120
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,000
Sir.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
How's the process now?

122
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
We, the police...

123
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,080
have contacted Missing Persons Unit.

124
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,200
One thing that we're suspecting now is that...

125
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,800
because the other person in the leaked video...

126
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,680
New: Are you Non's boyfriend?

127
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,240
also vanished in the same period,

128
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,400
New: What happened to Non?

129
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,400
we still have to keep the assumption that these two are together.

130
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,120
What is the possibility that...

131
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,000
Phee: Who's this?

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,280
the said people are still alive?

133
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Please excuse me on this....

134
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
because the other person in the leaked video...

135
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,560
also vanished in the same period,

136
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,560
we still have to keep the assumption that these two are together.

137
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Phee.

138
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
New, have you read the script that I sent you?

139
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes.

140
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,880
It's so much different from the one I watched earlier.

141
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
So that means, Non's script that you sent me...

142
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,080
wasn't used in shooting...

143
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
That's right.

144
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,640
I know Non well.

145
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,080
When he was little, whenever he had anything,

146
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,800
he would write in down or drew something.

147
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:30,360
And I think Non would like to tell us what had happened to him.

148
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,480
But why wouldn't Non...tell us directly...

149
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
what really happened to him?

150
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
It might be too dangerous.

151
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Mom.

152
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Why are you crying?

153
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,400
New, you're back from the cinema?

154
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Yes.

155
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,120
So you're going back to England tomorrow, right?

156
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
We're sorry. You came back home,

157
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,800
but we didn't spend time with you, New.

158
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,720
It's alright, Mom. It's alright.

159
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
About Non, it's a big deal.

160
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I, myself, want to know what really happened to him.

161
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,080
Are you writing a novel again?

162
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
Yeah.

163
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,040
ONE YEAR BEFORE NON DISAPPEARED

164
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
What are you writing now?

165
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
You don't have to know that.

166
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
I might sell it for other people to read.

167
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
So you'll get more buyers.

168
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Well, why do you care?

169
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Before, you never really paid attention to me.

170
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,560
When I sent you something to read, you never read it.

171
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,240
When I asked something, you never replied.

172
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Well, I was busy with the exam for the scholarship.

173
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
That's what I'm about to tell you now.

174
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
I got the scholarship to go study in England.

175
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Oh? Congrats.

176
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Aren't you sad that I'll go abroad for a very long time?

177
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
No.

178
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Whether you're here or not, it doesn't make any difference.

179
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm sorry.

180
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
For never being a good brother.

181
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,440
How about this? When I come back to visit next time,

182
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,560
I'll get you the most delicious snack in England.

183
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Of if you have any problems, you can always call me.

184
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Okay?

185
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,640
When you get to the airport, call me.

186
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I will, Mom.

187
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Safe travels, Son.

188
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
To the airport, right?

189
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No, not the airport.

190
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,320
Today I have an annoucement to make.

191
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
We have 2 new students.

192
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,920
New students. In 12th grade?

193
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Please, both of you, introduce yourselves to the class.

194
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,320
Hello, my name is Phee.

195
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,240
It's alright with me because I really am a 12th grader.

196
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,240
But if you get caught, that's gonna be a big deal.

197
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,360
About that, I've thought it through.

198
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,320
From now on, don't call me New.

199
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
What should I call you then?

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Hello, my name is Tan.

201
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
I really want to know where Non has gone.

202
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
If something really happens,

203
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,640
you won't have to take responsibility with me.

204
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Just continue and finish the school, alright?

205
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Tee, to the ball.

206
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
Where did you shoot?

207
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
I missed.

208
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Pass.

209
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,240
The hell what you passed.

210
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
You couldn't catch it.

211
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Hey, send me the ball.

212
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
What's your name again?

213
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
My name is Phee.

214
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm Tan.

215
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Come and play with us.

216
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
C'mon, we're short.

217
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,160
Come!

218
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Rock, paper, scissors, if you lose, you're on that team.
If you win, you're on mine.

219
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Rock, paper, scissors.

220
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Okay.

221
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Go.

222
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Damn it.

223
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,200
Are you alright?

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm fine, I'm fine.

225
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Are you okay?

226
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Man...

227
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Thank you.

228
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Alright, let's go.

229
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,520
Hey, Phee, Tan...

230
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
You two knew each other before?

231
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
No, I knew him the day that we reported to the school.

232
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,560
That's weird. Why did you transfer when you're a 12th grader?

233
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Mmm.

234
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,520
My parents moved to work here in all of a sudden, so I had to move too.

235
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Yeah, same here.

236
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Hey, are you the ones who made the short movie, Janta?

237
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
About the murder, right?

238
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah, you know that one?

239
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
Yeah, I got to see it too.

240
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
The plot is phenomenal.

241
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Who wrote the script?

242
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I did.

243
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,280
But actually, we helped each other from the beginning.

244
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,080
Wow, Por. You're fucking awesome.

245
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,000
The plot is fucking phenomenal.

246
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Yeah, it's awesome.

247
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
And where did you get the idea?

248
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I think we should hurry up, finish our meal and get going.

249
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Let's go.

250
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Hey, we're in the school area.

251
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
No one will see it.

252
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,240
That Por, he's a fucking liar.

253
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,040
He claimed that he wrote the script all by himself.

254
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,040
But actually, my bro was the one who wrote it.
How could he fucking say that?

255
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,920
But truth is, the script that we read and what we saw,
they're not the same.

256
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,160
Maybe Por fixed it himself later?

257
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Phee, those are fucking liars.
They are all fucking liars.

258
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,720
I put on my disguise as a new student here.

259
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
I told my parents I would go study in England.

260
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,240
I will not let all of that go for nothing.

261
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
I will have all of those assholes tell the truth.

262
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
One person seems interesting.

263
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Jin.

264
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Why? What's with Jin?

265
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Everytime we talked about Non, he seemed weird.

266
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,520
And I asked everyone in the class.

267
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,520
They said that Jin was the closest to Non.

268
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
I think he might know something that we don't.

269
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
That's good.

270
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,680
You go try to be his best friend.

271
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
And if he slips something, don't forget to tell me about it.

272
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Alright.

273
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
What are you doing?

274
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Hey, is this a half-framed camera?

275
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
No, this is a rangefinder.

276
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Oh, I guess I might have mistaken it.

277
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Oh, is it the one that can't be snapped fast?

278
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
You're into cameras?

279
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I guess.

280
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Yeah but the pic is a bit torn.

281
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,320
In the past, I used a film to shoot a landscape movie. It's nice.

282
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Landscape? That's awesome.

283
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,800
If you go again, tag me along.

284
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Since I've moved here, I don't have any friends who are into cameras.

285
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Of course, bring the camera next time.

286
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
I'll show you tomorrow.

287
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Alright.

288
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,120
Jin.

289
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Are you okay?

290
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
Not really.

291
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Hang on, hang on.

292
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
A little bit.

293
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Tan. Tan.

294
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
"You didn't study, dumbass."

295
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,880
Eating something today?

296
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,040
Nimman? Nimman?

297
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Hey.

298
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,720
Have you waited for long?

299
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,240
Oh, sweet lovebirds.

300
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
You guys are sweet.

301
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
I've never been here. Never thought it's gonna be this beautiful.

302
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I told you it's worth the car sickness.

303
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,240
Can you see the milky way here during the night?

304
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
The thing is I've been wanting to take a photo of the milky way for a long time.

305
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Is there anything?

306
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
No, nothing.

307
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Have you ever taken anyone here before?

308
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Mostly, I would take the person I like here.

309
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Then...

310
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I guess I'm your first friend that you took here?

311
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I guess...

312
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,440
The person you took up here, how was he like?

313
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,360
He was cute.

314
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,680
He didn't talk much.

315
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,960
He might seem weird.

316
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,960
But...he's really kind-hearted.

317
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Thanks for giving me a ride.

318
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Hey, it's nothing.

319
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,000
After I develop the film, I'll show you.

320
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Alright.

321
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Then, I'll see you later?

322
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,320
Your house is pretty far away.

323
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
And...it will be pretty late to get there...

324
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Wanna spend a night at my place first?

325
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Will that be alright?

326
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't have any clothes.

327
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
It's alright. I won't do it harshly.
I don't wanna dislocate your shoulders.

328
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Who would do it until they dislocate their shoulders?

329
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Well, you can't be sure about that.

330
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Wake up.

331
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
We'll be late for school.

332
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
We'll make it. It won't take long.

333
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Did you cheat on my brother?

334
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,800
No, I didn't.

335
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
I still love and miss Non just as the same.

336
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,200
The reason I did it was because I wanted to be a part of the team.

337
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,160
I wanted to get closer to him.

338
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,160
In case he would tell me some secrets.

339
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Well, if you know something, you gotta let me know.

340
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,480
You can fuck him as many times as you want.

341
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,240
But let me warn you.

342
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
Don't fall in love with him.

343
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,920
He's with those assholes so he's also an asshole.

344
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Maybe he's the reason why my brother disappeared.

345
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Alright, I know.

346
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes, sir.

347
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Affirmative. I will hurry and finish the case file.

348
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,480
“Debt Collector is calling…”

349
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Are you alright?

350
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
The doc gave me new extra medicine.

351
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Now, I understand why Non had to take that many medicines.

352
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Officer.

353
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Someone said that there's a video where
Non and Mr. Keng were seen in a bus together.

354
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,239
That's correct.

355
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,560
May I see that video?

356
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,560
So I can confirm if it's Non, my son.

357
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Right now, we're validating that video.

358
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I think you should leave first.

359
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,400
And if I need any more information, I'll let you know again.

360
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,480
You don't seem to take my son's case seriously.

361
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,080
You're trying to close this case fast.

362
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,080
So what you're doing now is forging evidence
to confirm that my son ran away.

363
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Or maybe...maybe, my son...

364
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,080
My son...No, no, no, no...

365
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,400
The process fee that I paid wasn't enough?

366
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Non, Non...

367
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,120
Why can't we see this important evidence?

368
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,640
Why can't it be seen?

369
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Pim.

370
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,080
I don't understand what you're talking about.

371
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Non, Non, Non, Non, Non.

372
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:42,200
To Phee: I think I like you. I want us to be a couple. (deleting…)

373
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,640
To Phee: What do you think of me?

374
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,760
"News: As anticipated, the police reveals the evidence showing that
the tutor take the boy on the bus. Now charged with child abduction."

375
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Phee.

376
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Phee.

377
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
What's up?

378
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
What are you doing?

379
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Nothing.

380
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
Is there anything I can help?

381
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,160
I said there's nothing.

382
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Aren't we supposed to be able to talk to each other about everything?

383
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Or have I misunderstood something here?

384
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah.

385
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I think you have misunderstood.

386
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
Then, you tell me, so I can understand.

387
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
Hello, Phee.

388
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
You saw it?

389
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Where are you? Come see me, same spot. Now.

390
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Now?

391
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Why are you undecisive?
Are you with someone else now? Who is it?

392
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Come see me right now. We have to talk.

393
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Don't forget what we're doing here and now.

394
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Alright, I'll be there.

395
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,280
The correct thing is...

396
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,560
we're just friends.

397
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,560
But if you still want me at your place, I'm okay with that.

398
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Gotta go.

399
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,360
TWO YEARS LATER

400
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
New.

401
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Why are you calling me and telling me this today?

402
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,160
Why haven't I known before that Mom was sick?

403
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Your Mom and I thought that you're in England.

404
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,800
So we didn't want you to worry.

405
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,800
We didn't want to tell you that Mom got a depression.

406
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,880
And she's more and more depressed since Non's disappearance.

407
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
But it seems like you're not in England, right?

408
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,400
You know, Mom and I had to sell the house and sent you money.

409
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I had to run away from the debt collectors and now I have nowhere to live.

410
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Because we thought that you had expenses over there.

411
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,840
But look at this, you lied to us.

412
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
The reason I'm here is because I wanna know what happened to Non too.

413
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,920
And what good is that? I stopped searching already.

414
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,080
Your Mom took the meds and passed.

415
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,480
But that's good, so she wouldn't have to know that she got another son...

416
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,480
who's also a liar.

417
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Get lost, New.

418
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
From now on, you and I are no longer related.

419
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I thought you're a good kid.

420
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
But in the end, it seems like you got no goodness in you at all.

421
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Get out of my life.

422
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad.

423
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Dad! Dad!

424
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Dad, Dad, Dad...

425
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
New.

426
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
Non.

427
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Non.

428
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Non.

429
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
I'm sorry.

430
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Until now, I still don't know where you are.

431
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I was fooled.

432
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,640
I was framed.

433
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,440
You gotta help me expose them!

434
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,720
If you can help me, I'll forgive you...

435
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
for abandoning me.

436
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,680
Non, don't go yet.

437
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Non, come back!

438
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360
Non.

439
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Non.

440
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Non, come back!

441
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Tan.

442
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:38,760
Tan.

443
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,600
Non.

444
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,600
Tan.

445
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
Tan.

446
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,360
Non.

447
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Phee!

448
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Are you high again?

449
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,760
My family is all fucked up.

450
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,800
I got nothing left in my life anymore.

451
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Help me die, Phee.

452
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
I've got nothing left.

453
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Tan. Tan. Tan.

454
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,520
Where's the antidote?

455
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
I don't wanna live anymore...

456
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,880
Are you better now?

457
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,880
I just...

458
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
I just wanna run away from the truth and see Non.

459
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,440
I'm sorry, Phee, for worrying you.

460
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Alright, I'm better now. It's better now.

461
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,880
"Text in group chat (Administrative's Favorites - 7 members)"

462
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,920
Jin: I got some news for you all.

463
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,520
JIn: I'll go to America in three months.

464
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,160
Jin: I'll be staying there and I may not be coming back.

465
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
What the hell?

466
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,560
Por: Then, there should be a farewell party, right?

467
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,200
Por: How about this, the party at the end of the month?

468
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Por: Where do you want it to happen? Pick.

469
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,440
Tan: How about at your house, Por?

470
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Tan: The one that you shot a movie. Phee and I have never been there.

471
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,480
Por: That's good, so we can get so drunk and we won't need to give a shit.

472
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,680
Por: What do you guys think?

473
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,680
Fluke: I'm alright with anything.

474
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Top: I'm okay. How about others?

475
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Jin.

476
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
When are you gonna stop avoiding me?

477
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
I still wanna talk to you.

478
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Jin.

479
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Jin.

480
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Why did you propose a party and Por's place?

481
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,600
It's a good opportunity to use this.

482
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,720
This is an extract from the herb

483
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,640
used to brainwash people who worship Janta.

484
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,680
If you consume this extract,

485
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,040
you'll have hallucination that reveals your fear

486
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,640
or the secret hidden in your mind.

487
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,560
Some people become very strong that they could knock down an elephant.

488
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,440
But we must hurry. This herb is not so stable yet.

489
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,880
The affecting time still varies.

490
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,400
When we get to Por's place, I'll drug them.

491
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,440
And set everything just as in the short movie.

492
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,640
So it will look like it's a curse.

493
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,680
If I can get them really scared,

494
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,640
maybe they will slip the secret about Non.

495
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,120
But you gotta pick the right one, man.

496
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,120
The one with an X mark is the one with the extract.

497
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,080
But the one without an X is the antidote.

498
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
This is not deadly, is it?

499
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
This won't kill them.

500
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,200
Hey, guys!

501
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
Let go!

502
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,440
Give me back the gun!

503
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
If you have anything to tell me, do it now.

504
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,600
I'll punish the ones who hurt Non.

505
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,440
I'll punish everyone.

506
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,320
Die, you, fucking assholes.

507
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,320
I'll punish the ones who hurt Non.

508
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
Back off!

509
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,360
I'll punish the ones who hurt Non.
