00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,560
So? How's my home? You're all so stunned, aren't you?

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,239
So you're not gonna be doing anything else but drinking, three days straight?

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,000
How about this? If you're bored, then let's watch a movie.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,200
Hey, I don't think that's the one.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,920
What? What? A Porn? Phee, put that on!

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
Alright.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,760
Who wore the mask?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,040
Why haven't you ever brought him to us?

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,840
It's Non. He's not here anymore.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,600
You two got in when we were in 12th grade so you never met him.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,160
I think he might be dead already.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,240
It may not be like that.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Your friend might just move. Don't overthink.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, but I want to remake the film.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,720
Right? Making new memory...

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,360
Why do we have to actually do this?

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,720
I just don't want him to get involved with what we have done.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,640
If he finds out, and what?

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
It ended a long time ago.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,760
I just wanted to know...that why you never wanted to ask me...

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,960
what we are for all these times?

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,920
Friends, indeed.

24
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:11,880
Hey!

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,880
It's like someone's watching us...

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Who's that?

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Shit!

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Ahhhhh!

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,479
Por!

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,520
Ahhhhh!

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Hey, Por. C'mon!

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,320
Shit!

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,240
I think it's Non Ghost.

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,160
Because we continued filming the story that he wrote, it's cursed.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
And he's now killing each one of us.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
Ahhhhhh!

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,759
Did we really wake him up by continue shooting his movie?

38
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,680
Well, there was nothing before that.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Everything happened after we shot the movie.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,720
We must break the curse.

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,400
We must destroy everything that belongs to Non.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,120
Like, the hard disk.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,160
So, what really happened to the guy named Non?

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,160
What did you three do to him?

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,200
I don't know. Ask someone else.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Destroy it.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
Hey!

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
What the hell?

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you guys that scared that it turned you nuts?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,520
I'll look at it, no matter what.

51
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Hey, what if something happens after we take a look at it?
Who will be responsible?

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,760
Then, we won't look at it. We'll wait for Uncle Dang to arrive,
get us out and then we'll have a look.

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,079
Tee, we made it!

54
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,400
Uncle Dang, this way! Uncle Dang!

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
We're in a big trouble, Uncle.
You must get us out of here ASAP.

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,040
Shit, Uncle Dang!

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,240
When I saw him, he was driving in.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
When he was getting closer,...

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,120
it's just like what you saw.

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,000
What if this continues,

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the next one is going to be one of us.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the one who killed Uncle Dang and hurt Por
is still around here somewhere, right?

63
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,600
Then, I'll go out and get help.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,440
No, Top. You'll run away alone for sure.

65
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240
I wasn't running away.

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,240
If I were going to, would Tee and I turn around and come back?

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Let Top go. The way in and out is so crooked.

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Does any of us ride better than him?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey!

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,920
I don't think we should let him go alone.

71
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,360
What's the problem, Phee?
You don't trust your friend?

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Trust?

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, it was you two who were about to destroy the hard disk.

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You both hid the truth from us,
and you wanted us to trust you?

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,480
I've told you the hard disk is cursed.

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, and is it? There's proof that it isn't.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,839
Phee, why are you having so many issues with us?

78
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,840
Aren't you worried about Por, who's dying in the house.
Or do you want him dead?

79
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,080
Hey! That's enough!

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,560
How about I go with Top?

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
So Top can't run away.
Is that alright with you all?

82
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Alright.

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Hey, did you hear something?

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Nope.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
You didn't?

86
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Phee, can I have the car key?

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
Shit!

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
It's the walkie-talkie.

89
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,159
1 to 2, do you copy? This is the valley mansion.
Anyone there? Over.

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
This is the valley mansion.
We need help immediately. Over.

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,240
Is anyone there? Do you copy? Over.

92
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,760
White, if we can't reach the outsiders,
can we tune them for us to communicate?

93
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,560
Here, Tan. I've already set the channel.

94
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
If you guys don't get too far from each other, you can still talk.

95
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
So everyone will feel better.

96
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,360
Alright.

97
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
C'mon.

98
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
This is scary.

99
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Right.

100
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Man!

101
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
C'mon. Just a bit.

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Look at it.

103
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Unbelievable.

104
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,080
Three years ago, you all came here to just shoot a short film?
So determined.

105
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
No, I think Por just wanted to brag about how wealthy his family was.

106
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
If the whole valley could be bought,
I think his Dad would really buy it all.

107
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
But what could we say?
They are really rich.

108
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,680
When Por wants something, his parents give him all.

109
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,120
Just shooting a lame short movie,
they bought a hundred-thousand Baht camera for him. That's nuts!

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:39,760
Right, about a guy named Non, what happened?
Why are you all so scared of him?

111
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Or...did you do something to him?

112
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,440
Did you kill him?

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,400
I didn't kill him. No one killed anyone.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's just that one day, he disappeared.
We did nothing to him.

115
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,920
You're not lying to me, are you?

116
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Why would I like to you?
What will I get from lying to you?

117
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Well, I just saw that you're scared of him getting back at you.

118
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Alright, alright. Non and I used to have a bit of a problem.

119
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,880
But that passed a long time ago.
You don't need to know about it.

120
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Okay.

121
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Fuck, Tan.

122
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Fuck! How should we go?

123
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I guess we'll have to push it.

124
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Come help me.

125
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Damn it!

126
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Lower. Move it lower.

127
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
One. Two. Three.

128
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Let's go!

129
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Okay.

130
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
C'mon, harder!

131
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
We're almost there.

132
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Go. One, two...

133
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
C'mon. A bit more.

134
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
So what should we do with Uncle Dang's body?
We can't leave him like that.

135
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,800
Let's do what we gotta do.
I feel sorry for him.

136
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,560
I think we should carry his body into the house.

137
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
It's the least we can do.

138
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Okay, let's do it.

139
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
No!

140
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Don't touch Uncle Dang's body.

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,160
What if our fingerprints got on his body...or even DNA?

142
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,160
And there's an autopsy, we all will be doomed.

143
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Then, burn him, so there won't be any fingerprints and the body.

144
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Are you out of your mind?
You're just gonna burn him, just like that?

145
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
You treat him as if he's not a human being.

146
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,160
One more thing, we still don't know who did this to Uncle Dang.

147
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,880
Don't you wanna find the killer?

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:46,920
That's right, Tee. You can't do that.
This is considered concealment of the body.

149
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,440
But we can't leave him like this. What if his corpse attracts somewhat animal here?
We're in the middle of the woods.

150
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Hey, don't you fucking get it? I've told you, don't touch him.

151
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Or do you want to be the killer?

152
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,920
But when we lifted his motorbike, our fingerprints were already left there.

153
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Don't worry about it.
We'll tell them that you guys had good intention.

154
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Tee.

155
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Hey.

156
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Look.

157
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,760
Why don't you guys find something to cover his body?
His corpse is fucking scary.

158
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Okay, got it.

159
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Shoo! Go away!

160
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
We're so sorry, Uncle.

161
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

162
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:51,360
Actually, you didn't wanna come, but I kept asking you to come.
And now, we're in a dangerous place.

163
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:06,720
Just forget it. When you asked me, you didn't know
that things like this were gonna happen.

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Now shit happened. We just gotta get through it.

166
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
You know I'm a fighter. And I’m always aware of things.

167
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Should we try to reach Top and Tan to see where they are now?

168
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Of course.

169
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
1 to 2. Top, can you hear me? Over.

170
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Tan, can you hear me? Copy? Over.

171
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Can't reach them. I guess they're out of range now.

172
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
Maybe, they're closer to the way out now.

173
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
That's good. They probably can get someone to save all of us.

174
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,520
It looks like there are no houses here.
Are we in the right direction?

175
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
I think it's the right direction...or is it not?

176
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,320
What? How would I know that.
I followed the route you told me.

177
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
Hey, hey, hey!

178
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Ahhhhhhh!

179
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Top, do you copy?

180
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Top, do you copy?

181
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,800
It's not working. What should we do?

182
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,160
We gotta help them.

183
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,560
White, you don't have to go. Stay here.

184
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,560
No, Tee. Let's go altogether.
I don't want to be alone and go nuts.

185
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,040
White, I think you should stay with Fluke to look after Por.

186
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,240
Jin, Tee, you two, come with me.

187
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Show-off.

188
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Help me! Top! Top's gone...

189
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Phee, Phee, Jin!

190
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Phee, Phee, Jin!

191
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Hey, shit!

192
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Help me!

193
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,960
What hit you?

194
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
The motorbike fell...next thing Tan knew was Top was already gone?

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,319
Tell me exactly what happened.

196
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Before the motorbike fell,
Top was scared of something so he pulled off the direction.

197
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
When I got up, he was nowhere to be found.

198
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
So I walked back to you guys first.

199
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Or could Top be the next one?

200
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,080
Shit, I've told you it's cursed. He won't stop easily.

201
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,520
And now, he's doing it again.

202
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,240
That's on you, Phee. You let him go.

203
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
What? How did that have to do with me? Top volunteered.

204
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Or could it be that that dumbass Top sneak out alone?

205
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Because a guy like Top wouldn't miss a chance to get away.

206
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,240
He must have been waiting for the right timing, I think.

207
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I don't think so.

208
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
If he really wanted to do that, he wouldn't have to let himself get hurt.

209
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,800
And what about the motorbike? Is it gone too?

210
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
I didn't see both Top and the motorbike.

211
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,760
If Tan hurts this much, how injured is Top going to be?

212
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Then, I think we must do something.

213
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
Oh, shit.

214
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,520
Are we almost there?
We're in the right direction, aren't we?

215
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
If we get off this spot, we're there.

216
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,880
It's right here.

217
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Around here.

218
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
Hey, Tan, look.

219
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,440
Is this where you guys fell?

220
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Yeah, Top pulled out of the way, and we fell here.

221
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
From the tire print...

222
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
It's going that way.

223
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,280
So did Top really run away?

224
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,400
And left us all here?

225
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,880
But he didn't have to crash the motorbike, did he?

226
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Look at his size, he could kick Tan off the road.
And one more thing, he's a coward.

227
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
He wouldn't dare run away alone in the woods like this.

228
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,160
Then, we should follow.

229
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,160
So we'd know if he really ran away,
or was it a setup of the ninth person.

230
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Is it early morning or late night? I can't even tell.

231
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I heard the thunder. Seems like it's about to rain.

232
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Sadhu. I hope it's not gonna rain. We'll be in more trouble.

233
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Look.

234
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Or is this the legendary dwelling of Janta?

235
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,440
It looks like it's about to rain, Fluke.
Won't it be more difficult for us?

236
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
That time...

237
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Por, what is it? Can you hear me?

238
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I shouldn't have...taken his money...

239
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Fluke, what did Por say?
Can you help me listen to him?

240
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Move over.

241
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Nothing, Por must be murmuring.
Sick people do that.

242
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
You were there too, Fluke.

243
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,120
Por, what is it?

244
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,040
Por, Por, can you hear me, Por?

245
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,000
Por!

246
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,960
The day Non...disappeared...

247
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,600
Por!

248
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,040
Ahhhhh!

249
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,880
Por!

250
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,440
Por!

251
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,440
Hey, Fluke, that's too harsh.
He'll bleed to death.

252
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,560
What was he saying earlier?
What was Por trying to say?

253
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I couldn't catch it either.

254
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,960
But I think you should...go somewhere else first.

255
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,280
I'll clean the wound. And, you don't have to see something nasty.

256
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Are you sure?

257
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,400
Yeah, just go already!

258
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
What are you doing?

259
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,360
Nothing. I'm just thinking whether I should stay and help you.

260
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,080
I said no. Didn't you hear that?

261
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,000
Just go take a shower and then we'll switch.

262
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Hurry up and come back.
Don't fall asleep anywhere.

263
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Sorry for intrusion. But for your life's sake, I have to look.

264
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Shit, it's broken.

265
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,720
Fuck, it's blood.

266
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Fuck!

267
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,400
This is Top's wallet chain.

268
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
Must be his blood.

269
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He must be badly injured. I was riding with him and look at how bad I am.
He's the rider. I don't know if he's alive.

270
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,960
If this really is Top's blood, if he bleeds this much, how can he walk?

271
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I think if he does walk, he won't be far.

272
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,640
The engine won't start.

273
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,520
The rider is gone.

274
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Or is he trying to escape from something?

275
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
What makes Top like this?

276
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I don't know. But I think he must be inside.

277
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
He's hurt and on foot. He can't be far away.

278
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Shit.

279
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Shit, where could he go?

280
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Hey, calm down.

281
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Top!

282
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
What the hell is this?

283
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,200
This is the cult that Por said.

284
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
This is for real, man. This is the real deal here.

285
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Or the one who took Top was really the ghost from the legend?

286
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I don't know. Whether it's a human or a ghost,
we must find Top and bring him home.

287
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
That's easy to say, but what can we do?
We don't know where Top went.

288
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
The fastest way to find him is to split up.

289
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,360
If we do that, it will be exactly like in a horror movie.

290
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,520
I agree with Phee. It's too dangerous if we split up.

291
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,520
So do I. We'll stay alive together, we'll die if we separate.

292
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,040
It's really dark out there, and I don't know what's inside.

293
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,040
I know that everyone's scared now,
but it's Top's life we're talking about.

294
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,840
The sooner we find him, the better, right?

295
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,840
But if another one of us disappears, we'll be fucked.

296
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
You know you have asthma, yet you still smoke.

297
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,760
I'm smoking because I'm scared.
If I don't smoke, I can't control myself.

298
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,960
What's that smell?

299
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
...No.

300
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Dust...

301
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
What's that box?

302
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,120
This is...

303
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,360
Ahhhhh!

304
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Por!

305
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Por!

306
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,720
This is fresh blood.

307
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,880
Or Non sold his soul to the devil and gave his life for sacrifice?

308
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
Leave Non out of this for once.
We're looking for Top. Focus!

309
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,600
Hey, Tee!

310
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
You guys, move!

311
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Damn.

312
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Shit...is that...

313
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Shit.

314
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
Is this Non?

315
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
What are you doing?

316
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I think he's gone.

317
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
Fucking scary.
It's like in the movie, but we could die for real.

318
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

319
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,239
This is frustrating. Let's get out of here.

320
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,760
Are you kidding me?

321
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm not. It's for real.
I think when the masked man touched it, it fell into the slit.

322
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Did you open the file?

323
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Yes, I just wanted to check if it still worked.

324
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
And what did you see?

325
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Nothing. It's just a video of you guys getting drunk and partying.

326
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
That's right.

327
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,320
There's nothing. Why would you wanna watch it that much?

328
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,280
If you're free, go downstairs and give me a hand.

329
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I think I'm gonna re-sew Por's wound.

330
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Okay.

331
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,360
Wait.

332
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,320
What?

333
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
And how about Phee and Jin?
You're not gonna wait for them?

334
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,320
You should survive first before helping others.

335
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
Shit, but Phee and Jin are inside.

336
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Shit!

337
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Tee!

338
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Let me go.

339
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Tee, where are you?
I played the video in the hard disk earlier.

340
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Fluke walked in and saw.
Tee, come home, hurry. Fluke is really scary.

341
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Shit!

342
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Fuck!

343
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,080
Damn in, where is he going?

344
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Shit.

345
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Fuck!

346
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,760
White said that he'd already played the video earlier.

347
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,880
And Fluke's acting weird.

348
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,720
Why would White play the video for?

349
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,840
We've talked about this that we won't play it. It's cursed.

350
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:12,840
And the masked murderer might go straight to the one who played it.

351
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Fuck.

352
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,680
He might go back and kill Phee and Jin.
We should help them first.

353
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,680
No, I'll go home and help my partner.

354
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Por's dying. Fluke won't be able to fight.

355
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,800
We must go back and help Phee, Jin and Top.

356
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Forget it. My partner is in danger. I must go help him.

357
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Tee, wait for me.

358
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Por! Por! Por!

359
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Fluke! Fluke! Come see Por now!

360
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,520
Por looks like he's having a seizure.

361
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Move.

362
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
White, I told you to help me find the tools to sew Por's wound, didn't I?

363
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,880
And what are you waiting for? Get over here!

364
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,480
What are you going to sew his wound with, Fluke?

365
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,440
Whatever that I can use.

366
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Just help me look for the tools.

367
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Is that okay?
Normally, it has to be clean needle and thread.

368
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
You, dumbass White,
I asked you to help me find stuff not arguing with me!

369
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Even I didn't study medicine,
but you gotta do fucking whatever you can.

370
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,840
But if you won't do shit,
just let Por die already, you piece of shit!

371
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Damn it!

372
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
Get over here!

373
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,080
White, how long have you had the gun?
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,400
You have this useful stuff and you didn't tell me about it?

375
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Shit, or are you the murderer?

376
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
No.

377
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,720
I guess, the masked murderer could be home now.

378
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,040
Shit, Tee, calm down.

379
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Fuck, how should I warn White?

380
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I don't understand why you all didn't want us see the video.

381
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,320
Who would want to see the video of a friend disappearing?

382
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,040
Hello, White! Hello, White!
Can you hear me?

383
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Hello, Tee.

384
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,960
White, listen. Right now, the murderer is heading home.

385
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,640
If you're not too far away, we can still communicate.

386
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Everyone would feel better.

387
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
C'mon.

388
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
C'mon.

389
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,840
Oh, Tan...

390
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Shit.

391
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
I think I should push it.

392
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
Alright, let's do it.

393
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,560
Back off.

394
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
One, two, three.

395
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Go!

396
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
That's scary.

397
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Shit, you just leave me?

398
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
And action!

399
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
C'mon, Tan, we're almost there.

400
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
One...Two...

401
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Let's do it again.

402
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
One...Two...

403
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Again.

404
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Should we start?

405
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,720
Yeah, let's try.

406
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Accelerate.

407
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,800
Right.

408
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
More, more.

409
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Yeah, Tan. I can do it. Let's go.

410
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
A bit more.

411
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Right around here.

412
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Tan, look.

413
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Was this where you fell?

414
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,280
Yeah, Fluke pulled off and we fell here.

415
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,080
Fluke?

416
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
Oops!

417
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Top!

418
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
Top, Top, Top, Top!

419
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Is it early morning or is it late night? I can't tell.

420
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,080
I heard a thunder. Looks like it's about to rain.

421
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Shit!

422
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Shit!

423
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Shit!

424
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,400
There's so much blood, if it were a man,
he probably dead be...ooh, sorry.

425
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Sorry, tongue twister...

426
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,800
Hey, Tee!

427
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
I slipped.

428
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,080
Cut, cut. Let's do it again.

429
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Hold my hand.

430
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,160
You're dead if you hold it like this.

431
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
Right into your hand.

432
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
This is frustrating. Let's get out of here.

433
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,320
Are you kidding me?

434
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,800
I'm not. It's for real.

435
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,800
I think when the masked man touched it, it fell into the slit.

436
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,800
Is this Non?

437
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,120
Guys, bottoms up!

438
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,960
Bottoms up!

439
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Bottoms up! Up! Up!

440
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
Alright, bottoms up for the second time!

441
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,760
Cheers!

442
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,760
Yeah, done. Amazing!

443
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,920
You drank the whole thing?

444
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,400
Yeah, I haven't had soda in so long.
