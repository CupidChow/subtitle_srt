2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,240
I can't be your friend with benefit anymore.

3
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,640
Can we be a couple?

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,320
So did your friends know where you got the money?

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
No, I didn't want you to get into trouble.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,760
Fluke, yesterday, I didn't...

7
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,800
Hey, what the hell, Jin? What are you talking about?

8
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,760
Why did you fuck my partner?

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,120
Can you forgive me?

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,120
You want me to forgive you? Just get lost and die.

11
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Uncle.

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,520
How did he get the money...your friend? Where did he get it?

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
I don't know that too.

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Is there something wrong, Uncle?

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,680
Your friend...seems to be a problem.

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,320
He got away from the case without any cause,
and he also managed to pay me hundred thousands of Baht.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,920
It couldn't be anything else.

18
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,440
Your friend is the police's spy.

19
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,400
Impossible. I've already asked him. He said he's not.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,640
You're stupid, Tee.

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
You know it. Now, the police and the news reporters are digging into my story.

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
How many accounts did I have to close? That's all on your friend.

23
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,680
Hey, Ton!

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,800
Yes, Boss.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,079
Take care of him.

26
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't let him talk about my business with anyone else.

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,440
Are you sure this is the place?
It looks like a normal street restaurant.

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Yes, this is the place. Our lead says this is Big Joe's illegal casino.

30
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
This street restaurant is just a cover-up.

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
Oh, okay, I'll try to get inside.

32
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Be careful.

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I will.

34
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
Er...may I use the restroom, please?

35
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,040
The restroom is off limits here.
If you wanna eat something, order.

36
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Alright.

37
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
I've found the casino entrance.

38
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,920
But I couldn't get in. I think they knew.

39
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
Then, get out of there quickly.

40
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,120
Hey!

41
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Now, wherever I go, people keep talking about our son.

42
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,280
At work, my collegues gossip amusingly. I can't work there anymore.

43
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,320
That's because of you.

44
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,080
You spoiled him. That's why he became like this.

45
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,160
How could you blame it on me? Huh?
That's because of you. You don't love our sons equally.

46
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,920
You only care about New. Do you even care about Non?

47
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:14,960
New's a good kid, unlike Non.
He can't do anything well like New.

48
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,960
And look now, Non has embarrassed us.

49
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Why can't you just protect Non?

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What kind of a mother are you?
You've never tried to understand our son's feelings at all.

51
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,480
Don't say that I'm a bad mother.

52
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,480
You always say you gotta work.
Have you ever helped me raise our children?

53
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,960
You never understand how tiring it is to raise our kids like this.

54
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
I went out to work to find money for you to raise our kids.
Why are you complaining?

55
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,560
It's all because of you. That's why Non became like this.

56
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,400
It's all because of you! You're a shitty father.

57
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Pimpa!

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,159
You're not the best mother in the world.

59
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,200
You always compare our sons.

60
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
If you want to go see New abroad, go!

61
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,720
And leave Non with me, if you don't want to raise him.

62
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,720
I've never said that kind of thing!

63
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,720
But has New ever done anything?
And how about your son, Non?

64
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
He's your son too!

65
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
If you want to go see New, then go. If you can't stay, leave.

66
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Is this...your doing?

67
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,600
Non: Mr. Keng, about the leaked video,
could you see from the school's CCTVs who recorded it?

68
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Non: I'll come over.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
Non...Non...

70
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,640
Non, where are you going?

71
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,600
That's my business.

72
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Non, how could you say that to her?

73
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,240
Move.

74
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Ouch!

75
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Non! Apologize to her, right now!

76
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:06,120
You want me to apologize? Alright. I will apologize.

77
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,600
I apologize for being a bad kid, a fraud and having sex with a man.

78
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I disappoint you in every way. I'm sorry that I can't be like New.

79
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
Non. Non. Let me go!

80
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
Non! Non!

81
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
No one can help me!

82
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
You shitty Greasy, give me the camera.

83
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I forgot to have Uncle Dang bring the food for us.
Can you ride down the hill and get us the food?

84
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Why didn't you wait for me when you started shooting?

85
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,160
It's a wrap!

86
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
We'll continue tomorrow.

87
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Fuckers.

88
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
It's too scandalous. A tutor having sex with a student under 18.

89
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
But from the video, that kid is quite something.

90
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
It's the mutual consent.

91
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I thought he was chaste. But he was very horny.

92
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Fine.

93
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,320
And suddenly,

94
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,680
the murderer appeared under the black cloak, like a huge shadowy figure, chasing his prey into the woods,

95
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,000
disorienting the prey and leading him to the trap.

96
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,320
The sharp stick of the trap pierced the stomach, blood dripping everywhere.

97
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,640
The prey cried in agony like a butchered animal.

98
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,600
The murderer slashed his axe on the restroom door.

99
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:47,840
He slashed the axe at the neck, cutting the artery.

100
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,280
Blood spilled all over the place.

101
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,240
Lastly, no one survives.

102
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:06,600
No one could leave this abandoned house, not even one.

103
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,600
This revenge was complete. Everyone died in suffering.

104
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,680
I must ask you to slow down with this case a bit.

105
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,480
And I'll transfer the money for wasting your time.

106
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,840
Of course, sir. If you need it right away, I'll do it now.

107
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Thank you very much. Thank you.

108
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,640
This is getting out of control.

109
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,640
The high-ranking police whom I'm close to don't know how long he can stall the case.

110
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Another police team wants to take this case.

111
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,920
And how are you going to handle this?

112
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,920
I gotta destroy the witnesses, especially, those foul-mouths.

113
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
And that spy kid, he's going to make the situation worse.

114
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Tee, I order you to take care of him now.

115
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Uncle, are you saying that I have to kill Non?

116
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,040
That's what I thought. You're a coward.

117
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,040
How about this? Bring him to me.

118
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,360
If I bring him here, you won't kill him, will you?

119
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,280
Please don't kill him.

120
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I just want to teach him a lesson and find a way to shut his mouth.

121
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I'm being merciful because of you, Tee.

122
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
This leaked video is worse than we thought.

123
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,079
At first, I thought it wouldn't affect us that much.

124
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,359
But today, the sponsor told me that netizens cursed him.

125
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,440
They digged into the story and found out that
Greasy also got the sponsorship from him.

126
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,920
If they wanted to curse, they could only just curse Greasy.
Why would they lead to us?

127
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,200
But we got the budget. No matter what, we have to finish it.

128
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Yes, the sponsor said he wouldn't take the money back,
but we needed to finish the movie in time.

129
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,360
And now, we have less and less time.
We haven't accomplished much.

130
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Do you think we'll finish the movie in time, Jin?

131
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Jin!

132
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Huh? What?

133
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
What's wrong with you?

134
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Nothing, I'm just sleepy. I played the game too late last night.

135
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,880
The less time we have, the more people we need.

136
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,800
I think no matter what, we still need Greasy to come back and help us.

137
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,760
I don't think that's a good idea. Non just had a hard time.

138
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
He won't be able to help us much.

139
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
You guys are weird.

140
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Tee, normally, you hate Greasy so much, don't you?

141
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,280
But this short movie, it's more urgent.
I can decrease my hatred.

142
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Alright, we can keep Greasy until we finish the movie.

143
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
But I won't give him any credit, so the netizens won't scold us.

144
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Jin!

145
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,280
You go talk to Greasy. You're close to him the most.

146
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,000
Fuck. That's a long time. We're here!

147
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,280
Yeah, that was tiring.

148
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
Make room for me.

149
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Hey, Greasy, why are you standing there?
Get here and sit down.

150
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,440
When we shoot, we won't be able to sit for a long time.

151
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,320
Go, sit down.

152
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,200
What are you looking at, Greasy?

153
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
And you too, why are you looking at me? Move!

154
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,680
Your lips are dry. Here, have some water.

155
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,160
Huh?

156
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Go ahead. Drink some water. Your lips are chapped.

157
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,080
Okay?

158
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Thanks.

159
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Well, I got a new script. Just fixed it. Could you have a look?

160
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,520
A new script?

161
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
Yes.

162
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
The old one isn't exciting. This one has more exciting hunting scenes.

163
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,400
You can't just change the script like this,
or else we won't make it in time.

164
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,320
Have you read what Greasy fixed? Try reading it first.

165
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,320
If it's not good, don't change it.
But if it's good, we can change it now.

166
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Alright, give it to me.

167
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,240
What? Greasy, how did you manage to have this golden script?

168
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,160
This is fucking gold! Shit, it's awesome!

169
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,880
Jin, wanna read it?

170
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,880
No, I'll let you decide, Por.

171
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,280
If you ask me, I'll take it.

172
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,200
But the effect team will have to work hard.

173
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Effect team? That's me, me, and me.

174
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
Can we not do it too much? It's a hard work.

175
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Why are you complaining? It's a waste of time.

176
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
Shall we start then?

177
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,440
Sure.

178
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,640
Let's go.

179
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Yeah, let's.

180
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,560
Here, your prop.

181
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,560
When you act, make sure the sharp tip doesn't hit Top.

182
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Understood?

183
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,760
Greasy!

184
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Take it! Hey!

185
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,520
Alright, I'll be careful.

186
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,480
Hey, guys, are you done with the camera?

187
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,400
Yes.

188
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
That's good. Let's rehearse.

189
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,280
Alright, alright.

190
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Okay.

191
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,880
Ready?

192
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,360
Ready.

193
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,080
Three, two, one.

194
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,280
Hey, I've found the map.

195
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,280
The Mask! How did you get here. I'm scared, I'm scared.

196
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Good, good, good. That's great.

197
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
And, action!

198
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
Hey, guys, I've found the map.

199
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Come check it. Here.

200
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,640
Where is it? Here, right now we are here.

201
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
If we follow this route,

202
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,840
just keep following the route,

203
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,320
until we reach here, we'll be there.

204
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,960
Let's go then. Go.

205
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,800
The Mask!

206
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
How did you get here?

207
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Hey, hey, don't do that.

208
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
Hey!

209
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Top, watch out!

210
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,320
Run, you idiots, go!

211
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,240
Go!

212
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Shit.

213
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,240
Shit. He's coming.

214
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Go!

215
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,680
Just fucking go down quickly.

216
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Fuck! Hurry!

217
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,280
Top, open the door.

218
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Hey, help me here.

219
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Fuck!

220
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,280
You guys are shameless!

221
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
You asked me to work here.

222
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,240
You took advantage of me.

223
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,240
You tortured me. Bullied me.

224
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,720
And you stole my work.

225
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Now, I don't have anything left.

226
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
Non, take it easy. Put down the knife, so we can tal..

227
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Easy, my ass. Tee, YOU TOO!

228
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,560
You took me to open the horse account.

229
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,560
You used me. I almost went to jail. Fucking shit!

230
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Know this. The reason I asked you
to open the account was because of him.

231
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,480
What did you say?

232
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,880
I know that you're stressed so you say something unreal.

233
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
I think we should reconcile. Sounds good?

234
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Liar. Liar. You, liar!

235
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,000
Hey!

236
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Top.

237
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Top.

238
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,040
Tee.

239
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Non.

240
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,880
All this time, we've done terrible things to you.

241
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Now, I know how it's affected you.

242
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I'm sorry.

243
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,600
You're not the one to say sorry, Jin.

244
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm the one who should apologize to you the most.

245
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,960
Non, I'm sorry.

246
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Sorry.

247
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,240
Sor...sor...sor...

248
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Shit.

249
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,440
Hey, Por, Stop!

250
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,600
Why the fuck should I stop!

251
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,280
What if he wakes up and tries to kill us?

252
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Just calm down!

253
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,000
Calm down.

254
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'll take it from here.

255
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Have the set ready and continue shooting.

256
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,880
Wait, wait, wait. Tell me where you're taking Non.

257
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,400
It's fine. He'll live. He just passed out.

258
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'll help him sort his debt.
Don't you want to help him?

259
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Top, com help me. Fuck, he's heavy.

260
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Fuck it.

261
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,600
Lift him up.

262
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Fuck, my arm hurts.

263
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Are we gonna let him do that?

264
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,520
If you want stop him, go ahead.

265
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,520
Tee said he wanted to help. I trusted him.

266
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I have no part in this anyway.

267
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Non's parents said that he went to shoot the short movie
with his friends and then vanished.

268
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Did Non join you to shoot the movie?

269
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Non...didn't go to shoot the movie with us.

270
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,080
You can see that Non isn't in the video.

271
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,080
I have the footage of the shooting day as the evidence.

272
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,600
The reason we didn't ask Non to come was because of the leaked video.

273
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,600
We even considered removing him from the team.

274
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,160
We think Non just ran away with Mr. Keng.

275
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,240
They both disappeared.

276
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Your friends said you're close to Non the most.

277
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,600
Yes.

278
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,600
What is the possibility that Non ran away with Mr. Keng?

279
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,800
They seemed to truly love each other.

280
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,720
I think there's a high possibility.

281
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
According to the news in the social media

282
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,000
about the leaked video between the tutor and the student,

283
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,360
the boy's family called the police

284
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,880
because the boy has mysteriously vanished.

285
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,680
No one has been unable to contact him for one week.

286
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,880
Because the other person in the leaked video
also vanished in the same period,

287
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,840
we still have to keep the assumption that these two are together.

288
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,000
What is the possibility that the said people are still alive?

289
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Please excuse me on this. Everything is in the case file.

290
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,080
They're trying to make our son look like he ran away with a man.

291
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,880
What a lousy summary.

292
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,280
What are we going to do?

293
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,280
We need more money. And we need to hire a better lawyer.

294
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,600
And we need to bribe to accelerate the process.

295
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

296
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,920
But first, we need to know where Non is.

297
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Cut!

298
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
That's a wrap.

299
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
All's done.

300
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,080
Fluke, you shouldn't study Medicine.

301
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:25,680
Why is that?

302
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
You should study Film Editing. Your effect is great.

303
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,120
Yeah.

304
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
What?

305
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
All set.

306
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Finally.

307
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Por, do we have to carry this camara?
Or will your people carry it for us?

308
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,320
I think I'll leave it here.

309
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,440
Wha-? And don't you have to use it again?

310
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,440
In case of reshoot, we don't have to carry it back and forth.

311
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Oh, yeah, right. That makes sense.

312
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,720
Damn.

313
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
Here, guys. Before Uncle Dang picks us up.

314
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,800
For celebrating shooting wrap.

315
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,280
Here. Take one each. And let's post it on Story.

316
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,199
There's no reception, isn't it?

317
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:25,960
Wha-? You just post it you have the reception. What a killjoy.

318
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,280
Come, come, come, come.

319
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Jin, there's one for you. Come here.

320
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,719
Non should have been celebrating the shooting wrap with us.

321
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,560
Jin. Didn't we talk that we wouldn't mention Greasy again.

322
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,159
Can I ask one thing from you?

323
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Can you call Non Non, just once?

324
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Jin. Move on. Now Non is with Mr, Keng.

325
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,480
I think he's happy.

326
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Here, take this.

327
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Move, Fluke.

328
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,480
Want some music?

329
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,080
You play it.

330
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,720
Alright, I'll choose the song.

331
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Come.

332
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,320
Come. Let's clink the cans.

333
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Come. Bottom's up!

334
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Jin.

335
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,360
Come on. Hurry, Jin.

336
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Yeah.

337
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,760
Uncle Joe, do you want to talk to me?

338
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,720
I just talked with the police commissioner.

339
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
He suggests that investigation should focus on Mr. Keng.

340
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,880
They checked the account and found that
he'd transferred 300,000 Baht to the boy.

341
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,880
And they both disappeared.

342
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,280
So, we're no longer under police surveillance?

343
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,800
Correct.

344
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,920
See. My solution always works.

345
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,920
As a reward for bringing that kid to me,

346
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,680
here's 20,000 Baht for your pleasure.

347
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Uncle, can I ask you something?

348
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
What?

349
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
What happened to Non after I'd brought him to you?

350
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Like I told you. I had him work for his debt.
When things calmed down, I sent him away.

351
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,560
You didn't kill him along with Mr. Keng, did you?

352
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,240
What's wrong with you? You brought your friend to me.
And now you have a problem with me?

353
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Take the money and leave before I'm upset even more.

354
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
The watch I borrowed from a friend, it's nice.

355
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,480
Can I ask you something?

356
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,520
Do you know where Non and Mr. Keng are?

357
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
I don't know.

358
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,000
Are they still alive?

359
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I don't know.

360
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
You can't even tell if they're dead or alive?

361
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Don't ask many questions.

362
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Hey, Dad.

363
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
What's wrong?

364
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,320
My boss told me to drop the horse account case.

365
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
But you're the inspector, aren't you?

366
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,000
Yes.

367
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But what about my commander?

368
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
There's nothing I can do.

369
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,680
And...you're just gonna give up like this?

370
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,360
You give up while the bad guy is still out there?

371
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,920
This case is harder and bigger than we thought, Phee.

372
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,920
There're many other businessmen involved in this business.

373
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,160
These businessmen sent a threat letter to kill me.

374
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Including killing you too.

375
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,080
If I didn't have you, I'd press on.

376
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
But I promised your mother.

377
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
That's why I stepped back.

378
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,120
What about Non and Mr. Keng, who disappeared?

379
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,120
The ones people say the ran away together?

380
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:59,120
The ones people say the ran away together?
Judging from the size of this case, these two are forced to disappear.

381
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
Forced to disappear?

382
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
What does it mean, Dad?

383
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
It means you must prepare for the worst thing possible to happen.

384
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,160
I know that you've been through a really hard time.

385
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
But from now on, there will be no more...

386
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Can we be a couple?

387
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Come with me.

388
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,800
I know that you have good intentions.

389
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,760
But let me take some time to think about it.

390
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,840
Phee, you may think it's not important.

391
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,840
But for me, it's what I want to do.

392
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,840
Non, you gotta promise me that

393
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,760
from now on, you won't lie to me.

394
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,840
I promise. I will never lie to you.

395
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,400
You two really aren't a thing?

396
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
No, we're not a thing.

397
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
You want me to forgive you?

398
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Just get lost and die.

399
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,880
Hey, where did Por go?

400
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,320
Yeah, where is he?

401
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,440
He should be the first one here.

402
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,440
He hasn't done with his make-up, believe me.

403
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
There he is.

404
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Whoa. He acts like it's only for him.

405
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Do you understand how Non felt?

406
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,960
Don't overthink about it.

407
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Without Por's parents, our movie wouldn't be here.

408
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Just give whatever spotlight he wants.

409
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,840
The Mask. Fuck!

410
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
Top.

411
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
The Mask.

412
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,160
Hey, hey, hey. That's me.

413
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
Why do you have to be loud?

414
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
Hey, don't do it!

415
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,120
Run, you idiots, go!

416
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,840
Go, go! Damn it.

417
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
Fuck!

418
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Hurry.

419
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,200
The movie is fucking great.

420
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,800
Especially, my scenes. Everyone screamed.

421
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,080
Maybe they screamed because of my handsomeness.

422
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,400
They screamed because of the ghost, not you.

423
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,400
What a fucking killjoy. I'll give you a smack.

424
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,240
But I heard the scream.

425
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,760
They screamed because they feared
when Top was making his handsome face.

426
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,960
Hey, stop teasing me.

427
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,800
Yeah, whatever. But I think it's on the right spot.

428
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,760
I heard many people say "Good movie, good script."

429
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,280
I think when we play this in the short film festival, we'll be the finalist.

430
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,280
Good job, son.

431
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,280
I can't believe that you're both the screenwriter and director of this movie.

432
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,240
Good work. This is what the son of Representative Ekkachai should be.

433
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
My help in this is not in vein.

434
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,760
Please support my son's first short moive.

435
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,760
I guarantee that it's fun and exciting.

436
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Phee.

437
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,880
Today I have an annoucement to make.

438
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,760
We have 2 new students.

439
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,760
New students. In 12th grade?

440
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,520
Hello.

441
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,120
My name's Phee.

442
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,920
Hello. I'm Tan.

443
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,360
Are you the ones who made the short movie, Janta?

444
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,880
The plot is phenomenal.

445
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,840
Who wrote the script?
