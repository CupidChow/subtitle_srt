2
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Your job is to transfer money to the accounts that I send you every day.

3
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
Once the money reaches the clients' accounts, your job's done.

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
If we open bank accounts for each team, it may be a good idea.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,200
Because we'll be able to transfer the money for each team's expenses separately.

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
Fuck.

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,160
Greasy just transfered the money for the camera.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
We got a warning about having our bank accounts checked.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
That account, my friend told me to open it.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,200
We're fooled by Non.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Non, Non.

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,440
What are you doing?

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Nothing. I'm just bored.

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,080
Do you wanna meet up?

16
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Are you Non?

17
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Yes.

18
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Phee.

19
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,079
Eat something first.

20
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,520
If we wait until dark, we will see the Milky Way.

21
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
I think we can see elephant way.

22
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Elephant way.

23
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,959
Non.

24
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,440
I can't be your friend with benefit anymore.

25
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Hmm?

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can we be a couple?

27
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,560
You take so long. I'll answer it for you.

28
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,760
I know that you've been through really hard times.

29
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
But from now on, there will be no more...

30
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Put that on for me too.

31
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,520
Non: "I'm afraid, Phee. What if I got arrested?"

32
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
What is it, Phee?

33
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wanna eat something?

34
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I'd like you to help me with something important.

35
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
What is it?

36
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,600
If you don't help me, I'll be in trouble.

37
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Phee, go straight to the point. What have you done?

38
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,280
Ooh, he here comes.

39
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,720
Sir, let us have an interview.

40
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Now we have the result of the initial investigation.

41
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
That kid isn't a part of the grey horse accounts.

42
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
He's just a victim.

43
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,200
Sir, the Member of the House of Representative, Ekkachai,
blamed that kid to be the bad guy.

44
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
And damaged his son's reputation.

45
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,000
Then how will the result affect Mr. Ekkachai?

46
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
That's true. How wil it turn out?

47
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,800
Right now, the result hasn't come to a conclusion.

48
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,320
I'd like everyone to trust the police.

49
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,280
We are searching for the big boss as soon as we can.

50
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
And is there any other information?

51
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Right now, that's all I had to say.

52
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Excuse me.

53
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,159
Phee, what did you tell your Dad?

54
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I told him that I was a part in it with you too.

55
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,560
If he didn't help me, I would also be the bad guy.

56
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,760
And why did you lie to your Dad like that?

57
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Because I wanted to help you.

58
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
But don't worry. There aren't any problems I cannot fix.

59
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Can I ask you for one thing, Non?

60
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
Move to another school.

61
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
So we can be together.

62
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Studying at that school won't make things better.

63
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Those friends who call you Greasy, friends don't do that, Non.

64
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Come with me.

65
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,240
I know that you have good intentions.

66
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
But let me take some time to think about it.

67
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,200
How did you manage to make the cop say that?

68
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,200
You confessed and how could you become just a victim?
Are you the cop's spy?

69
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,080
No, I'm not their spy.

70
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
I just asked for help.

71
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,680
Don't you think of causing more troubles, Greasy.

72
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,680
You did it to yourself. This doesn't involve me.

73
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not saying anything.

74
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,560
You asked someone to help you about the case,
why didn't you ask him to help you with Boss Joe's money?

75
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Just pay him what you owed him, so we're done.

76
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm trying to do that right now. Can't I have more time?

77
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,040
Don't take too long.
And don't make it a big mess and cause me trouble.

78
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I'm warning you, Greasy. Boss is not a calm person.

79
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
Here comes the troublemaker.

80
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
You broke my camera. We almost couldn't shoot a movie.

81
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
And you caused me more troubles again and again.

82
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Or do you want him out of our short film project?

83
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,240
Because your parents said...

84
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
you should stay away from that Greasy.

85
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,520
How could you do that?

86
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,960
Non wrote the screenplay.
He helped you all with the scenes.

87
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,240
And one more thing, the police said that he wasn't involved.

88
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,240
But you do know that he's actually a fruad.

89
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,120
And now, you're trying to defend him?

90
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,360
But Non wrote the screenplay.

91
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,360
And, we couldn't write it nicely.
If you cut him off right now, won't it be more messed up?

92
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Alright, we'll keep Greasy until we finish shooting.

93
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,120
But let me tell you this, a fruad like him,
I won't let him get away easily.

94
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Non.

95
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
Jin.

96
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Don't overthink.
They're just angry. Give them some time.

97
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Jin, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

98
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Hey, that's alright.

99
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,720
You've cleared your name.

100
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,400
And it didn't cause anyone troubles.

101
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,520
Por's parents just made it big like they always do.

102
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,520
When the film's shown, this thing will go away.

103
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,640
We'll see each other at the set, alright?

104
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I think they'll set the date in the Line group chat.

105
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,720
Why do you still have to work at the set witht them?

106
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,600
I really don't like that you're close to those people.

107
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Are they really your friends?

108
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I told Por and the others that I will finish this movie.

109
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't want to be an irresposible person.

110
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
But it's just a short film for the contest.
Why do you have to be so serious about it?

111
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
Phee, you may think it's not important.

112
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,280
But for me, it's what I want to do.

113
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Okay.

114
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
And Non, do you have anything else that you haven't told me about?

115
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
No.

116
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Nothing else? Or do you not want to tell me?

117
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,680
If you don't believe me, why do you ask me?

118
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Because I do know that there's something else.

119
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,920
Well, I'm worried about you, Non.

120
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I know. Just let me finish this film and I'll stop messing with those people.

121
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Can I just manage all problems by myself first?

122
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Okay.

123
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
But on one condition...

124
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,520
What's that?

125
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,320
Non, you gotta promise me that from now on, you won't lie to me.

126
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I promise. I will never lie to you.

127
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
How many pages?

128
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I'll open the door for Non.

129
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
How did you get here?

130
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,320
I had the villager downhill bring me here.

131
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,080
What?

132
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,320
C'mon in first. We've been waiting.

133
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,160
Oh, okay.

134
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,160
C'mon.

135
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,720
Guys, I'm sorry. I woke up a little late this morning.

136
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,920
Hey, Greasy, don't go change yet.

137
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,640
Huh?

138
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,680
I forgot to have Uncle Dang deliver us the meal.

139
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,000
Can you ride down the hill and get it?

140
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,120
You know how to ride, right?

141
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Por.

142
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Uncle Dang's motorbike is parked in front of the house.
We'll rehearse in the meantime

143
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,960
...while you're out.

144
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
You don't want Non to stay with the rehearsal?

145
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,720
He's the writer, so everyone won't mess up.

146
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
This is reshooting. It's the same as before.
He doesn't need to stay.

147
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
It's alright.

148
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Er...it's alright. I was late too.

149
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll go get some food for you all.
Be right back.

150
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,560
Let's go. Let's shoot.

151
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,600
Why the hell are you still sitting? Such a waste of time.

152
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,280
C'mon.

153
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,880
Let's go.

154
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,040
What? You said you would wait for Greasy...

155
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,240
That's true. The scene we're about to shoot, there's Non's part too.

156
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
How are we gonna shoot if he's not here.

157
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
Just cut him out.

158
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,200
I will never let his face appear in my movie.

159
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Go, move your asses. Let's get the shooting started.

160
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Now.

161
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Fluke.

162
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Guys, why didn't anyone open the d...oor?

163
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,319
Where have they gone to?

164
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,560
Hey, this shot is so good.

165
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,280
Let me see.

166
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,800
See? Look at Top's funny face. It's priceless.

167
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
That's hilarious.

168
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Handsomeness!

169
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,280
That's awesome.

170
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,400
Hey, why didn't you all wait for me?

171
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,320
I went to get you your food.

172
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Well, you're too slow.
And there's no phone signal here. We couldn't call you.

173
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
If I had to wait for you, wouldn't the sun go down first?

174
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,280
And one more thing, other people got a few things to do.

175
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,240
And what do you do?

176
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
You're just a writer. Isn't that too much of an advantage?

177
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,800
What the hell did you buy?

178
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I...I just...

179
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Just...

180
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,280
Just...

181
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,960
I...

182
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,880
There's fucking nothing!

183
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
And you're still complaining?

184
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,600
It's a wrap!

185
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
Hey!

186
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm tired. We'll continue tomorrow.

187
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,760
Top, the food.

188
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,760
Yeah, go for it.

189
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,120
What?

190
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Hey, move!

191
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Don't mind Por. He's retarded.

192
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
And you fell off the motorbike too, right?

193
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Well...yeah...

194
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
When I went to grab the food for you,
I didn't want you all to get hungry.

195
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,040
Next time, if there's anything you want me to help, just tell me.

196
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,040
How did you manage to carry all the food?
I'll go with you next time.

197
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
But I don't want to be anyone's burden.

198
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,680
I've never said that you're a burden.

199
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
But I don't want to feel that way.

200
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,680
I'll just do it myself. And Jin, you do your part.

201
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,200
Uncle Dang was fast.

202
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Damn right.

203
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Guys, hi. I bought the food for you.

204
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
Fluke, what the hell are you doing?

205
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
Right, Greasy, you play the murderer today.

206
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Huh?

207
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
Isn't that Tee's role?

208
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,920
I don't want him to play.
I want you to play instead.

209
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,520
You just can't change stuff all of a sudden.
How could that work?

210
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,000
I wrote specifically whose role belongs to whom.

211
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
One more thing, didn't we shoot so much already?

212
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
How could you just change like this?

213
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Then reshoot.

214
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,680
I'm the director. It's my call.
I can do anything.

215
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Or you got a problem with that?

216
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,560
But the script, I was the one who wrote it.

217
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
But it's my money.

218
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
If I want something, I'll get it my way.

219
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Can you just do what I say, Greasy?

220
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,200
No, I won't do it.

221
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,960
If you don't do it, do I have to beg you or something?

222
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,360
If you don't do it, just get the hell out of here already.

223
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,360
We can still shoot without you.

224
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Alright, then give me back my script.

225
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Shit, Por.

226
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,080
The script is in my hands. It's gotta be mine.

227
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,520
If you want it, tell your Dad to come sue me.

228
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Non.

229
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Non.

230
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Non, don't go yet.

231
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Come back and let's talk.

232
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,960
Talk? Will talk work, Jin?

233
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
No one wants me here.

234
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
There is. Me.

235
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,800
There's only you, Jin. What good will that do?

236
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,280
I know that you're mad, Non. But if you leave now...

237
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,200
everything that you've worked for will mean nothing.

238
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,600
Non, you said you wanted to make a film and finish it.

239
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
But doing this, it's like you don't value what I wrote.

240
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,480
Por is an idiot for changing this and that.

241
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
But let's see it the other way.
Non, you're a part of this project.

242
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,960
It's just that your role will change from being a writer to an actor.

243
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It's good in another way, don't you think?

244
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,880
But I don't wanna play a murderer.

245
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,720
There're many villain characters with good acting, and many people like them.

246
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,720
One more thing, it's good that you get to play a murderer.

247
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,880
You wrote him. You must understand him the most, right?

248
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Will it really be better if I go back?

249
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes.

250
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
The mask, shit!

251
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The mask!

252
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,800
Ahhhh!

253
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Cut! Cut! Cut!

254
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,480
Fuck! Top! Why would you say cut?

255
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,680
I was the one who said that.

256
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,320
Didn't you see? Greasy was about to fucking kill me.

257
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,320
He's just into the character.

258
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,920
Hey, Greasy played the murderer so well.

259
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,440
Good footage that we got here.

260
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Hey, let me see.

261
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Go, go. Change the setting. This one is done.

262
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Non, you played so well earlier.

263
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,480
If you had played this character from the beginning,
we might not have had to reshoot.

264
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Not really.

265
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
It's all messed up because of me anyway.

266
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
When the movie's done,
they will know that they can't do it without you.

267
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
The test results are here.

268
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,600
Each of you check your scores.

269
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,600
And I'll tell you one by one what needs to be improved.

270
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,600
There are many incorrect answers. You have to go review it.

271
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,240
You got full score, Non, but you forgot to write your name.

272
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Come see me when the class is over.

273
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
Close the door.

274
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Come sit.

275
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Tell me, what were you daydreaming about?
How could you forget to write your name?

276
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
I didn't mean to.

277
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,560
You do know, right? If it were a real exam,
even you got all the answers right,

278
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,840
you would still lose everything.

279
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
I'll be more careful.

280
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,880
You're a good student, Non.

281
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,600
I can see that you're having a problem right now.

282
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,120
If there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

283
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
If your mind is troubled like this, you won't be able to study.

284
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,240
I...

285
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
Let me guess, you're having a problem with your friends, aren't you?

286
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Not really.

287
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,840
About my friends...I'm used to it now.

288
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,440
I have a problem with...

289
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
With?

290
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Money.

291
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Money? Did you owe someone?

292
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Do you want to borrow mine first?

293
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No!

294
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,920
I can't. It's a lot of money.

295
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,920
How much money? Thousands of Baht?

296
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,440
Many thousands of Baht.

297
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Compound interest. I don't really know much about it.

298
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Well, just think that I didn't tell you anything. I'm sorry.

299
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Wait.

300
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,760
When are you going to stop saying that you're sorry?

301
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm not scolding you at all.

302
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,760
Could you tell me what happened?

303
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I promise you that I'll find a way out for you.

304
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,960
It's alright. You're with me now.

305
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,120
I'll help you.

306
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,120
You don't have to worry about this so you'll be able to focus on your study.

307
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,400
How...how will you help me?

308
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,040
That's a great amount of money.
Where will you get it?

309
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Right now, I have around 300,000 Baht.

310
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
You can use it to pay off your debt.

311
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
But...but that's your money.

312
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I'm causing you trouble.

313
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:04,280
That amount of money in exchange of your life, I think it's worth it.

314
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
I see you as a brother.

315
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
Would you accept my offer?

316
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Thank you.

317
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,120
From now on, you gotta tell me everything.

318
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm ready to take care of you, Non.

319
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,240
Hello, Non.

320
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,440
Where are you? Wanna meet up? I'll pick you up.

321
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,440
It's alright. I'm about to go home from the tutoring school.

322
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Well, I'll hurry and be there in 15 minutes.

323
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,640
You don't have to.

324
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,880
Why would you speed? It's dangerous.

325
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,880
And I'm kinda tired and sick.
I just wanna go home now.

326
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Okay, then when you get home, call me.

327
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Alright, see ya.

328
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Non, how are you going home? Do you want a ride?

329
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Non, hello.

330
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
Thank you.

331
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Oh, it's nothing. No big deal.

332
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Well, I'd better get going.

333
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Goodbye.

334
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Phee, what are you doing here?

335
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Why?

336
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,560
Why can't I come here?

337
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,640
Or do you not want me to come here?

338
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
Phee.

339
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,800
What's the relationship between you and that teacher?

340
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,920
The reason that you didn't answer my text...

341
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,920
that you didn't wanna talk to me is because of that teacher, right?

342
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,160
What is it? So you like other people more than me, something like that?

343
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Phee, Mr. Keng and I aren't a thing.

344
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,320
He's just a teacher, and I'm a student.

345
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,720
There's nothing more than that.

346
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Non, but this is far from normal.

347
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Look at your shirt.

348
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Normally, you don't let you shirt out like that.

349
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Phee...

350
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Just tell me, Non. What did you do?

351
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:11,040
Well...I...feel uncomfortable with those people.

352
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,920
Our friends.

353
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,920
When the teacher knew this, he comforted me.

354
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
But there's really nothing more.

355
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Phee.

356
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,960
You being like this, you don't seem to trust me at all.

357
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,239
Please, Phee, can you trust me for once?

358
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
So between you and that teacher...there's nothing, right?

359
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Yes.

360
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,000
You two didn't cross the line?

361
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
No, we didn't.

362
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Okay, okay.

363
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,040
I believe you, Non.

364
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
Phee.

365
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Let's go. Let's go home.

366
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
C'mon.

367
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Okay.

368
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Pretty as always.

369
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Here. 300,000-ish Baht in cash.
You should hurry and give it to the boss.

370
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
Where did you get the money?

371
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,600
You don't need to know that.
I almost clear off my debt.

372
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
And we can go separate ways.

373
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Right, Tee, you too. If you have a chance,
you should get out of that place. It's dangerous.

374
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,040
People aren't always lucky.

375
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,280
to Top: ”I need a favor."

376
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,120
So did your friends know where you got the money?

377
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,040
No, I didn't want you to get into trouble.

378
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,040
Just about the money, you've helped me enough.

379
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,160
How about the horse accounts gangsters?

380
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,760
I'm trying to get away from them.

381
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,760
That's good. I don't think you should get involved with those people again.

382
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,400
to Tee: ”I know who gave Non money."

383
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Are you alright?

384
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,880
Go buy another one.

385
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
And you can come sit with us.

386
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,760
Why are you being nice to Greasy?

387
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Haven't we talked about this?
We will let him stay with us until we finish shooting.

388
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,720
But we haven't finished shooting yet. Why complaining?

389
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,920
I can do it without him.

390
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,600
Then the next cue, I won't let him go there.

391
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,200
You just don't want him to be comfortable during the shoot, do you?

392
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
It's just a small matter. How hard can it be?

393
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Why? Are you gonna help me mess him up?

394
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,920
You don't need to know now.
I'll do it my way. Go ahead and eat.

395
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,040
Joy: Keng, thank you for the information you sent me.

396
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,520
Joy: I'm ready to do the news on the scammers that fool the students.

397
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Joy: But we need a valid proof.

398
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Joy, are you up today?

399
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
Mr. Keng: Where should I start?

400
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,600
Joy: Start by getting to this place.

401
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Joy: I heard that the local know what's up there in this building.

402
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Why are you looking at Tee's instagram?

403
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Nothing, just taking a look.

404
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,320
I'm just worried about Tee like I'm worried about you.

405
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,120
I just want to help Tee out of that cycle too.

406
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
How will you help him?

407
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Tee isn't in debts. He's one of theirs.

408
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,080
So I intend to expose all of these scammers.

409
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,040
Students will be safe.

410
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Are you out of your mind? That's really dangerous.

411
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,400
What if you get killed?

412
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,880
Believe me. I got a way.

413
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,600
If we don't expose them now,
they will get to us or they might threaten to kill you again.

414
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:11,600
So, this is the only way to get you out of this cycle.

415
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Trust me.

416
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Trust me.

417
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,640
Do you think Mr. Keng will be here?

418
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,360
I think so...or where else could he be?

419
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,600
That's true.

420
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,520
This room?

421
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,840
Yeah, this is Mr. Keng's room.

422
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Hey.

423
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
What's that noise?

424
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
One sec.

425
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,240
Fluke, yesterday, I didn't...

426
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,240
Hey, what the hell, Jin?
What are you talking about?

427
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
I don't know anything.

428
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
I'm going to the restroom.

429
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Mr. Keng, I really don't know how the video leaked...

430
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,560
It's alright. We'll fix this. You just calm down.

431
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
Hey!

432
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,560
Come here.

433
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,960
I think you should calm down.

434
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
Calm? The fuck with that.

435
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
I think you misunderstood something.

436
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,720
The fuck with that.

437
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Why did you fuck my partner?

438
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,160
So you're still being the same as before, huh?

439
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
Phee.

440
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm really sorry.

441
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
Can you stop being so upset?

442
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,920
I love you, Phee.

443
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,120
Love? Is this love?!

444
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,920
Isn't having only me enough?

445
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,920
What's the bad in me?

446
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,080
Phee.

447
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,680
I shouldn't have trusted a guy like you.

448
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Phee.

449
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,000
Phee. Don't go yet.

450
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Phee, I'm sorry.

451
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,040
I'm sorry. Can you forgive me?

452
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,080
You want me to forgive you?
Just get lost and die.

453
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Phee...Phee...

454
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,600
The less time we have, the more people we need.

455
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,000
I think no matter what, we still need Greasy to come back and help us.

456
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,920
After we start shooting, it'll be a while before having a rest.

457
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,240
Some water?

458
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
You go get him for me!

459
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
Top! Look out!

460
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,880
These businessmen sent a threat letter to kill me.

461
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
Including killing you too.

462
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
You're a fucking liar!
