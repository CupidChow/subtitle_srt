2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,440
Right now, the murderer is heading home.

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Right now, there's no one. Only Top came home.

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
Por!

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,040
There are lots of dead people here, and we'll become suspects?

6
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,160
Well, Top is the killer!

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,880
No!

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
I know you all so well. You're fuckers.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,120
You all know what you did three years ago!

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,880
Hey, Tee, you bought a new character again?

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Yeah.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,560
Man, the skin is fucking pricey. Pay for me.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,240
What the fuck? If you want money, go clean the toilet at Por's.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,240
No, my parents would kill me.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,520
Guys, this is interesting.

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
There will be a short film contest for students.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,400
The subject is Modern Thai.

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
The winner will get the budget to make a movie
that will be played in the festival.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,800
What? That sounds boring.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,200
The short film festivals aren't held very often.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,320
And you know, if anyone's movie is shown in the event, I'm telling ya,
we could add it into our portfolios, and any uni would want us.

22
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
See? Jin knows.

23
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,040
Hey, so...how should we do it?
This portfolio thing is stressing me out.

24
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,840
That's easy. In two weeks, there will a pitching.

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,480
It's a little too soon but if we help each other, I think we'll make it.

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
Are you nuts? There's no way we'll make it.

27
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,240
We'll definitely make it. I got an idea.

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,880
I want to make a movie about a psycopath murderer
hunting people in an enclosed area.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,240
And the location will be my vacation home.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,680
How is that Modern Thai? Have you read the subject?

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Well, if you make it like any other original Thai, it will look like others'.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
If you wanna shine, you gotta be different.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,960
And who will write the script?

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Modern Thai...and different...that's not easy.

35
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I don't think we should do it.
If we can't do it as we think, we'll be disappointed.

36
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,079
Hey, Tee, Tee!

37
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,079
Hey! Tee, Tee, Tee, Tee, Tee!

38
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
What?

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Don't you really want to do the movie?
I think it's interesting.

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,160
If you guys wanna do it, go ahead.
I just think that it's not worth it.

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,160
But if you don't to it, others won't want to do it too.

42
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,720
But I wanna do it.

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,680
So you can put that in your portfolio for Faculty of Medicine, right?

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,160
Tee, it's not only Fluke who will get to put this in his portfolio.

45
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,520
Jin also wants to study Communication Arts.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,520
If we succeed, someone could buy our work,...
or we could sell the tickets for people to come see it.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sell the tickets?

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,519
Just don't make me write the screenplay.
I don't know how to do it.

49
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,520
Then, we'll have a meeting tomorrow.
You just come up with an awesome idea, Tee.

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Alright, I'm off.

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,640
I think each of you should throw in an idea...

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,800
for what you want to happen in the movie.

53
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,200
Should we think about the objective of our movie first?

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,200
And then we should think about the beginning, the middle and the ending.

55
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,520
But I don't think we'll make it.
We only got two weeks until the pitching day.

56
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,920
We must have the script ready by now.

57
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,240
Por, you know how to write it, so don't you rush it.

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Well, if you know how to write, go ahead.
Don't just argue with me.

59
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I only know the basic writing.
I don't know how to write in entirely.

60
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Then how about this?
We want to put Thainess in to this, right?

61
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Then why don't we wear thai traditional costume
and do thai dancing along with the music in the house?

62
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Asshole, my movie will become a comedy.

63
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:42,159
Hey, or should we do a period movie?
Go rent some Thai costume and just shoot?

64
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Hey, Greasy head, there's no shampoo here.
If you wanna wash you hair, just go home and do it.

65
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Make it found footage.

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A story about a group of friends visiting a house on a secluded hill.

67
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,200
Found footage, like The Blair Witch Project?

68
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Yes. In the story, everyone will meet a murderer who wears a mask.

69
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,840
We will meet that murderer in different ways.

70
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,440
And we gotta find a way to survive from his brutal hunt.

71
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,520
What is he talking about?

72
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,520
That's what I thought. Greasy head is so lame.
That's why no one wants to talk to him.

73
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Where were we?

74
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,680
I think what Non said is really interesting.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,280
I don't even understand a fucking word he's saying.

76
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Let's make it a found footage like a Youtuber
going on a trip taking a Vlog, something like that.

77
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,120
I think Non's storyline is awesome.

78
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,520
If you think it's cool, get that Greasy head to write the script for us.

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
Isn't his name Non? Why do you all call him Greasy head?

80
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,640
It doesn't matter what his name is.
And, what do you guys think about having him write the screenplay.

81
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't know. I don't want that weirdo involved.
Having him around is frustrating.

82
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I don't want him in too.

83
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,680
But look at us. If we write the scrip ourselves, we'll be doomed.

84
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Well, ask him yourselves. I won't go.

85
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
And who's gonna go with me?

86
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Talk to him for me.

87
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Isn't it your project? Ask him yourself.

88
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Only you know how to talk to him. C'mon, man.

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Please.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Non.

91
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,919
Jin.

92
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Yes?

93
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,160
Yesterday, the plot you told us about...

94
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,160
We really liked it so we wanted to have you as our screenwriter of our short movie.

95
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,880
A short movie?

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Yeah, just like in the books you always read.

97
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
And I've heard that you like writing horror novel online...

98
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
It's not easy to have this kind of opportunity.

99
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360
I want you to take it, so you won't regret it later.

100
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
But I've never written a script for a movie before.

101
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Non.

102
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,280
We believe that you can do it.

103
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,440
The story is about a group of five friends going on a trip to a secluded village on a hill.

104
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,440
There's also a rumor about the mass massacre of Janta cult.

105
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,800
In this story, everyone will meet a murderer who wears a mask.

106
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
The murderer will hunt anyone who comes to do life sacrifice.

107
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Greasy, I still don't like the ending of the story.

108
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Can you go fix it and send me another version?
And, do it digitally. I don't want any more papers.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Alright, I'll fix it and send you the file.

110
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Only ten days left, Greasy. I want it...PERFECT.

111
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,520
And give me more screen time.
Like, the action scene. Make me shine. Got it?

112
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,760
Would you guys stop calling Non...Greasy?

113
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Well, his name is Greasy. Everyone calls him Greasy.
What do you want me to call you?

114
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,360
It's alright. Anything is fine with me.

115
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Greasy is always a Greasy.

116
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
You're still here?

117
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Oh, yeah, I wanna finish writing this scene first.
Just a bit left.

118
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Non, you seem to enjoy writing the script.

119
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,920
I like watching movies so I've been wanting to try to write a movie script for a long time.

120
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,560
And...Jin, you like watching movies too?

121
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah, I love watching movies very much.

122
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Can I see it?

123
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
I wanna suggest that this part when the main character runs away
from the murderer for the first time,

124
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,720
let him carry the camera, taking selfie of himself
so we can see his scared face of him clearly.

125
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Mmm.

126
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Hello. I'm still at school
 In a middle of something now. Will go home soon.

127
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm gonna get going now.

128
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,200
Alright, see you tomorrow.

129
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Bye.

130
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,240
You got here before Non.

131
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Lately, Non comes home kinda late. Do you think so?

132
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,640
It's good that Non's still not home. I wanna talk to you.

133
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
What about?

134
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Well, this month, we won't be able to send the money to New.

135
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Because we only have the money to pay for the credit card.

136
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Then don't pay for the credit card yet. Send it to New first.
How could he live without the money from us?

137
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,040
But we can't, really, this time.
You need to call our kid and tell the reason.

138
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
I'll make an emergency loan.

139
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Hey, you're here. Eat something.

140
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Slowly, dear. You'll choke on it.

141
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
I must hurry and finish my work.

142
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,120
Do you have a lot of homework?
You seem quite busy these days.

143
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You had your lights on all night last night.
Like, you didn't get any sleep.

144
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I've got a short film project with my friends.

145
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,120
Did you friends ask you to join?

146
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Yes, they did.

147
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Even though you got lots of things to do, make sure you get enough rest.

148
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I don't want to see you too stressed and have to go to the hospital, okay?

149
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,880
You need to prioritize things, Non.

150
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
You need to invest in something important, like your study.

151
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,480
And when you succeed, you will get to go study abroad like New.

152
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Non!

153
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Have you taken the medicine?

154
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,720
Non: Yes.

155
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,200
Jin: Are you home?

156
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
Hey, the script is fucking great.

157
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Ass, Greasy hasn't even finished the script yet.
When did you read it?

158
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,440
Hey, Greasy, isn't my air time too little?

159
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,440
I told you to write to make me shine.
My character is very important.

160
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Rewrite it! C'mon, do it now.

161
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Hey, Greasy, I think the escape from home scene can be more exciting.

162
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,440
From all that I've read, I don't think it's interesting yet.

163
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,360
Would you stop distracting Non?

164
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,840
Just wait for him to finish it first and then comment.

165
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Well, there are only seven days left.
If we don't comment now, then we're not gonna make it.

166
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Hey, Greasy, I don't think you spend enough time with us with the script.
Maybe the time at the school isn't enough.

167
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,960
So how about this?
You come with us to continue at our tutoring school.

168
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
I'll pay for the course for you.
If there's anything to be fixed, you can do it.

169
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,240
Right, Tee?

170
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Yeah, that's good. Do it.

171
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Can anyone solve this equation?

172
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
It's 1/7.

173
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,920
Good job. What's your name?

174
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
It's Greasy.

175
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I didn't ask you. You, what's your name?

176
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
It's Non.

177
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Okay, Non got it right. I'll tell your classmates why it's 1/7.

178
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Hey, I was just joking earlier.
I had to stay awake. Don't overthink.

179
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,240
Mom, hello.

180
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,480
Where were you? Why are you so late?

181
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,920
I...went to a tutoring school.

182
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,920
A tutoring school? Where? And who paid for the course?

183
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
A friend did.

184
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,560
So, Greasy, c'mon.

185
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Hey, move. My beloved Greasy will sit here.

186
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,240
Do you get it? I don't like how the murderer shows his weakness directly.

187
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,240
A murderer must look cooler than that.
Fix it and then send it to me tomorrow.

188
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,760
Are you going home now?

189
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
How about you guys?

190
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
Yeah.

191
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Why would there be an escalator?

192
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:00,440
Guys, I've finished the script.

193
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,360
Really, Greasy? You're the best, our beloved Greasy.

194
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Right, Top? RIght?

195
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Yes, you're awesome, man.

196
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Weirdo.

197
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,240
What did you say?

198
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,280
No, nothing.

199
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm gonna get going now.

200
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,640
You're gonna go now?

201
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Yeah, see ya.

202
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Let's go, Fluke.

203
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,840
See you.

204
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,760
See ya.

205
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,480
Yeah, see you!

206
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Alright, see you.

207
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Non.

208
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,240
How are you going home?

209
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Er, I'll get a cab.

210
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
It's hard to get a cab here. Can I give you a ride?

211
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Damn. Nearly got it, man. One more, one more.
You'll win this round for sure.

212
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
Man, almost got it.

213
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Next round. I can feel it.

214
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
What the hell did you do?!
Why did you let the owner of the mule account be arrested.

215
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,320
If it traces back to me, you're fucked too.

216
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,800
I'm sorry, Boss.

217
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,800
You know how much money I lost?
You must be responsible for it.

218
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,440
Get the money from the kids' parents!

219
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,600
Yes, sir.

220
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
And why are you still here? Go!

221
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Tee, get over here.

222
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,920
Yes, Uncle.

223
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,680
In a dangerous time like this, and you're loitering?

224
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Find the kid to open me the account within 3 days.

225
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,400
But it's not so easy to find, Uncle.

226
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,840
You must find one.
The customer will transfer a large amount of money to me.

227
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,480
But...

228
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,640
No buts!

229
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,640
If you can't do it, I won't pay you.
And your Dad won't get the medicine.

230
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,440
So you're still here?
If you can't do it, don't you ever get into my sight again.

231
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,680
The Hidden Character, I believe that our short film is very unique and interesting.

232
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,920
Because we're gonna film it as a found footage.

233
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,920
We're going to take you to solve the mystery that happens in the sealed house on the hill.

234
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,000
The synopsis of The Hidden Character is...

235
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,920
A group of five friends going on a trip and stay at a vacation home on the hill.

236
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,440
It is where one cult resides. It's called Janta Cult.

237
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:05,320
The legend says people come to sacrifice their lives here.

238
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,440
Because they have to meet with the sixth person who wears a mask.

239
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,440
But all five friends will see the shape of the mask differently.

240
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,120
The result is here.

241
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,160
And the team that is chosen to get the budget to make a short film is...

242
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:12,400
is...The Hidden Character.

243
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Awesome. So great.

244
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,480
Whoa, Greasy, how did you get here?

245
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Oh, Jin told me that the pitching would take place here, so I came.

246
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Non is the writer so he should be here with us
when they announce the result, shouldn't he?

247
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Alright, alright.

248
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Anyway, let's take a photo, make a memory.

249
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Hey, get in!

250
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
I don't think there's enough space.

251
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,240
Hey, could you take a pic for us?

252
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Yes.

253
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,080
Just press the button here.

254
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,920
Okay.

255
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Alright.

256
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
One...Two...

257
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,480
Thanks.

258
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Okay.

259
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Thanks.

260
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,320
Here, Non, thank you for writing the script for us.

261
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Oh, this is for me?

262
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Yes, as a thank-you gift from us.

263
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Well, I wanna thank you all too for allowing me to do what I like.

264
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,960
We're so awesome, guys.
There are so many people entering this contest, but we got it.

265
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,000
I think we got it because of Por's Dad's last name.

266
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,440
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

267
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
No, it's because of the good script Non wrote.

268
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,200
Hey, Jin, I've noticed this so many times.

269
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
Why are you being nice to Greasy?

270
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
Or is there something going on with you two?

271
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Non helped us with all he got.
Why shouldn't I be nice to him?

272
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,640
And look at you all.
You didn't tell him the place and time of the pitching.

273
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,080
And the BBQ pork, you didn't let me invite him.

274
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,120
Well, Greasy's job is done.

275
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,120
Right now, it's the production team's job.
We don't need him anymore, do we?

276
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,040
One more thing, you should stop talking to him, Jin.

277
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Por, is it possible that our movie will be played in the theatres,
and people will come buy the tickets to come and see it?

278
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,280
That's what I thought of in the first place.

279
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,280
I think our movie is for people to buy ticket to see.

280
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
I think if the movie gets shown in the festival, that's good enough.

281
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,480
Hey, but we put so much effort into this.
We might spend more money than the budget we got.

282
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Por, hurry up and tell your Dad to have all the cinemas ready for us.

283
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Alright, I'll manage that.

284
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,400
You want some apple, dear?

285
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,040
Yes.

286
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Here.

287
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,200
I heard that you got the budget for the short film, yes?

288
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Yes, Mom.

289
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
My son is doing better that I thought.

290
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
With that face, what do you want?

291
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Well, I got the budget to make the movie
so I want to make it look as good as I can.

292
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Is it possible that I get the camera that we went to see the other day?

293
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Huh? That's like a hundred thousands of Baht.

294
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Well, my friends and I plan to have the movie shown in cinemas,
and we will also sell the tickets.

295
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,920
If our work turns out good, the profit will cover the camera's price.

296
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,920
And I'd like to ask you if you will be able to find a shortcut for me.

297
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,360
Hmmm, how about this? I'll try talking to my friends who own the cinema.

298
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:39,360
And when your movie is shown, I'll invite the press to make the news for you.

299
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Just a short film...why do you have to use that high quality camera?

300
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,200
It must be camera with adequate specs
because the moive will be shown on a big screen.

301
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,400
And if our kid can make it good, he will gain fame,
and that's a pro for you too.

302
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Think of it this way, the only son of a Member of the House of Representatives,
Ekkachai, directed a movie while he's still a student at a uni.

303
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Any press would want to make that kind of news, don't you think?

304
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Oh, well, okay.

305
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Well, if you're gonna go that big, you can't embarrass me.

306
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Yes, I will not let you two down, never.

307
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,160
Hello, Por.

308
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,480
Por, Hello.

309
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Hi.

310
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Hi, Por.

311
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,720
We're leaving.

312
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Let's go.

313
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Director Por's filming set is ready.

314
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,760
What? Why did you bring it here today?
Are we shooting today?

315
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,320
I brought it here to make you guys confident.

316
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,360
So you'll all know that our team won't lose.

317
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,880
Man, that's awesome.

318
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Can I have a look?

319
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Por, may I?

320
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Yeah.

321
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,000
Hey, be gentle with it.

322
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Alright.

323
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,360
I tried to look, but there's no one.

324
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,360
You haven't tried hard enough. Get someone by tomorrow.

325
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,520
Can I have more time?

326
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,680
No.

327
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,960
The money from the customer is coming.

328
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,960
If you don't succeed, you won't get any monthly earning from now on.

329
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Even if we're related, I won't feed those who are useless to me.

330
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Shit.

331
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,320
Ahem. Don't worry, everyone. I'm here to help you from the murderer.

332
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Whoever messes with my friends must get through me.

333
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
I'm definitely fabulous.

334
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
One more, one more.

335
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Oh, fuck!

336
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Fuck! What the fuck did you do, Top?

337
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,200
I didn't do anything. It just fell.

338
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
How could it fall by itself?

339
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Fuck.

340
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Fuck!

341
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,720
What should I do, Tee?
I don't have money to pay him!

342
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,120
I don't know, but you gotta tell Por that you dropped it.

343
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,120
No! He would kill me if he knew.

344
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
Help me, Tee!

345
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
How would I help you?

346
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Fuck!

347
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,640
You don't have to be the one who pays for this.

348
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
How so?

349
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Just do as I say, okay?

350
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Shit!

351
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Don't tell anyone about this.

352
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Non, what are you doing?

353
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Tee, hi!

354
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm sorry I haven't been talking to you so much.

355
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,440
At first, we thought we would only bother you with the screenplay only.

356
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,800
But right now, we all talked about it.

357
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,640
We want you in the production team as well.

358
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,240
Would that be alright?

359
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,760
Of course. The position that we need is the cameraman.

360
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,280
Because Por will only be the director.

361
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
And the rest will be actors.

362
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,600
But I don't know how to use a camera.

363
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Hey, it's not hard.
Grab the camera. I'll teach you.

364
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,880
Maybe we can do that later.

365
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
Well, we can do it now.
We still have time before the teacher comes in.

366
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Are you sure?

367
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Yes.

368
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,680
You, fucking Greasy!
What the fuck are you doing?

369
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,480
Get up! Get up!

370
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,160
I'm sorry. I was about to bring the camera to Tee.

371
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Why would you do that?

372
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Give that camera to me!

373
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Greasy, you broke my camera!

374
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
What? Let me see.

375
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,080
I think this looks like it fell and hit the floor directly.

376
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,000
I suspect you, Tee.

377
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Why would you have Non get the camera?

378
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,520
I was about to ask him to be our cameraman
so I wanted to teach him how to use the camera.

379
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,600
But we got Por as our cameraman.

380
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,600
Oh then it's my mistake.
I thought Por would only be the director.

381
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,640
I was just trying to find help.

382
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,560
I don't know. If it fell, it fell.
If it's broken, it's broken.

383
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,160
My camera costed two hundred thousand Baht.

384
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
You go ahead and tell your parents to pay me back now!

385
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,800
Or else I would have my Dad go over to your house!

386
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Understood?

387
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Shit, Por!

388
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
What the fuck!

389
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
New, do you have enough money now?

390
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,840
I'm so sorry this month I couldn't send you money sooner.

391
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,840
About the money, don't worry.
I'll find some way to find more money and send it to you, alright?

392
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,040
Pay attention to your study, bye.

393
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Non: Are you free to talk?

394
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Shit!

395
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,800
Why are you so dumb? Fuck!

396
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Dumbass Non.

397
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
Non.

398
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Are you home, Non?

399
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Non!

400
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,400
I think Por's just mad.

401
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,360
Don't worry about paying him back.
His family is wealthy.

402
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:46,360
Just a broken camera, it wouldn't cost them anything.

403
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,360
But we should be resposible for what we did.

404
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,440
Just be responsible for what you can.

405
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,680
How about this? I'm trying to earn more money
by selling the pics I took online.

406
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:13,680
Maybe you could come help me sell them or...
you could be the assistant cameraman.

407
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Jin...

408
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,640
Hundred thousands of Baht...
how could we find it in just a short period of time?

409
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,920
And one more thing, we gotta use that camera within this week.

410
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
How could we find that amount of money?

411
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,800
Right now, we have to do whatever we can do.

412
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,320
Earning little money is better earning no money at all.

413
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,320
I'll keep talking to Por for now, alright?

414
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Thank you so much, Jin, for helping me all along.

415
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,840
It's alright. I'm glad to.

416
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,520
I just want you to smile again, Non.

417
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,520
Like that.

418
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,720
So how's it going? You must be really stressed out.

419
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,760
You broke Por's expensive camera like that.

420
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,760
And the shooting is now postponed.

421
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,600
I'll try to find the money ASAP.

422
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
Did you find some? How did you?

423
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,720
Er...

424
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,560
I'm here just to help you today.

425
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,360
I have a way for you to easily earn big money.

426
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,360
And you don't have to owe it to anyone.

427
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,920
How?

428
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,760
It's easy. You just go to the bank and open a new account.

429
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,720
And then give your account number to me.

430
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,720
That's all. And you'll get ten thousand Baht per account.

431
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,280
And if you can find more people to open the account, you'll get the commission.

432
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,920
Oh and what would you do with the accounts that are opened?

433
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Don't worry about that.
Just forget about those accounts.

434
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,720
It doesn't sound very secure to me.

435
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,720
The accounts that are opened...
I don't know if they will be used for something illegal.

436
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,880
If nothing goes wrong, no one will get caught.

437
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,200
And for the record, the owners of these accounts are safe for years.

438
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,560
And they got hundreds of thousands Baht...

439
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:19,760
But...

440
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,880
Thirty thousand Baht.

441
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,480
If you open the bank account today,
I'll transfer thirty thousand Baht for you right away.

442
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,680
It's up to you. You don't have to do it.
I'm just worried about you, Greasy.

443
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
So what do I have to do?

444
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Follow me.

445
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,840
Your job is to transfer money to the accounts that I send you every day.

446
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,280
Once the money reaches the clients' accounts, your job's done.

447
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,200
But don't do anything outside the plan.

448
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,600
Or else we all will be fucked.

449
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,960
My friend broke the camera...

450
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,520
It's broken?

451
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,880
Don't!!!

452
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,680
I give you one week.

453
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,880
If you can't find the money to fix the camera or get me a new one...

454
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,840
I won't let you go.
