Wait for me!

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,120
Hurry up!

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Hey!

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Let's go the other way.

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,400
No, this way.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,240
No!

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,720
He's coming. Let's go.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Hey!

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Ahhhhh!

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,200
You know what,...

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,680
in this woods,

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,000
no one dares get in...

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,160
because it's where the dwelling of Janta is.

15
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,360
People offer him the living sacrifice

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
in exchange for wishes being granted.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,800
They offer living pigs, ducks, chickens...

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,720
Makes me sick, just thinking about it.

19
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,560
Only his worshippers do that.

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,440
Then they all sacrificed themselves with mass suicide.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Just to worship him, 71 of them.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,720
Last time, you told us it was 17 people. So, what's the real number?

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Yeah. You told us different stories each time. So what is it, Por?

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
Well, I just wanna tell you all.

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,880
My Dad warned me that, so I had to listen to him. I just believe what he says.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,760
You almost made me scared.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,000
That's what my friend does. He likes to fool around.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
Just forget it.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,200
But the one who tricks the younger ones the most,

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,800
Asshole!

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Tee is the best of us.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't envy me.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,240
If you envy me, just find yourselves a partner.

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
If I had one, I would bring one here already?

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Why would you keep repeating that?

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
"Thank you all for your support."

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Deep in the woods like this, your Dad still thanks the people.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Woohoo! Here we come! Woohoo!

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Fluke, are you alright? Do you want Uncle Dang to make a stop first?

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,960
No, I'm alright.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Are you sure?

42
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
We're here! We're here!

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Man, that took forever!

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
That didn't take long.

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
What?

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,440
Throw that away, now!

47
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Oh, right.

48
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Hey, c'mon.

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
You're going back tomorrow evening, aren't you?

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Yes.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Well, I have to do something in the evening. I'll let someone else pick you up.

52
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
Alright.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,520
And when do you want to be picked up?

54
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,160
No need to hurry. Around 9-10 p.m.

55
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,200
Of course.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,520
The guy who's gonna pick us up can drive during the night time, right?

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Yes, he knows the way pretty well.

58
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
Ah, okay.

59
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Then, tomorrow at noon, I'll deliver the goods.

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,120
Don't be late.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,880
Alright, goodbye.

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Goodbye.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,519
Man, we're finally here.

64
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
Yeah, finally.

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,320
That was exhausting.

66
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,720
Fluke, you need to throw that away now.

67
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,400
True. That was a long ride and we had to smell that.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Right.

69
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,040
So? How's my home? You're all so stunned, aren't you?

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,120
Shit, Por! His family is wealthy just like he brags about it.

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,880
How can't they be? His Dad has been a member of House Representatives for years.

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,920
Big businesses in Chiang Mai belongs to him.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
And look at him, a nuthead like this! Who would believe that?

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,440
C'mon.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
Haven't been here in a long time, I freakin' miss this place.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
Here, a living room.

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,320
Do you have an A/C?

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,200
Of course, every room.

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Wooo!

80
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Bottoms up!

81
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Hey! Jin! Don't you pretend that you can't finish the glass!

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,080
This is your going-away party, man!

83
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,840
Are you guys gonna get drunk this early?

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,000
Of course, we're gonna be drunk all day and night.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,480
That's why we've come all the way here.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,360
Jin, bottoms up, man!

87
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,840
Get over here!

88
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

89
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,200
Right, Jin, how many years do you have to study?

90
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Do you have to start all over again?

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,680
What did you study? Photography?

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,680
Yeah, I gotta start all over, I couldn't have my grades transferred.

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
So, it'll take me four years.

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,080
But I'll find a job there in the U.S., won't coming back to Thailand.

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Jin, you're gonna continue your study in L.A.?

96
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,680
If you go visit him, Tee, tag me along.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,720
No need to find an excuse to visit Jin.

98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,120
If I have enough money, I'll take you there myself, White.

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,360
Oooh, shit.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't act like you're the only two people in this world, okay?

101
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
That's true.

102
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,600
What pic will you post?

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Hey, let me have that too.

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Por, don't you have  Wi-Fi? I can't seem to download anything.

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,360
White, we're in the middle of the woods.

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Aside from the landline, there's no other way to communicate with the outside world.

107
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,320
So, party till you drop.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,320
What happens here stays here. No one will know.

109
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
But I'm bored.

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
So you're not gonna be doing anything else but drinking, three days straight?

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, right.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,520
How about this? If you're bored, then let's watch a movie.

113
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah, let's. C'mon now.

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Fluke, come sit here beside me. It's crowded and lonely there.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Sit on my lap, c'mon.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,040
What the heck? What do you have on, Phee? I want something fun!

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Okay, let me find something here.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,680
Hey, I don't think that's the one.

119
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,320
What? What? A Porn? Phee, put that on!

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Alright.

121
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Okay.

122
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
What's this? Jin plays the main character?

123
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Well, not really. It's just a short film I made when I was in the 11th grade for the contest.

124
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Ooh, kinda fun.

125
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,360
Who wore the mask?

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Why haven't you ever brought him to us?

127
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,280
It's Non. He's not here anymore.

128
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,480
You two got in when we were in 12th grade so you never met him.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you mean by he's not here anymore?

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,880
He's dead?

131
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Not here means he's not around anymore.

132
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,440
He just disappeared.

133
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
But I think, he didn't just disappear.

134
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Since he's disappeared, no one sees him again.

135
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I think he might be dead already.

136
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,120
Hey, hey, hey, it may not be like that.

137
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Your friend might just move. Don't overthink.

138
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,400
Hey, but I want to remake the film.

139
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
Well, I got a camera in this house.

140
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Por!

141
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,600
Hey, guys, it's good. We don't need to think of any new ideas.

142
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,520
Just continue shooting from where you guys left off.

143
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
Right? Making new memory...

144
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,480
Jin's about to go abroad, and you won't see him again.

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Actually, I wanna see you all do it too.

146
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,080
So shall we? Let's go.

147
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Tee, c'mon!

148
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Alright.

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,360
Right. Do whatever you want. You wanna shoot? Shoot.

150
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Alright, let's go.

151
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
C'mon.

152
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
Why do we have to actually do this?

153
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
Just do what Phee wishes to do?

154
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,320
I don't wanna do it.

155
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,120
Wait, you're not doing what Phee wishes to do.

156
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,120
You're doing it for you beloved White, buddy.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,800
Why do you have to be so cranky?

158
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,240
They just wanna do it for fun. Phee studies directing too.

159
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,240
I just don't want him to get involved with what we have done.

160
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,960
Or do you want him to find out more?

161
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,000
If he finds out, and what?

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,440
It ended a long time ago.

163
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,640
C'mon, we're here for Jin's going-away party.

164
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Don't ruin it.

165
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
C'mon.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
Here, listen to me.

167
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,680
You'll be running out of that door.

168
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,480
And then you'll run that way with Jin.

169
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
But along the way, you had to fall down, around here.

170
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,880
Okay?

171
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,400
Okay.

172
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,840
And, how do you want me to act?

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,120
Well, you're running away from a bad guy. It's like he's trying to kill you.

174
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
So you come running out all scared.

175
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
And then fall, here. Let me show you.

176
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,800
Around here.

177
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
See? Okay.

178
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,560
Okay, I'll tell Jin what to do.

179
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Okay.

180
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,640
Okay, Jin, for you...

181
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,400
I know what I have to do.

182
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
It's the same.

183
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
So?

184
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Better?

185
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,160
Better, my ass.

186
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
He didn't even wanna look at my face.

187
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
C'mon, at least, he spoke one sentence.

188
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,440
Did you bring your inhaler?

189
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Of course, I wouldn't dare leave it.

190
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,200
Speed!

191
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
And action!

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
Ouch!

193
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Are you alright?

194
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Cut!

195
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,520
Hey, hey! Wait, why did you say cut?

196
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,640
Who's in the way for the star to shine?

197
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm about to shine, man.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What's the problem? Why'd you say cut?

199
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,120
There's no such scene in the original version.

200
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm the director. It's my job to decide what's best.

201
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,680
C'mon, man.

202
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,040
We're just doing this for fun. It'll get better.

203
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
It's not fun anymore.

204
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,480
Don't you think that you're the director and you can change anything.

205
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,440
This movie is not yours.

206
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,720
I'm here to drink.

207
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm not here to do this crazy ass movie.

208
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Tee.

209
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,200
I was the one who proposed this idea to Phee.

210
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
Tee, don't be mad at other people.

211
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,320
I just want everyone to enjoy it more.

212
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Alright, alright.

213
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,840
Tee, you get in the house.

214
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Drink as much as you want.

215
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Damn.

216
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,120
This one?

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Yeah.

218
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Focus.

219
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,680
Guys, where is everyone?

220
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I thought we're gonna have a blast.

221
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,320
I don't know.

222
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,640
Neither do I.

223
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,680
I'll go find them.

224
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,119
Wild animals may get them during the night.

225
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,119
Alright.

226
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,359
So?

227
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
Continue.

228
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,240
It's Top's turn.

229
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
My turn.

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Tee.

231
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,240
I thought we agreed that you'd be nice if I brought you here.

232
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
You'd be obedient.

233
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
C'mon, Tee.

234
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I'm obedient.

235
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,080
And one more thing, it's just acting.

236
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,320
Why would you be mad at me, Tee?

237
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,880
I hope you're telling the truth.

238
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
I am!

239
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
What?

240
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
You stink of beer.

241
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Hey, Tee!

242
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
What?

243
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,120
It's like someone's watching us...

244
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,880
from the woods.

245
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,880
Other people are in the house. Who would be watching us?

246
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,840
White, don't be naughty.

247
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm not.

248
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Who's that?

249
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Who is it?

250
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Jin.

251
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,240
How long are you going to avoid me?

252
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,480
What are you talking about?

253
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,600
So you going abroad...

254
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,600
and never coming back...is your plan, right?

255
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
What if it's a yes, then what?

256
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,200
I just wanted to know...that why you never wanted to ask me...

257
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,920
what we are for all these times?

258
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,840
Friends, indeed.

259
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Friends, like you used to tell me. Did you forget it?

260
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,640
But friends don't do what we did.

261
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Right, friends don't do that.

262
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
But you insisted that we were just friends.

263
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,840
Years have passed,

264
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,840
and you still have the guts to ask what we were?

265
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,280
Have you been missing me?

266
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Or my moves?

267
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,440
Ouch! Why the hell did you bite?

268
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,240
What's wrong with you?

269
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
So you think that I'm still as easy as before, huh?

270
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,080
If you want to do it that much, you can do someone else.

271
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,240
Stop trying to bring it back.

272
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,200
You and I, we're through a long time ago.

273
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,440
If you wanna do it, ask Tan.

274
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,680
How many times have I told you?

275
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,280
Tan and I are just friends.

276
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,680
We've never crossed the line like you thought, not even once.

277
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,680
You and I are friends too, and we never had a thing.

278
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,840
The thing that I did earlier, whomever I do it with, it'll all be the same.

279
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
How could it be?

280
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,920
Well, I'm not the same person you know anymore.

281
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,280
Love is love. Sex is sex.

282
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,720
These two things are not related.

283
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,280
In the past, you and I...we just...

284
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,280
exercised together, nothing more.

285
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,400
So you're telling me that you've never liked me all these times?

286
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,600
Say it, I dare you.

287
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,120
If you say it, I promise you I'll never mess with you ever again.

288
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
So say it.

289
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Ah.

290
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,760
What the hell?

291
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Didn't you hear that?

292
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,200
Huh?

293
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,440
Forget it. I'm out.

294
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Hey, you're running away from me again, huh?

295
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I'm so sick of this. You always run away from the problems.

296
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Right, I'm a coward. Happy now?

297
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,760
Now, get out of my life.

298
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Hey, Jin!

299
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
Shit!

300
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Ah!

301
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
I see stars on the ceiling.

302
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
Are you high, Top?

303
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Nope, take a look, see it?

304
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,240
Whoa, look at you all.

305
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Hey, you've been gone a while. Did you guys do it?

306
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,720
How was it? Good?

307
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,680
Fuck off. I do whatever I want to do.

308
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Well, I just wanted to know, I didn't say I wanted to be part of it.

309
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Wait, or could I?

310
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,600
Just kidding!

311
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,800
Fuck off, ass.

312
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
What?

313
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,280
Hey, where's Por?

314
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,280
He said he's gonna go find you all. Didn't you see him?

315
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Nope.

316
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,800
Or was he eaten by a tiger already?

317
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,000
A tiger? Here?

318
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,120
Or it could be a bear. Bears are ferocious too. I saw them in the video.

319
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
That's enough. You are wasted.

320
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,160
But it's possible.

321
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,960
We're in the woods.

322
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,640
It's common to have wild animals out here.

323
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,160
That's right.

324
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,640
Wait, there are CCTVs here, right? I remember.

325
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,520
I think we should go find him, shall we?

326
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,200
Hey, not that.

327
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,000
You guys did it so explicitly. You don't need to be embarrassed.

328
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,920
Phee, hurry up and change. My little one will cry now.

329
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,440
Alright, I'll change.

330
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Hey, what?

331
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
This is better.

332
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,040
There. That's Por. See that?

333
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Where did he go?

334
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,880
Where could he be?

335
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Why did he behave so strange and why would he go into the woods alone?

336
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Por. Por. Por. Por. Por. Por.

337
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Por, where are you? Por. Por!

338
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,640
I think we should split up.

339
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,080
Alright.

340
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,920
You three, go that way.

341
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,360
We'll go this way.

342
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,560
Okay?

343
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Por!

344
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,400
Por! Can you hear me?

345
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Por!

346
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Por, can you hear me, Por?

347
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Por!

348
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,720
Ah!

349
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Hey, that's Por. Hurry up!

350
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,920
Por!

351
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Hey, Por!

352
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,840
Man, Por, is he dead yet?

353
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,880
No.

354
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,480
Don't, don't you move Por.

355
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,440
If he bleeds more, he'll definitely die.

356
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,920
And what would you want us to do? Let him die?

357
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,760
Tee, what the hell are yelling for?

358
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,920
Fluke, you're gonna be a doctor, right? Help Por.

359
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,120
I think we should find something to cut this branch off first.

360
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,200
Okay, then Tee and Top,...

361
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,440
you two are good drivers. Go find help.

362
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Tan, White, you two, off to the home phone in case we get help sooner.

363
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,560
Fluke, you stay with Por, do not let him die.

364
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,440
Jin and I will go find something to cut this freakin' branch.

365
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,880
Shit.

366
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Hey, asses, I'm only studying in my second year. I haven't even started any lessons yet.

367
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,200
Shit, why does it always have to be me? Where the hell should I start?

368
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,840
Shit, shit, shit!

369
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,880
Hey, hurry up.

370
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,840
Don't you die, Por.

371
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,960
Man, where's the key?

372
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,760
No.

373
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,440
Found it.

374
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
C'mon, man.

375
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Shit.

376
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,440
Shit, it won't start.

377
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
We still have the gas. Wait here, I'll be back.

378
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,840
Tee.

379
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,000
Open the hood.

380
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay.

381
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
How's it?

382
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Try again.

383
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Okay.

384
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
I think it's too old.

385
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,400
Top, help me find jumper cables.

386
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,800
Alright, alright.

387
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Hurry up!

388
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
Wait for me, Tee.

389
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Found it, Top.

390
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
Shit.

391
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,640
C'mon, hurry.

392
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Coming.

393
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,160
Will that work, Tee?

394
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Try starting the car again, now!

395
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Go!

396
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,360
Shit, nevermind.

397
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,040
Top, we'll use this.

398
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,120
Huh?

399
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
We're using this! Hurry!

400
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
You! Hop on.

401
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,240
I'll push.

402
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Go ahead!

403
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Hit it!

404
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,360
On it!

405
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Alright, here we go.

406
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,400
Go! Go!

407
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,720
Damn.

408
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,080
Man, does it work?

409
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,680
Yeah.

410
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
C'mon, hurry.

411
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,960
Shit, the road is messed up.

412
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
And this motorbike is so damn old, shit.

413
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,320
There's no sound.

414
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
I think it's so old that the rats bit the line off.

415
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
What should we do next?

416
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,160
I have an idea. Follow me.

417
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
White, look over there. I'll look over here.

418
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
Hey, Tan!

419
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,159
Found it.

420
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Go ahead.

421
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,199
Charger.

422
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,719
It's good that you study Computer Engineering.

423
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,600
Because I don't know a damn thing about this.

424
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I haven't done anything yet. I just charged it.

425
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Oh, normally, I just turn it on and off.

426
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,360
I think it should work now.

427
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Turn it on.

428
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Hello MODE.

429
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,720
1 to 2, this is the valley mansion, over.

430
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
This is valley mansion. Do you copy? Over.

431
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Okay.

432
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,240
I think there should be something sharp enough to cut the branch.

433
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Phee.

434
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Hey, easy, easy, you ass.

435
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Ass, I'm doing my best here. It's the motorbike.

436
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Damn it.

437
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Shit.

438
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,200
I think we stepped on something.

439
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,320
What now?

440
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Damn it, we won't make it.

441
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,680
Then I think we should head back to the house first.

442
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,560
In case White and Tan can reach outsiders.

443
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
We need someone to change the tires too.

444
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Alright, help me push this.

445
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Shit!

446
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,440
What? What the hell is wrong with you?

447
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,720
You're a grown up now. What are you so afraid of?

448
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm not afraid.

449
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,800
It's just...

450
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,400
I saw something there.

451
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
And there's a creepy noise.

452
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,520
You're delusional. Stop it. There's nothing.

453
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Tee, can you push it for me? I just can't...

454
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
What the hell?

455
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Ah.

456
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,280
Tan, come help me.

457
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Wait, wait, wait.

458
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,080
Okay, now.

459
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,400
Lay him down gently.

460
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Guys, easy.

461
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,920
Let him lay on my lap.

462
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,120
What are these fucking marks on his arms?

463
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,120
I've seen these marks before. They are cuts from the knife.

464
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,040
It's no accident. This is a murder attempt.

465
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,960
Por, can you hear me, Por?

466
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,440
Fluke, can you not do something else?

467
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, we got no tools at all now.

468
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,160
All I can do is stop the bleeding to buy him some time.

469
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
How long can you buy him time?

470
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,920
If he doesn't get out of here soon...

471
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
he won't make it.

472
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Right now, all we can hope for is that Tee and Top will find help in time.

473
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,720
Tee's been gone for so long. He hasn't returned yet.

474
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,720
He will soon. He went with Top. There won't be a problem.

475
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Fluke, what now?

476
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,720
Damn you, why do you keep asking me that?

477
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Don't you all know what to do?

478
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Well, let's get him inside the house first.

479
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,840
White, come here! What are you doing standing there?

480
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Okay, let's go. One, two...

481
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,080
Shit.

482
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,720
What now?

483
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Didn't you hear that? I really heard something. There's someone out there.

484
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,880
No, I did not hear a thing.

485
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Whoa, shit.

486
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,480
Shit, Tee, wait for me.

487
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,160
Damn it!

488
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Damn you, why would you pull...

489
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Tee, Tee...

490
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,640
Tee...

491
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Tee, you're seeing what I saw, aren't you?

492
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Tee, shithead, I'm about to cry now.

493
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Don't ask.

494
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,920
Drag me out of here, now.

495
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Alright, go, go, go.

496
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Damn it, the motorbike.

497
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Shit.

498
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,440
Let's go, what are you waiting for?

499
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Hurry up, go!

500
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
What do you mean, it won't work?

501
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,040
It's a long-distance walkie talkie, isn't it?

502
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,200
I guess it's not that long of a distance.

503
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,040
I'll try to boost the signal.

504
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Maybe we'll be able to talk to people who are far away.

505
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,920
There's someone hunting us.

506
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Top and I really saw him. There's someone else other than us here.

507
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,680
How is that possible?

508
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,360
There are eight of us.

509
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,440
Por said aside from us, there weren't any other people.

510
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,440
If there's no one else, then who hurt Por?

511
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,960
I think there's....something else that attacked Por.

512
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,920
You're saying that the 9th person is a murderer and is in this house?

513
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,040
I don't think it's a person.

514
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
I think it's Non Ghost.

515
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,040
Wait, why would this involve a guy named Non?

516
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Right, I'm getting confused here, about the guy named Non.

517
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,040
Don't listen to Top. He talks rubbish.

518
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,040
Non is alive. He just doesn't talk to us.

519
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,760
Hey, and why can't it be like what Top said?

520
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Aside from us, there's only Non who came to this house.

521
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,560
That's crazy. What ghost would hold a knife to kill a human?

522
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
This is a man's doing.

523
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,760
No, this is Non Ghost's doing.

524
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,640
Because we continued filming the story that he wrote, it's cursed.

525
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,520
And he's now killing each one of us.

526
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,400
I don't know what the hell you guys went through.

527
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,400
But if we want to know more about the 9th person...if he's a murderer, a thief or a ghost,...

528
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
then we gotta to prove it.

529
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,680
If Por doesn't get medical treatment soon,

530
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,280
I give it two days, max.

531
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,600
If you don't think it's a curse then it's up to you.

532
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,080
If something happens again, don't say I didn't warn you.

533
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,120
Don't!

534
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Ah!

535
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,960
You thought so, right?

536
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
That you're gonna be next.

537
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
Tell him where you guys have been.

538
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,720
Man, where have you all gone?

539
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Phee, Jin is here.

540
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Tee, White, damn!

541
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Tee, you're doing it outdoor? What if my Dad takes a look at the footage?

542
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,560
Who's that?

543
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

544
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Shit.

545
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
What? He's gone.

546
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Shit.

547
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,760
Ah.

548
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Keep rolling.

549
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,560
Put more blood on the branch.

550
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,160
Good?

551
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,440
It's a fingerprint.

552
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,600
One sec. How about his mouth?

553
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,960
Okay, got it. The mouth looks great.

554
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,440
Enough?

555
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,640
Yes, get out.

556
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,240
I'll tilt up after "action."

557
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,720
Okay, keep rolling. Camera.

558
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,720
And action!

559
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:43,520
Ah. Ah.

560
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Cut!

561
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
Shit.

562
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,040
Top, we'll use this.

563
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,880
Huh?

564
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,880
We'll use this, c'mon.

565
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,080
Hop on.

566
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Wait, get off, I'll start the engine.

567
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,480
And does it work? Fool! I'll push. Hurry!

568
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
C'mon.

569
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,240
Start.

570
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,360
Right.

571
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,880
C'mon.

572
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,640
Hey, hey, shit.

573
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,840
One sec. Go!

574
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,960
Shit!

575
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,240
Shit! What the hell?

576
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
C'mon, let's go.

577
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
Start!

578
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Shit!

579
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,480
And action!

580
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,080
Hey, it's on, Tee!

581
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,800
Wait for me!

582
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,800
C'mon, let's go.

583
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Hell.

584
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,200
Tee, push again.

585
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,200
Okay, start!

586
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
It's on. / Shit!

587
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,000
Wait for me! / Hurry up!

588
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,760
What? Shit!

589
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Start!

590
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,600
C'mon. / Wait for me, shithead.

591
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,080
Go! / Man! / Damn it!

592
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,120
Get it?

593
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,400
Yeah.

594
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,400
C'mon.

595
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
And action!

596
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,920
Okay.

597
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,800
Tee, smoke, over here.

598
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
C'mon, let's do it.

599
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Okay.

600
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,640
I go first. / Yes.

601
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,880
Okay, ready.

602
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,360
Speed and action!

603
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Are you alright?

604
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Cut!

605
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,280
Hey, hey! Wait, why did you say cut? Who's in the way for the star to shine?

606
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,520
I'm about to shine, man.

607
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,520
What the hell is wrong with you?

608
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,240
I'm sorry.

609
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,400
You got problems...

610
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Was that personal?

611
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,560
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
