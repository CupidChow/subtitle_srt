2
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,000
You must punish the ones who hurt Non.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
And you'll be safe.

4
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
What the hell were you two thinking?

5
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,920
Tan and New are the same person.

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
He's Non's brother.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,760
He wants a revenge.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,320
Hey, shit!

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,120
Who hurt Non...

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,920
The reason Non disappeared was because of me. It's my fault.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,720
What else did you do? Tell me all about it!

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Tell me!

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
This way, sir.

15
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,039
Are you sending him away tonight?

16
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,039
Yes, tonight, sir.

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Make sure the price they give us is good.
They always bargain.

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,479
He doesn't look so good.

19
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
But he's still young.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,200
He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. He's sellable.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,720
Liver. Kidneys. Heart. Lungs.

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,680
Don't screw this up.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
If you do, I'll sell you instead.

24
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Alright.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
It's me.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Tee. Why are you here?

27
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,760
Are you gonna sell Non?

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
But that's not what we agreed.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,800
This is not different from killing him.

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,079
You can't do this.

31
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,160
He's in debt. He needs to pay for it.
No exception.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,560
Just leave already.
Seeing you annoys me.

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,280
He is my friend, Uncle!

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Go!

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,240
You said you wouldn't kill him.
Don't break your promise, Uncle.

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,800
You can make me work however you like.
I'm up for that.

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
But please don't kill him.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,720
What's wrong with you, Tee?

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
I've lost the money.

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,520
I was in trouble because of the news he exposed.
What do you want me to do?

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,520
There must be someone responsible for what I lost.

42
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,760
You can let him do something for you.

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,040
You can have him take care of the casino or the horse accounts.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Or you can have him serve you without having to pay him.
Isn't that good, Uncle?

45
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, we are in trouble now because he messed up.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
Just give him a chance, Uncle.

47
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,480
I guarantee you that he won't slip this time.
I'll keep an eye on him.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Twice the amount for his organs
only covers the interest, not the principal.

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,760
You want it or not?!

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,280
If not, I'll sell him.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,240
Alright. I'll make Non pay you back
both the principal and interest.

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,440
Are you gonna let him go?

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Do I look like a fool?
He only has a small debt.

54
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Let him work at the casino till he dies.

55
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
That way, it is safer.

56
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,520
There's a first aid kit in the box.

57
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
You know how to do it, right?

58
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Why did you do this to me?

59
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:59,159
You drugged me.
You sent me to your Uncle.

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,320
You sent me here to die.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Why are you helping me now?

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,560
I didn't send you here to die.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
My Uncle told me that he'd help you find the rest of the money.

64
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,160
So I brought you here.

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Who would think that he's going to sell your organs?

66
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,400
You guys blamed me for the broken camera.

67
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,200
You pulled me in here to work for your Uncle.

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,160
And look at this...

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Why?

70
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,640
Why? Why do I have to pay for what I didn't do?

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,440
Non.

72
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,400
You called me Greasy. I was fine with that.

73
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,440
You fooled me to open the horse accounts.
I was alright with that.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,680
Even about the broken camera...

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,440
I was still putting up with it.

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Why? Just because you didn't want to be friends with me,

77
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,640
you had to do all this to me?

78
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,200
Because I'm just different from others?

79
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,520
Why is what I do always wrong?

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,480
Everything about me is always shitty.

81
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,000
Non.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I never thought that it would get this far.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,600
It's alright. You know that I'm good at this, right?

84
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,040
I've worked for my Uncle for a really long time.

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,400
I won't let you die.

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,280
I'll help you find the money to pay him back.

87
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
That's because all of this is your fault.

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,800
You're supposed to be the one helping me from the beginning.

89
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,560
Why, Tee?

90
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I just want to finish the movie.

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,880
If you didn't see me as your friend,

92
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,240
I could move to another school.

93
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Why did you have to be so mean to me? Why?

94
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,760
Don't be upset now.

95
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,760
You'll be more hurt.

96
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:36,159
My Uncle lets you stay here for now, so you can work as hard as you can.

97
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,159
I think it's a good idea.

98
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,159
If you family sees you now...

99
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Even if they see me like this,

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,320
they wouldn't care.

101
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,280
They would think that I caused some trouble.

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,920
That I was a loser.

103
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,920
They would only care about my brother who's studying abroad now.

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Non.

105
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
When you pay off your debt, you can go home.

106
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Oh, so you gotta work every day now, huh?

108
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I thought the beloved nephew of the boss can do anything, anywhere.

109
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,520
So? Do I have to report to you what I do each day now?

110
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
No matter where I do my work, it's all shitty.

111
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,800
Hey, this kind of work gives you the roof over your head.

112
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
And you can live a normal life.

113
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,400
Don't say bad things to my work ethics.

114
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Hello.

115
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,200
I'm about to go home from my part-time job.

116
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh, okay, okay.

117
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,320
Boss told me that you must finish transfering the money
and hurry back to work at the casino.

118
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Alright, thanks.

119
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,560
Hey, what are you doing?

120
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
Get up!

121
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm losing my hand now!

122
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Calm down, bro. He's new.

123
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
I'll give you extra chips for free.

124
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,440
And the drinks are on the house.

125
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,320
Calm down, calm down.

126
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Annoying!

127
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Get to that table.

128
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
So during this time, you gotta take care of this kid this much?

129
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,560
You give away free chips and drinks.

130
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,680
What if Suriyen deducts your money?

131
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Just let him do what he gotta do.

132
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,920
I can't do shit.

133
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
You seem like you have a secret. Huh?

134
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Is he that important?

135
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
You like him?

136
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,720
That's nuts.

137
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
What?

138
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,000
He's a friend in my group.

139
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't want him to die.

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,960
I don't want any problems with the group.

141
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,720
What? You call him a friend?

142
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
You're the one who put him in this shithole.

143
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,320
You already knew, right?

144
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
And why are you being...sad or whatever...like this.

145
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I don't get it.

146
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
Alright, alright, I'm not gonna do the talk anymore.

147
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
I'll help you work for...one more hour...

148
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
so you won't get deducted, okay?

149
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Thanks.

150
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Have you never felt guilty about what you do?

151
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,520
Well...what good will that make?

152
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,240
This kind of place, once you get in, you just can't get out.

153
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,240
And if I have to be troubled...to help others...

154
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,280
I think I'd choose myself.

155
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Wouldn't you choose yourself?

156
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I'll be right back.

157
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Would you like me to refill it?

158
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,160
So you really don't know where Non has gone?

159
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,800
We really don't know about that.

160
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
We couldn't reach him too.

161
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
I called his house too.

162
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,200
And I couldn't reach his parents or anyone.

163
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,320
He's been absent a lot.

164
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
It will affact his exams into the university.

165
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,160
How about your friend, Tee? Where is he?

166
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
Is he absent too?

167
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Both Tee and Non, I can't reach them.

168
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,320
Can you try reaching them for me?

169
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
This is not good for them for the upcoming exams.

171
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,040
How long will we have to answer other people about Greasy?

172
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,240
He just fucking disappeared like this.

173
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
I got a bad feeling about this.

174
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
What if someone knows that Tee drugged Greasy,

175
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,480
what should we do?

176
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,760
We just don't talk about Greasy.

177
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,960
If we don't talk, no one will know.

178
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,960
Trust Tee. If he says there's nothing
to worry about, then it's nothing.

179
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,080
I think Greasy will come back to school.

180
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,880
What matters is when he's going come back.

181
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,040
Yes.

182
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Please, come in.

183
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Yes?

184
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I heard you're hiring. I'm here to apply.

185
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,280
You don't have school?

186
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
Well, it's alright. I'm finding a man.

187
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,280
Come sit over here.

188
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, there's not much work.

189
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,160
There's a queue card with number, right?
You just fill in the computer.

190
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,640
And the snacks, there are numbers labled.

191
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
But you, you can't wear that to work.

192
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
You gotta go change.

193
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Is there anything else you don't understand?

194
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,720
10 more seconds.

195
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
5

196
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,920
4

197
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,400
3

198
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,440
2

199
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,600
Warp, warp, warp.

200
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,880
There he is. Upper right.

201
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,240
Where, dumbass?

202
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Hurry. Find him. He's warped again.

203
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, you got this one?

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,080
Are you interested?

205
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,160
Yes, how much?

206
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:31,800
How much?

207
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,520
5,000. You want it?

208
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Yes, of course!

209
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Transfered.

210
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,720
You got more?

211
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Yes, yes.

212
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Alright, choose.

213
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Where did you get this?

214
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Don't ask.

215
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Just give it to my Uncle.

216
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,400
Hey.

217
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,920
When I told you that I was going to help, I meant it.

218
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
So you can get out of here fast.

219
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,680
You're supposed to help me anyway.

220
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Hey!

221
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Hey!

222
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Dad!

223
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Dad!

224
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Fuck!

225
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,280
What the hell are you doing? Damn!

226
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,840
That's for sale. You can't do that.

227
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,160
You, pay me the rest.

228
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,360
Hey, I got nothing to pay you.

229
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,920
You tell that bitch to pay me back.

230
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,320
Pay me now!

231
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Dad!

232
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Dad, where are you?

233
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,480
You crazy! Go home!

234
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,480
Look what you did here.
My stuff is ruined.

235
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,760
I'll...I'll let the demon eat you alive.

236
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,480
Well, let it try.

237
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,440
Dad!

238
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,320
I do my job, and you mess with me everyday.

239
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,240
You don't give it back.

240
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Yeah, yeah, let it eat me!

241
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,040
Dad!

242
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Let go!

243
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,800
What? Let me go!

244
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,280
I'm sorry, I'll take my Dad away now.

245
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,880
If he gets like this, you should lock him in the house.

246
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,240
And who will be responsible for this?

247
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,800
I will, I will.

248
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,680
I'm so sorry. Right now, I don't have any money.

249
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,960
Take him away, or I'll call the police.

250
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,560
Just bill me, and I'll clear it later.

251
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,480
Alright, hurry up and do that.

252
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,880
And lock your Dad away.

253
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
He causes me troubles every day.

254
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
You get off me!

255
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,200
Let me go! I'll get my land back.

256
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
That's enough, Dad.

257
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,800
I'll get my land back!

258
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Get in the house!

259
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,320
Let me go!

260
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,560
I want my land back!

261
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,880
I want my land.

262
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,760
Dad!

263
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,120
Kill them all!

264
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,160
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

265
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,160
Can you hear me, Dad?

266
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,280
Dad, Dad!

267
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,520
When are you gonna stop?

268
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,320
When are you gonna wake up?

269
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
I can't be your Dad, Dad!

270
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
It should be you who take care of me.

271
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Dad, I really can't do this anymore.

272
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't wanna live like this.

273
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,280
I wanna be a normal kid.

274
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
I wanna study. I wanna have good friends.

275
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,520
I don't wanna get involed with this fucking gray business.

276
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,520
I don't wanna...I don't wanna know what shit I've done.

277
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,200
You have gray hair already.

278
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,520
Gray hair.

279
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,440
Here's another one.

280
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Like mine.

281
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Like mine.

282
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
You're old.

283
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
There, it went there already.

284
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You have some bananas today, alright?

285
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,280
And tomorrow, I'll buy you some new food.

286
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Don't run away again.

287
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Bananas. That's good. Move, move.

288
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,240
Bananas for the monk so I can get the land back.

289
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,200
May I have my land back.

290
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,200
May I have my land back. Let's pray.

291
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,720
Now, we have a lead pointing to the possibility

292
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
that the boy might run away with the tutor as seen in the video.

293
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,000
What is your opinion, Mr. Ekkachai and Mrs. Nujira,

294
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
on the student, who is in the same group with Mr. Por,
involving the horse accounts?

295
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,760
We don't have any comments on that matter.

296
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,960
Personally, it's about how a teenager...

297
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,960
was raised by his family.

298
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,440
They had an interview right at Por's place.

299
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,040
I think this is getting out of control.

300
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,960
Right, I know that. But don't you worry.

301
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,480
You're not worried, but I am worried.

302
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,960
Has Non paid off his debt?

303
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,960
I've been waiting for too long...too long that I think that he's...

304
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Alright, guys, take a look.

305
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,240
My Uncle just sent me this.

306
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,080
Mr. Keng came and got Non out already.

307
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,600
Non really ran away with Mr. Keng.

308
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,520
Hey, is that true?

309
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,360
They ran away together, not coming back?

310
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,320
Just like that?

311
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,320
Yeah, or do you want him to be with you?

312
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,680
Now, you guys should stop worrying about him.

313
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,680
If Non is ready, he'll come back.

314
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Non...

315
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,600
must really love Mr. Keng.

316
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
But I understand him.

317
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
That video is scandalous.

318
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
If he'd come back to school right after that, it must be hard for him.

319
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,080
And that video is spreading all over the internet.

320
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,080
If I were him, I would move to another school,
or even move to another house.

321
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,200
If it'd make things better.

322
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Lastly, love can destroy one's life.

323
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,040
If we didn't put pressure on him about the camera in the first place,

324
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,080
things like this wouldn't have happened.

325
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,680
Stop it!

326
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Well, it all started with me, but we are all guilty.

327
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,280
The short movie, we made it altogether.

328
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,760
So why are you blaming it on me alone?

329
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,760
If you wanna blame it on someone, blame it on Mr. Keng.

330
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,840
He's a tutor...and he fooled his student.

331
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
He's fucking evil.

332
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,280
Hey, Tee, are you leaving now?

333
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,080
You're not here for the next class?

334
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Right, I've been doing lots of part-time jobs lately.

335
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,840
If you don't see me in any classes, just cover up for me.

336
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,080
My Dad is in need for money right now.

337
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
Alright, alright.

338
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,320
Did Non come to work today?

339
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I don't know.

340
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,720
Tee.

341
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Huh?

342
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Is your friend upstairs?

343
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,520
I heard Suriyen orderd his man to go to that boy's room,

344
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
saying to take him away.

345
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,200
So that's an order to kill your friend, isn't it?

346
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Shit!

347
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
What happened?

348
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
I asked what the hell happened.

349
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
What happened to him? Huh?

350
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,280
Answer! What the fuck happened to him?

351
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Hey!

352
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,840
He worked too hard that he's dead.
I should be the one who's complaining here.

353
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
If I'd sold him, I would've made more money
than the tiny bit he worked for me.

354
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,920
I haven't even got my money and now he's dead.

355
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,240
I really want to know...

356
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,800
you helping him earn money all day and night,

357
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
does that really change anything?

358
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,880
At last, it's all the same.

359
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,400
I didn't want him to die!

360
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
But it happened!

361
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,960
You're lucky that you're my nephew.

362
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,640
He's just a boy.

363
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Right now, just find me someone else to pay the debt.

364
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,440
Uncle, are you really human?

365
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,280
Someone just died.

366
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,960
And you're asking for another guy to work for you?

367
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,720
I never forced you to work for me.

368
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
You were the one who asked for work.

369
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,000
So you can take care of your crazy Dad.

370
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,080
If you want to be a good guy here, don't work with me.

371
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,080
I really want to know...if your good deeds can help your Dad.

372
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Hey.

373
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Hey, you're early today!

374
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Man, you look like shit.

375
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,520
What did you do?

376
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,160
Now, the news about Non is all around.

377
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Fluke, what's the problem?

378
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
Take a look here.

379
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,440
The news reporter made a conclusion like what you told me.

380
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,480
Right now, it's even on the local news.

381
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Someone asked me about it.
All I did was showing the pic Tee had shown us.

382
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,240
And...stuff just spread all over.

383
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,200
But isn't that a good thing?

384
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,120
So people would stop asking where Non's gone.

385
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,920
Fuck! This is fucked up!

386
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Nothing is fucking good.

387
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Shit, Tee, is he on his period?
He got mood swings.

388
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I don't know too.
I've never seen him like this too.

389
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Alright, whatever.
If something comes up, he'll tell us.

390
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,680
"I'm gonna get out of this place. I'm not a loser."

391
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
It's because of his innocence, he believed in adults' words.

392
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,840
It's because of shittiness that I couldn't save Non.

393
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,720
So I think that a guy like me doesn't deserve to be happy.

394
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
For one, please.

395
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,600
What are you doing? Smoking pot?

396
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Can I try?

397
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
You're just a kid.
Don't try this kind of stuff, it's not good. Get lost.

398
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,440
If it's not good, why are you smoking it?

399
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
Why don't you quit?

400
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
You talk so much.

401
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
It's snack time.

402
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,760
Hey.

403
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
I'm here everyday because of you.

404
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
But I've never seen you smile to anyone.

405
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,040
You never smile even when you smoke pot.

406
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,480
So why are you doing it?

407
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,080
Don't mess with me. Just go already.

408
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Some people deserve to be by themselves.

409
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Are you asking me for pot?

410
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,880
I believe that no one in this world deserves to be alone.

411
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,920
If you have a problem, just solve it.

412
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
So you're just thinking about that in your head?

413
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
A candy?

414
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,280
What?

415
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
You want it?

416
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
It's good.

417
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
But not as good as this.

418
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Give me that.

419
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
Fuck, the teacher!

420
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
Are you smoking marijuana?

421
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What school are you in?

422
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Move over.

423
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
He's gone.

424
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,760
We're almost screwed.

425
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Good thing that the candy isn't stuck in my throat.

426
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
We stink now.

427
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
You stink of weed.

428
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
If we see people who know us, we'll get in trouble.

429
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Here, I'm returning your shirt.

430
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I had to wash it myself or else my Mom would scold me.

431
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Let me take a look.

432
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Look.

433
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Damn, are you being a smartass here?

434
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
No, I'm not being a smartass.

435
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
My parents are engineers.

436
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,720
I got these books at my house.

437
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
If you're free, tutor me.

438
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Really?

439
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
Do you really want me to tutor you?

440
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Yes.

441
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,960
In exchange for...

442
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
You're good.

443
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Here, this is for you.

444
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,080
You can get in Faculty of Engineering easily with this score.

445
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,040
But that means...you're leaving me for uni.

446
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
And it's like two more years before I can follow you.

447
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,520
It's fine, I think.

448
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
It's not fine.

449
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
It is fine.

450
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Because I'll be waiting.

451
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Since I've met White, I started knowing what happiness is.

452
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,360
I started having my goal.

453
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,720
Wanting to start over.

454
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
I wanted to become a better person.

455
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Why haven't you ever told me about this?

456
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because it's been a while.

457
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Are you sure that you're not the one who killed Non?

458
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
I didn't do it.

459
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
I never planned to.

460
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Right now, I'm confused.

461
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I don't know if I can trust you.

462
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,520
The past is the past.
Right now, I'm a new person, White.

463
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,040
Fluke, Fluke, Fluke!

464
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,040
I've changed to a better person since I met you that day, White.

465
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,560
White, you told me that everything could change.

466
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,160
Fluke.

467
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,560
And action! And action!

468
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
I will never become the person you never knew.

469
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,960
Fluke, Fluke!

470
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Hey!

471
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Give me the gun!

472
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,960
Let go!

473
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,760
Phee, calm down.

474
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,720
Stop being crazy!

475
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Phee, Phee, Phee.

476
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,040
Don't shoot me.

477
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,760
If you wanna shoot someone, shoot Tee.

478
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,720
Damn it.

479
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,840
He confessed everything.

480
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,480
I'm not involved.

481
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,960
Shoot him!

482
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Right, Phee, shoot him!

483
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Shoot!

484
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
This is the moment we've all been waiting for, Phee.

485
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,360
What are you waiting for?

486
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
This asshole must be shot.

487
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Shoot him!

488
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
Shoot!

489
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,680
When the time comes,

490
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
I'll make everyone responsible.

491
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
What are you waiting for?

492
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,200
Shoot!

493
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,120
Don't do it, Phee.

494
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,440
Shut the hell up!

495
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Shit, you'll get some too.

496
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,480
You all make me throw my future away.

497
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,080
Especially, you!

498
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,080
You messed with my brother.

499
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
He's dead because of you!

500
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,800
Phee and I had to come up with a fussy plan because of you all.

501
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,440
You're goddamn assholes!

502
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,560
So you two teamed up?

503
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,360
Phee is Non's ex-boyfriend.

504
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,040
I just wanna know the truth about Non.

505
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,640
The curse about the movie doesn't exist.

506
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,160
New just wanted you all to consume the hallucinogen.

507
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,560
So you'll all reveal everything about Non.

508
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
Why do I have to know all about this?

509
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,840
White, I'm sorry.

510
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,840
I didn't wanna come here in the first place, Tee.

511
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,480
These guys killed your boyfriend.

512
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,480
These assholes made Non die.

513
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Phee.

514
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
You don't want to be like New, do you?

515
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Don't you remember what you told me?

516
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
I just want to know the truth.

517
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I don't want to kill anyone.

518
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,520
I knew already.

519
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
A guy like you didn't really love my brother.

520
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,920
Just a few years later, and you got yourself a new partner.

521
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
You're a slut.

522
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,640
I'm really sad for Non.

523
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
I loved Non.

524
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
But New, this is getting out of control.

525
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
We had a deal that we'd do justice for Non.

526
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,280
Not drugging other people to kill each other.

527
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,280
You really think that this is what Non would want?

528
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,720
Who would care about that?

529
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,600
Right now, what I need is...

530
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
for these assholes to pay.

531
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Do you know what you all took away from me?

532
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,040
My brother's video was leaked.

533
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
A rumor said that he ran away with another guy and disappeared.

534
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
My Mom was scolded until she's dead.

535
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
My Dad hung himself.

536
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,840
I got nothing left.

537
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,680
But you gotta pick the right one, man.

538
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,680
The one with an X mark is the one with the extract.

539
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,760
I was right that I never trusted you.

540
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,680
I don't care about your fucking ethics.

541
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,240
I don't give a shit.

542
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,160
What you all deserve right now is...

543
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
I don't know about anything.

544
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,760
You all must pay for it.

545
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,840
You all must die.

546
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,280
Shit, Non!

547
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,480
Your video with that fucking tutor,

548
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480
it's totally Jin's doing. I didn't do it.

549
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
You're filthy, don't touch me.

550
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,200
Tee, why are you talking to me like that?

551
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,000
If I wasn't here, you would be happy, right?

552
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,200
I've never thought like that.

553
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,160
Really?

554
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,680
Non.

555
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Really?

556
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:02,560
Don't!
