00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,800
Hey, hey, hey!

3
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,040
Help me! Top! Top's gone...

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,040
Or is he trying to escape from something?

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Hey, Tee!

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Is this Non?

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Tee, where are you?
I played the video in the hard disk earlier.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Fluke walked in and saw.
Tee, come home, hurry. Fluke is really scary.

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Shit!

10
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,280
Tee, come home, hurry.

11
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,479
I played the video in the hard disk earlier.

12
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,479
Fluke walked in and saw.  He is really scary. Can you hurry home?

13
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Por! Por! Por!

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Fluke! Fluke! Come see Por now! Looks like he's having a seizure.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Move.

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,320
White, I told you to help me find the tools to sew Por's wound, didn't I?

17
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
And what are you waiting for? Get over here!

18
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
What are you going to sew his wound with, Fluke?

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Whatever that I can use.

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Just help me look for the tools.

21
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Is that okay? Normally, it has to be clean needle and thread.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
You, dumbass White, I asked you to help me find stuff not arguing with me!

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Even I didn't study medicine, but you gotta do fucking whatever you can.

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
But if you won't do shit, just let Por die already, you piece of shit!

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Damn it!

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Now, what the hell are you waiting for? Get over here!

27
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,440
Found it.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,440
White, how long have you had the gun? Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,079
Shit, or are you the murderer?

30
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,840
No..no, I...

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,680
You want to kill everyone, don't you?

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,760
I was just searching for a hard disk cord and I found a gun...so I kept it.

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I don't buy that.

34
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,960
You're trying to get rid of all of us. You got a goddamn gun!

35
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,640
And you played the video; although, we'd all agreed that we wouldn't watch it.

36
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,840
What's your fucking intention, exactly, White?

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,840
I don't mean to hurt anyone.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Pick it up. Pick it up! Do it now!

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Open it! Open!

40
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Fluke, could you please stop pointing the gun at me?

41
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,400
You, walk! Walk!

42
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
Keep walking!

43
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Put the thread in the needle hole.

44
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Hurry up!

45
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
Do you know how to fucking do it? It's not that hard.

46
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
I'm doing it right now.

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,040
Damn it!

48
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,560
I can't do it. Please stop pointing the gun at me first.

49
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
My hands are shaking. I can't do it.

50
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,280
Alright, I'm putting it away. Now, can you do it faster?

51
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Are you done?

52
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Can't you just do something quickly?

53
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,720
Can't we just stop the bleeding?

54
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Can you see the wood hanging out?

55
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,560
If Por dies, I'll fucking tell everyone that you're the one who makes him die.

56
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,920
You're so slow, damn it.

57
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,200
Por's survived now, right?

58
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,640
For a while.

59
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:42,640
The bleeding has stopped, but it's still bleeding in his abdominal cavity.

60
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Watch him for me. I'll go wash my hands first.

61
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Tee, can you hurry home? Fluke's got a gun and he's so scary.

62
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Phee, I can't breathe.

63
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,280
It's alright. You're safe with me.

64
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm scared. We won't suffocate to death here, will we?

65
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
Don't be scared. You got me.

66
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Jin, I have an idea.

67
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Jin, are you alright? Are you hurt?

68
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,120
My shoulder, I think it dislocated.

69
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Again?

70
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
One sec.

71
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Okay, I'll help you.

72
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,720
It's the best we can do for now. I'll take you to the doctor
when we get out of this place, alright?

73
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,360
So where do we go next?

74
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,360
We came from that way so we gotta go back the same way.

75
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Perhaps we'll find the way out and we can also find Tee and Tan.

76
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Okay, let's go, easy there.

77
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Who the hell is the masked murderer?
How could he be that mad and try to kill us like that?

78
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
You think I know who he is?

79
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You guys would know best. That's the ghost character
you guys wrote for the film, isn't it?

80
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
I didn't write it. Non did.

81
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,640
That masked murderer must be Non Ghost coming back for revenge.

82
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
What fucking ghost could lift you up like that?

83
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,800
And what fucking human being could lift me up like that?

84
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You seem to believe that he's a ghost.
It's like you believe that Non is already dead.

85
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,640
Could you stop asking stupid questions?

86
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,480
What good would it do?
Would it help you stay alive and get out of here?

87
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Shut up before I shut it with fist.

88
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Tan...Tee...

89
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Are Tan and Tee okay?

90
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Worry about yourself first.

91
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Whoa!

92
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Is that a body?

93
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Dry leaves?

94
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Phee, can you feel something?

95
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Feel what?

96
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
These are all dry leaves.

97
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Shit!

98
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Shit!

99
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Jin, Jin, what's wrong?

100
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,840
It's Mr. Keng! Mr. Keng! Didn't you see that?

101
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,000
Where?

102
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
There! Can't you see him?
He's standing in front of the door.

103
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Mr. Keng! There! It's Mr. Keng.

104
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Tan, are we lost?

105
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
How would I know?
You seemed confident, so I kept following you.

106
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,480
I think we're in the right direction.
But this woods, it's cursed. It won't let us out.

107
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Should we try that way?

108
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,520
Nah. We'll be more lost.

109
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,520
But it wouldn't hurt us if we try.
If we do get lost, we could always turn back.

110
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
If I can't go back and help White in time, I'll blame you for it.

111
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Tee, Tee! It's the house!

112
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Fluke.

113
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,520
Where are you keeping the gun?

114
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,520
In my pocket. Why are you asking?

115
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Nothing. I was just...asking.

116
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I don't understand why you all didn't want us see the video.

117
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Didn't you see how we were like in the video?

118
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,320
We were drunk, we did drugs, and you could see my face clearly.

119
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,560
If this leaks, how will my future of becoming a doctor turn out?

120
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
That's it?

121
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,240
One more thing. Who would want to see the video of a friend disappearing?

122
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
We all are sad, you know.

123
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Right, Fluke...I...

124
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,480
White, get some water for Por.

125
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Alright.

126
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Shit, blood.

127
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
That's Tee's uncle.

128
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Fluke, are you not looking after Por?
I'll...get some water for him.

129
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,640
White, you're sluggish.
That's why I gotta get the water myself.

130
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,520
And...what were you saying? Who's Tee's uncle?

131
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,320
There! That's Tee's partner, but you don't know Uncle Joe.

132
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So that means Tee doesn't really tell you about stuff.

133
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Tee!

134
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,000
Top, Top!

135
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,480
Where are others?

136
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,040
Top!

137
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Shit!

138
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,240
Lie him on his side.

139
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,640
Ewww.

140
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,080
And what should we do next?

141
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,880
Back off. I'll do it.

142
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,520
You, shithead, Top.

143
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
What the hell is wrong with you?

144
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Lift him!

145
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,160
White! Damn you, can't you just do it?

146
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Do you need Tee to help you?

147
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Then, you come help me on this side.

148
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,480
Ahhhh, shit.

149
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,840
Carry him, hurry up, Fluke.

150
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
White, use more force.

151
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,720
This fucker must have eaten a bull. He's so heavy.

152
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,680
Shit, do I need to take care of two sick people?

153
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Fuck, isn't that a shitload of work?

154
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
These two are fucking burdens.

155
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,800
Fluke, do you have any way to treat Top?

156
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,800
So, Top can tell us where others are.

157
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
White, get me a flashlight.

158
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Right away.

159
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,000
Three years ago...we...

160
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,400
We did that to him...

161
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
It's because of that...that's why Non...

162
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Here comes the flashlight.

163
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Here's flashlight.

164
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Give it to me.

165
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Put the pillow under his head.

166
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,440
Like this?

167
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Yes.

168
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
White, go outside with me.

169
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:37,720
Alright.

170
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
C'mon..

171
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Clay?

172
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Yeah, clay.

173
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,960
Dig deeper, right? And then you'll find some clay.

174
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,440
And then you get it out and then dry it.

175
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,320
I don't understand how it can help Top.

176
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,280
Well, until Top gets to the hospital gastric lavage tomorrow,

177
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
I must find a way to absorb the toxin as much as I can.

178
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
I'll mix dry clay with water and have Top drink it.

179
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,160
Will that work?

180
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Right now, any way will work, or else Top will die.

181
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,320
Okay. You're the doctor, so I should believe you.

182
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,640
No, I'm not a doctor yet. I watched Detective Conan.

183
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Oh?

184
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Stop being so skeptical. Just do as I say.

185
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Alright.

186
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Use this to dig, so your hands won't get dirty.

187
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Okay.

188
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Fluke, I think this clay won't get dry easily.

189
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,200
I think we have to wait for the morning sun in order to dry the clay.

190
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080
By that time, we'll be out of this place.

191
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
But it's better than doing nothing, isn't it?

192
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Tan, I'm worried. The masked murderer must get to the house by now.

193
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,120
Shit, Tee. Calm down.

194
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,720
How should I warn White?

195
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
Damn it. I've tried to fix it for so long.

196
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
Hello, White.

197
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,360
Hello, White! Hello, White! Can you hear me?

198
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,440
Hello, Tee. Tee, can you hear me, Tee? Over.

199
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,480
Yes.

200
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Tee, where are you? Hurry home.

201
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,000
White, listen. Right now, the murderer is heading home.

202
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,040
If there's a stranger, do not open.

203
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Right now, there's no one. Only Top came home.

204
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,080
Huh? But we couldn't find Top.

205
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,960
Fluke and I are trying to find a way to save him.

206
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,040
How did Top go home?

207
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,720
Top rode the motorbike home alone.

208
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Shit.

209
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,960
So that masked murderer is Top?

210
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Shit!

211
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Por!

212
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Don't come any closer, shithead Top!

213
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
I'll fucking shoot you.

214
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Fuck, what's wrong with it?

215
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Hey, hey!

216
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Let go!

217
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Fluke, look out!

218
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let go!

219
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
Hey, let go of me.

220
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Por.

221
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Shit, Por.

222
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Wake up, dumbass!

223
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Por! Wake up! Don't you die like this.

224
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Por!

225
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
Por's dead.

226
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Por!

227
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,600
Open the door, White.

228
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,400
Tee. Tee's here.

229
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,720
White, can you hear me, White?

230
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,160
Can you?

231
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Tee.

232
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,840
White! White! Can you hear me, White?

233
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
White, open the door for me, White!

234
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,400
White!

235
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Tee!

236
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
What happened? I heard a gunshot.

237
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Yeah, I was fighting with Top when the gun went off.

238
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Top suddenly went crazy.

239
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,440
And...and he killed Por.

240
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Is Por dead? How did he die?

241
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:39,160
That fucking Top, he pulled the wood out of Por's stomach, so Por bled to death.

242
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Fuck it!

243
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,320
Aren't you a doctor? Can you not help him? You study Medicine!

244
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Hey! No doctors nor shamans could have saved him, fucker.

245
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,360
Tee, Por is fucking dead.

246
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Aren't you listening, piece of shit?

247
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
We were gonna leave tomorrow.

248
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,320
And where the hell is Top?

249
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,080
He passed out in the living room.

250
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,080
If he's nuts like this, we must tie him up before he kills anyone else.

251
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,560
So we'll be safe before the ride gets here.

252
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Wait for the ride? The driver is fucking dead.

253
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,199
Tee!

254
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Hey, did we get in this way?

255
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes.

256
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,840
Hey, I heard a car. Could be the one that's coming to pick us up.

257
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,280
Let's go. We must hurry and get out of here, Phee.

258
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,160
Okay.

259
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,920
Or we will be left behind.

260
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Shit, it's locked.

261
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Go sit down.

262
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

263
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,480
Is there anything that will work?

264
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
I'm looking for it.

265
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
Shit!

266
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Por!

267
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,040
He's dead. Por. He's fucking dead.

268
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,880
How should we tell their parents and the police?

269
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:46,080
There are lots of dead people here, and we'll become suspects?

270
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,680
Well, Top is the killer!

271
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
No!

272
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
No!
If I become a suspect, my profile will be messed up.

273
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Fluke, can you forget about that for a sec?
The most important thing for now is us leaving this fucking place.

274
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,560
That's right, Fluke. I could be your witness.

275
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
No!

276
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I know you all so well. You're fuckers. You killed a person.

277
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,360
How fucked up you all are, I know it all!

278
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
What the fuck are you talking about, Fluke?

279
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Or is it not true, Tee?

280
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,240
I know the shit that you did.

281
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,480
The camera, the leaked video...I know it all.

282
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,600
Fuck you, Fluke.

283
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
What video, what camera? What else? You fucking tell me now.

284
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
C'mon, man, tell me.

285
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Shit!

286
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Tee, give me the walkie-talkie.

287
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Now!

288
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Kick it here!

289
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Fluke, why are you doing this?

290
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,360
If anyone says one more word, I'll fucking shoot you.

291
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I've tried so hard to become a doctor.

292
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,840
I want my Mom to be proud of me.

293
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,920
But my life can't be screwed because of you guys!

294
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Especially, you, shithead Tee.

295
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,280
Hello. The ride is on the way to pick you up.

296
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:19,280
The way is blocked by the collapsing bridge.
There may be a delay. Over.

297
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm Por's friend. Por says we'll be staying longer.

298
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,240
So when should I pick you up?

299
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I'll let Uncle Dang know again.

300
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,520
You're so selfish as always.

301
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,520
You're no different, Tee. You're so good, huh?

302
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Yes! It's all because of you!

303
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,440
You know so well what you did three years ago.

304
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Guys, there will be a short film contest.

305
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,880
The winner will get the budget to make a film that will be played in the festival.

306
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
Make it found footage.

307
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,840
So in the story...everyone will meet a murderer who wears a mask.

308
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,440
And we gotta find a way to survive from his hunt.

309
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,440
What is he talking about?

310
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,560
I think what Non said is really interesting.

311
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,560
If you think it's cool, get that greasy head to write the script for us.

312
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,200
Do you know how to fucking do it? It's not that hard.

313
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm doing it right now.

314
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
Hurry up! White!

315
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
You, dumbass White!

316
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Got it, got it.

317
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Hurry up! Fucker!

318
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Again, please.

319
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Why are you laughing?

320
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Why can't you do it, fucker?

321
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Just lie down.

322
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Lie down.

323
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
Hit it, hit it!

324
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
Which side?

325
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,920
So, which side?

326
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,600
Let Phee do it.

327
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Okay.

328
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,120
Suppose it falls down...

329
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,120
And...the last time, hit it real hard, okay?

330
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Cut!

331
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,520
Hey, what? Shit!

332
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,360
Lie him on his side first.

333
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,760
And what should we do next?

334
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,200
Back off. I'll do it.

335
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Come help me him...lift. Lift him. Let's get him inside.

336
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,840
Do you have water in your mouth, if you do, nod.

337
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,720
No.

338
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,520
Give it here, hurry!

339
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Oh my gosh!

340
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,000
You'll have to spit again when you're on his shoulder.

341
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, fuck.

342
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
White, did you really help?

343
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,880
Hey, White, lift!

344
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Is this a guy or a bull? So fucking heavy.

345
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
What the hell are you guys doing?

346
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,840
Hey, let go of me!

347
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Wrong side.

348
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
Shit, it's locked.

349
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Go sit down.

350
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

351
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,440
Cut!

352
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,360
Shit, we made it!

353
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,360
We made it!
