2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello, my name is Phee.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,040
Hello, my name is Tan.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,560
I will make all of those assholes tell the truth.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,440
The reason I did it was because I wanted to be a part of the team.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,440
I wanted to get closer to him, to gain his trust.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,720
Then, you tell me, so I can understand.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,000
The correct thing is...we're just friends.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,240
Dad, Dad...

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,880
I got nothing left in my life anymore.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,960
Help me die, Phee.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,240
Are you high again?

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Why did you propose a party and Por's place?

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,840
It's a good opportunity to use this.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,520
The one with an X mark is the one with the extract.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,400
Non.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,600
You gotta help me expose them!

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,200
But the one without an X is the antidote.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,040
This is not deadly, is it?

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
This won't kill them.

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
Hey, Tee, you don't have to do that.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
Calm down, man, calm down.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,520
The fuck with that!
He was gonna shoot me, fucking asshole.

24
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,520
If you can't do shit, shut the fuck up.

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Tee.

26
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,039
Don't scold Tan.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Tee, calm down.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,120
You promised me that you wouldn't be like this.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
You wouldn't be so testy.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Shouldn't we find a solution to all of this?

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
Sounds good?

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
That fucking mask!

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,240
Hey, Top!

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Phee!

35
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,000
So that means, Non's script that you sent me...

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,440
wasn't used in the shooting...

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
That's right.

38
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
I must know where Non had gone.

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,680
We have 2 new students.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,079
Hello.

41
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,920
What's your name again?

42
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
My name is Phee.

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm Tan.

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,960
Are you alright?

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
Thank you.

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,400
Hey, are you the ones who made the short movie, Janta?

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The plot is phenomenal.

48
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,000
Por: Where do you want it to happen? Pick.

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Tan: The one that you shot a movie. Phee and I have never been there.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,880
Why did you propose a party and Por's place?

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,120
It's a good opportunity to use this.

52
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,160
If you consume this extract, you'll have hallucination.

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,280
Simply put, it's like a truth serum.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,600
This is not deadly, is it?

55
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
This won't kill them.

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,120
And why didn't you stop it from the beginning?

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Why did you let it go on till they got drugged?

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,200
There's so much more that you don't understand.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,200
About Non, and Tan.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll give you one more chance.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
If you have anything to tell me, do it now.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,960
That day, when we arrived at Por's.

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Tan and I set up the cameras and sound recorders
before we started partying.

64
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
So we'd know what would happen each day.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,680
And when you were unpacking your stuff,

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Tan put the hallucination drug that he and I made...

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
in the drinks for you all.

68
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
So you'd have hallucination,

69
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,640
Are you ready?

70
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,640
and confess what had happened to Non three years ago.

71
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,920
Actually, it was supposed to end when everyone was drunk,

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,920
and he and I would find out the truth.

73
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:38,159
But I didn't realize that Tan wouldn't go with the plan.

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
And it's not only when we partied.

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,440
After that,

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,680
Don't...

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I kept drugging you.

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
It wasn't an accident that Por was injured by the trap.

79
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,120
I think it was Tan,

80
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,440
Who?

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,440
who led him that way.

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Tan's drug boosted fear in everyone's subconscious.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,120
Their inner fear

84
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,280
Fuck!

85
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
will be enhanced into something scarier.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Non!

87
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,360
You broke my camera!

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,400
It's a wrap!

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
We'll continue tomorrow.

90
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,440
If you want it, tell your Dad to come sue me.

91
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,520
Ahhhhhhh!

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,520
And about Uncle Dang, I've never thought that he can be so cruel.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
He might kill Uncle Dang to cut off any escape.

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And we would be stuck here.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Non and I just had some misunderstanding.

97
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,120
There's not much for you to know. It's been ages.

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
And I think it's him who drugged Top.

99
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,760
And Top was high and was trying to hunt us all down.

100
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,120
I think I led us to the right way.

101
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

102
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Tan, help me! Someone with an axe is trying to kill me!

103
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
Help me, hurry up! I don't wanna die!

104
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
Calm down.

105
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
No!

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,760
Top, Top!

107
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Can you hear me? Answer!

108
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,679
Top, Top!

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Top!

110
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Tan!

111
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Fuck, where am I?

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,520
I wanna get out of here. I don't wanna die.

113
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,600
You're injured. You should rest first.

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,440
No one's gonna hurt you, Top.

115
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,720
No. No, I must get out of here.

116
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Non. He's not gonna let me go for sure.

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,120
Let me go. I must get out of here!

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Calm down!

119
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,520
Calm down, man.

120
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,360
Non's not gonna hurt you

121
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
if you protect him.

122
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I must protect Non?

123
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
You must punish the ones who hurt Non.

124
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,200
And you'll be safe.

125
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Punish the ones who hurt Non...

126
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

127
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Punish the ones who hurt Non...

128
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

129
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

130
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,120
If you want it, tell your Dad to come sue me.

131
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Top.

133
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

134
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
I must punish the ones who hurt Non.

135
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Tan must want everyone to die here.

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And blame it on the group massacre of Janta.

137
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,120
Let's go.

138
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,120
And about the hard disk, he must purposely placed it there for White to see.

139
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Phee.

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Phee. Jin.

141
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Phee. Jin.

142
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Fuck, help me!

143
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,040
By the time I knew it was Tan's plan, I couldn't do anything anymore.

144
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
What happened to you?

145
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,360
Everything was worse than what I intended.

146
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I've never thought that Tan would get to this point.

147
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,080
What the hell were you two thinking?

148
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Are you gonna kill us all?

149
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Don't look at me that way.

150
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,280
If I knew that Tan was gonna...kill you,

151
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,280
I..I would never let you guys come here, ever.

152
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
You can be mad at me or hate me.

153
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
But I swear, I never intended to kill anyone.

154
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Tan is Non's broher, the one called New, right?

155
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Yes.

156
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,080
New came back from England.

157
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
And you're Non's boyfriend.

158
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Yes.

159
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,680
So both of you never saw us as friends?

160
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Well...New and I intended to be in your group to discover the truth.

161
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,560
I know that Non disppeared.

162
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,560
But I never know where he's gone to, or if he's still alive.

163
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,800
It's haunting me, you know.

164
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You don't understand.

165
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,680
And I did it...

166
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,960
because I felt guilty about Non

167
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,560
when I told him to go die.

168
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,360
You want me to forgive you, right?

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Then get lost, and die!

170
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
And he really got lost.

171
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
It's my fault.

172
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,280
Actually, I don't have the right to be mad at you.

173
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Because it's me who made everything worse.

174
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
What do you mean?

175
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
I...

176
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
I was the one who exposed Non's video.

177
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I was the one who took the video of Non and Mr. Keng.

178
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
And put it on the internet.

179
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,840
Back then, I really liked Non.

180
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,880
But he never said he liked me.

181
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Because I knew that he had a boyfriend.

182
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
And I could live with that.

183
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,040
But when I saw him...do it with Mr. Keng.

184
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,640
I got really mad.

185
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I got really lost and did that.

186
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,160
So...it's always been you?

187
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,280
It's all been you all along?

188
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Fuck.

189
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
So we both were the ones who hurt Non?

190
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Fuck.

191
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Hey.

192
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
This must be Tan's axe that he keeps as a spare.

193
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
But it's good.

194
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Don't do anything stupid.

195
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
If anyone has any problems, I will shoot you, fuckers.

196
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,640
Tee, you're only threathening them right?
You're not actually gonna do it, right?

197
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,160
I must do it if I have to.

198
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
So the walkie-talkie is no longer working, right?

199
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Someone broke it.

200
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,600
Fuck, he's suddenly acting strange.

201
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
Should I shoot you, asshole?

202
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Don't!

203
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Don't shoot me

204
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
if you don't want to be a murderer.

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,920
Everything that's happened in this house,

206
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,079
is exactly what happens in Non's script writing.

207
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,160
Look at Top now.

208
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,120
He's like being possessed by Janta.

209
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,120
But I think from Top's condition, it doesn't look like he's possessed.

210
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
It's like he was high.

211
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
How could he be high?
This is in the middle of the woods.

212
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,680
Well, there are mushrooms and herbs in the woods.

213
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,120
When you eat them, you'll have hallucination.

214
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
There's no such thing as hallucination!

215
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Fluke.

216
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Non.

217
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Non.

218
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Shit, this must be Non's doing.

219
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
This must really be Non's doing.

220
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,520
Non hurts us...

221
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,200
because we hurt him first.

222
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
We treated him like hell so many times.

223
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Die!

224
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I will punish the ones who hurt Non.

225
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
I will punish all of you.

226
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Die, you, fucking assholes.

227
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,680
I thought that way earlier was the way out.

228
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Shit, where the fuck are we now?

229
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
C'mon, this is better than before, isn't it?

230
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
Didn't we pass here already?

231
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
One sec.

232
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'll make a mark first.

233
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
So we'll know.

234
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Let's go.

235
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Take it easy.

236
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Easy there.

237
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
So where are we going next?

238
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
This way, I guess.

239
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
Let's go.

240
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,160
This is your mark, isn't it?

241
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
I don't think this is right.
Are we gonna be stuck here forever?

242
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,120
This Janta cult lives up to its name.

243
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Who comes in never gets out.

244
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,120
There must be a way out.

245
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Who's gonna be stuck here forever?
That's impossible.

246
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
C'mon.

247
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
This way.

248
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Alright, let's go.

249
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,760
You said we're gonna get out of here.

250
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I don't wanna die yet.

251
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Jin.

252
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I told you that I would be the one who would protect you.

253
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
So, I'll get you out of here.

254
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Right now, our friends are waiting for us to help them.

255
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
So, you must stay strong.

256
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Believe in me.

257
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Let's go.

258
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Okay.

259
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,720
Come.

260
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Maybe this is the way out.

261
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Alright, then let's go that way.

262
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,560
Die, you, fucking assholes.

263
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,040
Die, dumbasses!

264
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,080
Tee, stop it!

265
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Tee!

266
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Tee, you always told me...

267
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
that you wanted to be friends with these guys.

268
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Especially, Top.

269
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I never wanted you to hurt anyone.

270
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Can't we just get out of here?

271
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Fluke.

272
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
No one leaves this place.

273
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
We all will die here.

274
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,080
If you're scared of Top acting weird again, just knock him out.

275
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Tee, can you give the gun to me?

276
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,760
Tee, let White have the gun.
Top won't be able to get out anymore.

277
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Fluke.

278
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
What if he gets out?

279
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,360
Shut the fuck up, asshole.

280
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,200
Earlier, you were gonna kill us all.

281
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,560
And wasn't that because of your doing, Tee?

282
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
You made everything happen.

283
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
We're almost there.

284
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Jin, get up.

285
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,040
Are you alright?

286
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Yes.

287
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Let's go.

288
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Hey, where have you guys been?

289
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,640
Is everyone okay?

290
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
What the hell happened?

291
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,160
Take a fucking look!

292
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,440
One of us is already fucking dead!

293
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,240
And two went fucking crazy. Shit!

294
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,640
Por.

295
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Por.

296
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,920
Right now, what we can do is getting out of this house first.

297
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Really? And how long should we wait, Tan?

298
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Or should I call you New?

299
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Do you have anything to tell everyone?
Especially, about Non.

300
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
What the fuck are you talking about?

301
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I don't know Non.

302
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Stop it.

303
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I told him the truth.

304
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
What the fuck are you talking about?

305
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Who the fuck is New?

306
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Huh?

307
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Tan and New are the same person.

308
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,320
He's Non's brother.

309
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,320
He wants a revenge.

310
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,600
Hey, shit!

311
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,800
Don't, don't!

312
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Back off!

313
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,280
If you don't want your darling to die...

314
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,280
Back off! Every single one of you.

315
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Fluke, he's not a part of this.

316
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Think before you do something.

317
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Give me the gun.

318
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Do you think I'm stupid?

319
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
You teamed up with fucking Tan.

320
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,800
I won't believe anyone.

321
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,800
You can shoot me instead, but please let him go.
He has no part in any of this.

322
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
He's not supposed to experience this.
Let him go.

323
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,600
Then you confess about what you did to Non.

324
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Spit everything out!

325
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
Fluke.

326
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Fluke!

327
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Fluke.

328
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Fluke!

329
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Don't come any closer.

330
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Don't come any closer, Non.

331
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I never intended to do that.

332
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Non, don't come any closer.

333
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

334
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I didn’t want to be like you.

335
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm sorry.

336
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Who hurt Non...must die!

337
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
Shit, shit!

338
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,680
Help me!

339
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,240
Shut up!

340
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,440
Don't, don't, don't!

341
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Don't, what?

342
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Then you confess what the fuck you did to Non.

343
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,840
So this fucking curse will end.

344
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,840
Talk!

345
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
Alright, okay, I'll do it. I'll talk.

346
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
The reason Non disappeared was because of me.
It's my fault.

347
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,360
THREE YEARS EARLIER

348
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,640
Hey, hey.

349
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Shit.

350
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
I'll take it from here.

351
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Have the set ready and continue shooting.

352
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,680
Wait, wait, wait. Tell me where you're taking Non.

353
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,160
It's fine. He'll live. He just passed out.

354
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,920
I'll help him sort his debt.

355
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,040
Don't you want to help him?

356
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,520
Top, com help me.

357
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,040
Fuck, he's heavy.

358
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,360
Fuck it.

359
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,440
Lift him up.

360
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Fuck, my arm hurts.

361
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Are we gonna let him do that?

362
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,480
If you want stop him, go ahead.

363
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,400
Tee said he wanted to help.

364
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
I trusted him.

365
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,520
I have no part in this anyway.

366
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Come here.

367
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
What should we do with them next, Boss?

368
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,120
Take the interest from them.

369
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,280
He fucked us up.

370
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,440
Sell whatever you can sell with this body.

371
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,200
What if there's news about a missing boy?

372
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Just release the news about two of them missing together.

373
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,120
Can't you just come up with that?

374
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,840
Find a good way. Do not let this slip.

375
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Or else you all will have to pay for it.

376
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
What happened to Non after I'd brought him to you?

377
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,800
What's wrong with you?

378
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,120
You brought your friend to me.
And now you have a problem with me?

379
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,560
Take the money and leave.

380
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,520
Do you know where Non and Mr. Keng are?

381
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
I don't know.

382
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Are they still alive?

383
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Don't ask many questions.

384
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
I tried to find out about what happened to Non.
I really don't know.

385
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I'm sorry.

386
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,640
Tee, you piece of shit, I trusted you.

387
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,480
Non's family got fucked up
because they thought Non ran away with Mr. Keng.

388
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
You saw it with your own eyes.

389
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,040
If I had known...

390
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,040
If I had known more,
I would never have drugged Non and sent him away.

391
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,320
I was fooled by my uncle too.

392
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
The fuck with that!

393
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
You're playing the victim now?

394
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,480
How long you've worked for your uncle
in exchange for money, I know all about that.

395
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,320
You and Top fooled and used Non.

396
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Tee, did you really do all of that?

397
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
You were involved with all of this?

398
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,240
White, I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

399
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
What kind of person are you, really?

400
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,240
You started this so you gotta be responsible for it.

401
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Fluke.

402
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Jin.

403
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,520
You've always said that you don't want to be a murderer, right?

404
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I want to be a doctor. I can't get my hands dirty.

405
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
I told you, don't come any closer.

406
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
What I say means nothing to you all?

407
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Not in the past, not in the present.

408
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,840
You're the one who killed Non.

409
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,840
I'll sacrifice your life for Non.

410
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
I really did that to Non.

411
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
But I never wanted him to die.

412
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,280
What else did you do?
Tell me all about it!

413
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Tell me!

414
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,960
So you really don't know where Non has gone?

415
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,840
We really don't know about that.

416
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,560
We couldn't reach him too.

417
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,560
So during this time, you gotta take care of this kid this much?

418
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,920
If I say I'll help you, I will.

419
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
You'll get out of this place soon.

420
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
For one.

421
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
What are you waiting for?!

422
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,400
Shoot!

423
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,480
No one hurt…

424
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,280
Cut!

425
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Shit, your face!

426
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,080
I couldn't hold it!

427
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,960
Sorry, sorry.

428
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Cut!

429
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Back off!

430
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,720
Cut!

431
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
Messed up the script.

432
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,160
Was that alright?

433
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,360
Yeah.

434
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,000
Was it?

435
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,520
Did we do it?

436
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Ohhh…

437
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

438
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,720
That’s it!

439
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,640
Yeah!

440
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,280
But my acting was different from the first take.

441
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:40,880
Mine, too.

442
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,240
Same here.

443
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,360
We all did it differently.

444
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,440
I just wanna sit down in all of a sudden.

445
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
The blocking was not the same.

446
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,840
Find a good way. Do not let this slip.

447
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,960
Or else will you have to for pay it…

448
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
Oops, what did I just say?

449
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Cut!
