00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,000
(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(Episode 4 Pandora's Box)

3
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,813
Come to papa.

4
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,381
Is it just me

5
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:09,594
because it's like the universe
is conspiring for us to meet.

6
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,816
It felt so right.

7
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:22,762
Right?

8
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:27,274
I don't know anything about fate or destiny

9
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,253
but I'm happy that you
went to my restaurant.

10
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,688
And I'm glad that your date didn't show up.

11
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,850
You're bad.

12
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,655
But I do feel the same way.

13
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:47,936
So...

14
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:52,849
Should I thank him for not coming?

15
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,073
Why?

16
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:58,670
Do you feel the need to still talk to him?

17
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,740
Not really.

18
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,431
Can you tell me the reason of your absence?

19
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:25,295
I was actually dealing with the death
of my mother.

20
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,168
I'm sorry to hear that.

21
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,199
But...

22
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:43,442
I understand you.

23
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:44,924
Why?

24
00:05:45,037 --> 00:05:47,243
Did your mom also died recently?

25
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,444
No.

26
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,121
Actually, my wife.

27
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,603
I'm still getting used to her being gone.

28
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:02,842
But...

29
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,650
getting there.

30
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,728
Rich...

31
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,225
it's a process.

32
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:13,852
You can do it.

33
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,855
I know.

34
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,822
So...

35
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
What's the plan?

36
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,372
What's our plan?

37
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,693
Actually Rich...

38
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:49,530
I'm flying to Japan in a few hours.

39
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:52,520
What?

40
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:56,773
Does that mean

41
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,933
you're going to leave me already?

42
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,729
Lord...

43
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:08,246
Why are you like that?

44
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,206
Everything's good.

45
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,971
Everything's perfect.

46
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,542
You know what, Lord? Just take me already!

47
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,669
Since you don't want me to be happy.

48
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:21,582
I just really need to leave.

49
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Go ahead.

50
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,711
Go ahead and leave me!

51
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,751
Get out of my house!

52
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:28,171
Yes,

53
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,005
this is my house.

54
00:07:30,558 --> 00:07:33,351
This is my house because
I'm the one paying for everything!

55
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:36,807
This is my house because
I'm the one paying the electric bill,

56
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,231
I'm the one paying for everything!

57
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:39,310
Get out of my house

58
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,860
I don't need a parasite!

59
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:41,911
Hey!

60
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:43,792
What are you talking about?!

61
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:45,830
Hey! Snap out of it!

62
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:47,198
Are you okay?

63
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:48,520
My God...

64
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:49,963
Don't you know that scene?

65
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,107
What scene?

66
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,126
Maricel Soriano in Separada!

67
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:56,217
That movie was so good!

68
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:57,953
The lines were iconic!

69
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,457
You're crazy.

70
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,961
You should watch that.

71
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:03,300
It's a masterpiece.

72
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:14,814
But anyways,

73
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:16,809
go.

74
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,436
I don't have a choice anyway.

75
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:22,532
And...

76
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,432
I'm used to people leaving me.

77
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:27,482
Hey.

78
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:28,740
No, no, no...

79
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,603
On the contrary,

80
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,415
I was...

81
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:34,697
wondering if you wanted to

82
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,656
come with me?

83
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:40,018
Really?

84
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:40,840
Yes.

85
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,012
Really?

86
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,588
Yes, I don't want to be left hanging.
And I want to spend more time with you.

87
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:47,137
- Is that really true?
- Yes.

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,919
Oh my God! Is that really true?

89
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:49,917
You want to come?

90
00:08:50,425 --> 00:08:52,538
Actually, all my bags are packed.
I'm ready to go.

91
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,507
I also have my passport.
Come on, let's go!

92
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:58,053
Thank you.

93
00:08:58,307 --> 00:09:01,763
- I hope you're excited.
- Yes, I'm excited. Come on now, let's go...

94
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,388
Where have you been all my life?

95
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,076
Rihanna?

96
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,692
Fly to Japan!

97
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:27,485
Hi.

98
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:29,726
Hi.

99
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:32,781
Come in.

100
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:51,508
I know Greg will be mad at me
for what I'm doing now.

101
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,528
But I just need answers.

102
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:00,973
Yes,

103
00:11:03,718 --> 00:11:06,142
I still have feelings for Greg.

104
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,114
It shouldn't be a surprise since

105
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,409
we were engaged for a month.

106
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,617
Engaged?

107
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,092
Yes.

108
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,326
We were engaged.

109
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,541
Didn't Greg mention it?

110
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,469
Or even his dad, Rich?

111
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,869
They didn't mention anything.

112
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:34,860
And that Greg and I met just recently?

113
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:44,511
No.

114
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,145
Tupe.

115
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:11,211
Now, do you believe me?

116
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:14,588
Alex.

117
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,001
I think it's better for you to go.

118
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,135
- Please.
- Tupe.

119
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,300
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,061
I know that you didn't do anything wrong.

121
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,638
And I know that Greg loves you.

122
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:28,975
Alex?

123
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,802
What are you doing here?

124
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:33,644
Tupe,

125
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,890
what is happening here?

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,300
Tupe just called me.

127
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,947
He just wanted to talk.

128
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:41,024
Alex, please.

129
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,983
I'm talking to Tupe.

130
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,482
What is happening here?

131
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,031
Greg, I'm sorry.

132
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:49,651
I don't know what I have done.

133
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,959
What did you do?

134
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,516
Just tell me what is happening here!

135
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:55,433
I think I should go.

136
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:57,547
Alex,

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,307
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:05,346
I'm sorry, Tupe.

139
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:12,667
Tupe.

140
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:15,688
Greg, I'm sorry.

141
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,294
Sorry for what?

142
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:26,165
I thought I was the one to surprise you.

143
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,489
But I was the one surprised.

144
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,249
Tupe...

145
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,707
Don't you trust me?

146
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,140
Greg, I can explain.

147
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,403
Greg...

148
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:48,495
I know Alex won't come here uninvited.

149
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:50,142
Greg...

150
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,515
Who am I compared to Alex?

151
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:57,185
What we have compared
to an engagement ring?

152
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,417
Ring?

153
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,112
This ring?

154
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:05,148
This ring?!

155
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,245
Here!

156
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:12,657
Open that.

157
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:18,793
Greg...

158
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,338
I'm sorry...

159
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,809
- I'm sorry...
- Tupe! Leave me alone.

160
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:30,975
Just leave me alone.

161
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,958
Dad, Mrs. dela Cruz's papers are done.
It's now processing.

162
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,416
Okay, son.

163
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,885
Wait, have you talked to Tupe yet?

164
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,290
Why does it sound like you know something?

165
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,444
Here's the thing.

166
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,178
Tupe wants to work, too. That's the reason
why he cooked all those meals.

167
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:22,502
So we can have a taste
and get your support.

168
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:26,275
Because he wants to venture into
online food business.

169
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,817
Why won't he tell me?

170
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,036
Really? You're asking me that?

171
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,499
You're too busy.

172
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:35,915
If he mentions it, you become busier.

173
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,005
It's like you're ignoring him.

174
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,102
Not at all.

175
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,842
But I'm really busy these days, dad.

176
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:45,181
I'm neglecting Tupe's presence.

177
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,914
Dad,

178
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,096
how can I make Tupe feel

179
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,310
that I support him and

180
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,554
I'll choose him no matter what.

181
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:59,484
Fix that, son, before it gets worse.

182
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:02,149
Anyway, son. Take care!

183
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:03,269
Yes, dad.

184
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:05,686
Bye, dad.

185
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,700
(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

186
00:16:40,393 --> 00:16:42,290
(Next Episode)
- Alex - How are you guys?

187
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,549
Greg, I know I'm not in the position
to tell you what to do.

188
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:46,586
- But...
- Alex...

189
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:50,414
