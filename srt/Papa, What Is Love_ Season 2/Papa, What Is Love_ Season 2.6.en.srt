(Episode 6 To the Next Chapter)

3
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,170
You said you're going to Japan?

4
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:04,608
I don't care, dad.

5
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,620
What were you thinking?

6
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,650
Why were you in a hurry to get married
to that Dominic?

7
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,072
You've only met him for more than a week.

8
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:16,418
You said you were in Japan
but now you're in Taiwan.

9
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,104
I don't care, dad.

10
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,489
You should get to know him more first.

11
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,788
Oh, Rich.

12
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,600
That smells good.

13
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,721
Good morning, babe!

14
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,972
What's the occassion, babe?

15
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,126
Nothing. I just want to cook for you.

16
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:00,695
But...

17
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:04,452
this is not as delicious as your
"Tupe's Kitchen Online."

18
00:03:06,793 --> 00:03:08,118
What are you going to do today?

19
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:09,477
Why?

20
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,192
Don't you have work today?

21
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:13,122
No work today but

22
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,236
I have something else I want to work on.

23
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:17,338
You're nuts.

24
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,316
Come on.

25
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,265
Let's do it.

26
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,537
Babe, your pancakes.

27
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:38,353
Give it to me.

28
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,400
Babe...

29
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:41,608
Don't you love me?

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:48,374
And besides, we've
been apart for a long time.

31
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,053
Babe, those are just two nights.

32
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,302
No, it's okay if you don't want to.

33
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,616
For me, it's like a year.

34
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,676
If you don't want to, then it's fine.

35
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,012
Do you really want to?

36
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,214
You want that?

37
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,193
That's how you want it.

38
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:15,941
Here's another.

39
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,504
But you know what I really want?

40
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:24,790
Babe...

41
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,339
Babe...

42
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,771
Do you remember the ring I gave you
when we fought?

43
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,835
Where's that?

44
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,066
I put it here somewhere.

45
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:31,304
You placed it there?

46
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,525
It's not here.

47
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,177
Did you see it?

48
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,001
I'm looking but I can't find it.

49
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,421
Just let it be.

50
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,967
It will show up one of these days.

51
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,586
Come here by my side.

52
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:50,940
Sorry, babe.

53
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,855
Why were you looking for it?

54
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,050
Nothing.

55
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:58,729
Alex!

56
00:06:59,082 --> 00:06:59,857
What's up?

57
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,616
You didn't even put on a shirt, Greg.

58
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,582
I was just answering your call right away.

59
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,866
Oh, nothing. Just want to say good bye.

60
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,261
Tupe's also here.

61
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,711
- Hey!
- Hi, Alex!

62
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,377
So you two are now okay?

63
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,125
Hi, Tupe!

64
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:24,421
I was just calling to say good bye.
I'm about to leave.

65
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,880
Looks like you two are okay now, right?

66
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:28,878
That's a relief.

67
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:33,017
I don't need to do a long speech
to say I'm sorry.

68
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,302
Thank you, Alex.

69
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,730
Sorry, Alex.

70
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,848
I was really ashamed of what happened.

71
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:40,025
But...

72
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:42,189
I'm thankful that everything's okay.

73
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,797
That we're okay.

74
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:45,823
Are you sure about that?

75
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,110
Oh.

76
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,521
Just kidding.

77
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,452
You got me nervous for a moment there.

78
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,585
Very well, I have to go.

79
00:07:53,762 --> 00:07:54,969
Take care you two.

80
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,617
Bye, Alex. Take care always.

81
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,170
Good luck!

82
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,585
Bye...

83
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:04,168
Bye...

84
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:17,742
Alex will be okay.
She'll follow her dreams.

85
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,273
Sorry, babe.

86
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,949
I made you feel that you're not enough.

87
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:36,456
Well, I admit that I neglected you but

88
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:37,946
I promise you this:

89
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,004
I will make up for every shortcomings.

90
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:40,587
Okay?

91
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,768
Babe, I'm sorry too.

92
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,378
Because I didn't trust you.

93
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,178
What's important is that we're okay.

94
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,959
- Love you!
- Love you.

95
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,828
Let's go out?

96
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:55,719
Where to?

97
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:00,049
Let's have a dinner date.

98
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:55,497
Let's go, babe.

99
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:57,831
For you.

100
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:00,099
What's this?

101
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:02,376
Open it.

102
00:10:09,663 --> 00:10:10,844
A key.

103
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,845
I just realize you don't
have a key to our house.

104
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,886
So you can go out whenever you want.

105
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,303
Is this different
from the duplicate key you gave me?

106
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,803
What are you talking about?

107
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:29,421
That's a key to our house in Taguig.

108
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,530
House in Taguig?

109
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,244
I just thought that our house is too small

110
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,631
when you start your business.

111
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,075
So we can have a bigger kitchen.

112
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,159
Babe,

113
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,945
we need to save money for that.

114
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:52,846
This is too much.

115
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:53,885
Tupe,

116
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
no.

117
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,657
What's too much is your sacrifices.

118
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:05,727
I wouldn't be this
successful, this productive

119
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,820
if you weren't by my side

120
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,154
to support me.

121
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:16,936
We will start a new life there as a couple.

122
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:19,533
Officially.

123
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:21,794
Why?

124
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:24,036
Aren't we partners officially?

125
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:28,243
Tupe, officially.

126
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,034
What are you talking about?

127
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:35,787
Christopher Danan,

128
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,444
will you be my husband?

129
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,829
Yes.

130
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:13,710
You made me cry.

131
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:23,543
Dad!

132
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,676
Rich!

133
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,930
Congratulations to the two of you!

134
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:30,132
Thank you, dad. Wish you were here.

135
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:31,556
That's okay.

136
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,902
What's important is we're both happy.

137
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,180
Agree?

138
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:37,690
Agree!

139
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,201
Love you! See you!

140
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,821
Bye, dad!

141
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:42,378
Love you, Greg.

142
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,453
Love you.
