(Episode 2 Finding the Right One)

3
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,550
How to date a Gen Z?

4
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,911
Are you an armpit?

5
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,324
Because you're near my heart.

6
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,856
How do you turn this off?

7
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,708
It's obvious I don't live here.

8
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,700
(Hi, Baby boy! Are you free tonight?)

9
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,000
(Oh yes, baby boy! I'm free tonight. rawr)

10
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,400
(excited to meet you, I'll wear pink.)

11
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,808
Oh God.

12
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,001
It's big.

13
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:16,949
Can I handle that?

14
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,700
(Me, too.)

15
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,700
(Hi Daddy, good morning (See attached image))

16
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:40,176
Wow!

17
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,933
He has the guts to call me daddy.

18
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:44,807
Hi, daddy!

19
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,547
- Hi daddy your pussy. Yuck!
- Good morinng!

20
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,010
What's wrong with you?

21
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,594
Breakfast is ready. Let's eat.

22
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,125
Tupe!

23
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:52,278
You're already getting on my nerves.

24
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,543
Stop it with the swiping
on those dating apps.

25
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,394
I'm working here. What are you saying?

26
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,281
Rich...

27
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,201
Come on. Let's eat.

28
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:00,071
Just wait!

29
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,071
I'm not yet finished here.

30
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Rich...

31
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Babe!

32
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,200
(I'm sorry Alex. I hope you can forgive me
and we can move onfrom this.)

33
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,900
(It still hurts, Greg.
I thought he could, that's why I met you.)

34
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
(Let's see each other again.
Let's fix this so we can both be move on.)

35
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
Coming!

36
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,599
Wow!

37
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
What's the occassion?

38
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,226
Those are delicious.

39
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,428
No more eggs and hotdog.
Kare-Kare and Adobo.

40
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:35,602
- Of course!
- Is it someone's birthday today?

41
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:37,622
I really prepared this
to know if I cook good.

42
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,833
I wanted your feedback.

43
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,670
So, when are you leaving?

44
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Ouch.

45
00:05:44,657 --> 00:05:46,257
You're too eager for me to leave?

46
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:47,924
I haven't even eaten yet.

47
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,082
You know what?

48
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,845
I just have a meeting somewhere nearby.

49
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:52,579
What meetings, dad?

50
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:54,869
Here's the thing,

51
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,842
I met someone on the dating app.

52
00:05:57,502 --> 00:05:59,002
We have a "GT" today.

53
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,502
"GT"?

54
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:01,953
GT!

55
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,052
Oh my.

56
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,025
Get together!

57
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,501
You know, son.

58
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:11,383
Aren't you updated
with the slangs of Gen Z?

59
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,689
Are you sure about that, dad?

60
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,265
You don't know what
these kids will do to you.

61
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:17,278
- Overprotective!
- What am I? 18 years old?

62
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:19,682
You're being too much.

63
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,675
Don't judge your generation.

64
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,238
Aren't you the one rushing into things?

65
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,640
You remember Alex?

66
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:27,077
Alex?

67
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,242
His ex-girlfriend.

68
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,228
You remember your birthday celebrations?

69
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,483
- Dad!
- Those were fun.

70
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,872
- There were bands, live music, banners...
- Dad, dad!

71
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:38,332
That's extravagant.

72
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:40,711
I will not also forget.

73
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:43,043
- Your prop...
- Dad!

74
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:45,082
You know what? We should just eat.

75
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,499
Adobo, let's just eat.

76
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,019
Let's eat.

77
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,194
Let's not waste what my babe cooked for us.

78
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:53,935
Let me try this.

79
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,489
This tastes good.

80
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,646
Looks like my diet's
ruined because of this.

81
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,610
Really?

82
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,400
Yes.

83
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,366
Of course...

84
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,325
Tupe is a really good cook.

85
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,023
He can actually marry someone now.

86
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:12,192
Marry already?

87
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:14,756
Can't I just wanted to have these
tasted by you because...

88
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:16,456
Go ahead.

89
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:17,481
Tupe,

90
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,587
is there anything you want to tell Greg?

91
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,945
Really? Now?

92
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:23,955
Go ahead. Tell him.

93
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,920
Babe, the reason why
I prepared all these...

94
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:30,297
Wait, wait.

95
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,848
Sorry, babe. I need to take this.

96
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:35,726
Excuse me.

97
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:39,139
Hey, what's up?

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,819
Relax...

99
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,023
Jealous much?

100
00:07:42,436 --> 00:07:43,640
That's just work.

101
00:07:44,937 --> 00:07:47,393
I'm pretty sure
Greg only has eyes for me.

102
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:48,857
You're confident.

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,472
That's true, babe.

104
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:54,059
I only have eyes for you.

105
00:07:56,202 --> 00:07:57,717
Enough of that.

106
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:58,790
Just kiss already.

107
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,548
You two just kiss.

108
00:08:01,017 --> 00:08:01,623
Here?

109
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,873
Right here. Right now.

110
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,950
1, 2, 3, go. I'll cover my eyes.

111
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:07,537
My God.

112
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:10,170
You two are sweet.

113
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,932
You're already skipping breakfast
for dessert.

114
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,562
Greg...

115
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,861
Babe.

116
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:13,104
Babe...

117
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:18,743
Greg, please.

118
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:20,356
Isn't this what you wanted?

119
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:23,070
I just wanted to cuddle

120
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:25,293
but you went overboard.

121
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,413
Sorry.

122
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:30,083
I just have a lot in my head right now.

123
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,169
Like what?

124
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:34,414
Like Alex?

125
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,175
What?

126
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:37,476
That's nothing.

127
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,844
No. Let's talk about it.

128
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,143
I'll listen.

129
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:43,027
Are you jealous?

130
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,097
Jealous...

131
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,303
You are jealous.

132
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:52,459
No.

133
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,400
You know what, babe?

134
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,320
I know that you love me.

135
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,242
You don't want to lose my body.

136
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,035
Especially this.

137
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,419
You're the one who'll go nuts
if I'm gone.

138
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:13,548
You really are jealous.

139
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:15,804
I said I'm not.

140
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:18,302
Yes, you are.

141
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:20,985
Love you.

142
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,396
Love you.

143
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,900
(Line message from Alex: 1 new message)

144
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,815
Hi, daddy.

145
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
You have nice abs.

146
00:12:54,217 --> 00:12:55,135
Let's go.

147
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,700
(@Nic_69FUN liked your photo.)

148
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,800
(@Nic_69FUN Sorry for late reply.
Let's meet up tonight.)

(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

150
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,026
(Next Episode)

151
00:14:22,051 --> 00:14:23,093
Babe,

152
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,258
I'm going to be late for my meetings.

153
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:28,586
I might come home late.

154
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,589
Let's talk later, okay?

155
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:31,762
Aren't you even going to eat breakfast?

156
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,680
Maybe at the office.

157
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,969
I just really have a lot of meetings today.

158
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,396
Have you talked to Greg already?

159
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:41,981
Almost. Last night.

160
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,694
But the conversation took a different turn.

161
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:48,155
You perverted boys.

162
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:51,103
If I were you, I'd tell him already.

163
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,504
I actually met the perfect guy

164
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,523
but he liked my son more.

165
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,731
Just kidding.

166
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,172
Sorry.

167
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,908
What am I going to do?

168
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,270
Baby Marcus is also wearing pink.
