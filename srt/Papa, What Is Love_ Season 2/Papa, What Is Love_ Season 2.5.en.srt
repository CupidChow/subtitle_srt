(Episode 5 Way Back in to Love)

3
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:06,955
Son, I'll be gone for a week.

4
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:08,792
Don't worry, I'm okay.

5
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,709
I'll tell you everything
when I get back home.

6
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,674
I'll see you soon. You and Tupe take care.

7
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:14,668
Love you.

8
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,348
Hello! Tupe!

9
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,631
Take care of my son, okay?

10
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,929
I'll be gone for days.

11
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,183
So you have the house all to yourselves.

12
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:37,435
You know what to do.

13
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,199
Be good, okay? Take care.

14
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,365
Bye!

15
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:03,228
Greg?

16
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,295
Hello?

17
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:06,431
Alex.

18
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,731
How are you?

19
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:10,678
I don't know.

20
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,270
Greg, I know I'm not in the position

21
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:14,164
to tell you what to do, but...

22
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,726
Alex...

23
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:17,615
Just hear me out, Greg.

24
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:18,661
Please.

25
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:20,824
Greg,

26
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,883
don't do what I did to you.

27
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:28,792
Don't push away the person you love most.

28
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:38,043
Don't make him feel even for a second
that you don't love him back

29
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:41,424
just because of one mistake.

30
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:42,755
Greg,

31
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:46,227
you should know the feeling.

32
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,945
Anyways,

33
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,812
when I saw you two in Boracay,

34
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:52,895
it was clear to me,

35
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,579
You two love each other.

36
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:02,704
I guess that's why I finally decided
to call you back.

37
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:06,115
I guess I wanted what you two have.

38
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:09,546
I'm leaving next week.

39
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,797
I decided to continue art school.

40
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,411
You've been thinking about
doing that that for years.

41
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,001
Anyway,

42
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,179
you two will be okay.

43
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:22,589
Take care, Greg.

44
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,679
Good luck to you and Tupe.

45
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,159
I mean it.

46
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,561
Hello, dad.

47
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,144
What the hello, you're in Japan?

48
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,845
Oh my God, son. I'm
sorry, it was all unexpected.

49
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,046
Spur of the moment.

50
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:13,216
You know, love moving in mysterious ways.

51
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:16,092
And who are you with there?

52
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:18,109
Si Dominic.

53
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:21,164
My son, we clicked the moment we met.

54
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,314
He actually paid for everything in this trip.

55
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:25,577
Yes,

56
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,639
maybe you should be suspicious of me
and not him.

57
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,114
Anyway, how are you there?

58
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,660
How are you and Tupe?

59
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:38,324
We're not okay, dad.

60
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,742
What? What happened?

61
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,084
Did you know that
Alex and Tupe communicated?

62
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,177
Alex and Tupe?

63
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:50,048
- How? Why?
- Same questions actually, dad.

64
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:53,878
I have a theory. Just hear me out.

65
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:58,675
You do realize that Tupe is at home
all day everyday.

66
00:08:58,941 --> 00:09:01,794
He has the time to think about things.

67
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:04,984
He has time to overthink about things.

68
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,563
Son, I'm not siding with Tupe here, okay?

69
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,412
I know him, too.

70
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,789
He wouldn't do anything uncomfortable
or would harm the people he loves.

71
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,961
Yes, dad.

72
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,396
But Tupe...

73
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,037
Son, listen to me.

74
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:23,572
What the two of you have gone through
is no joke.

75
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,141
His sacrifices were no joke.

76
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:26,963
Son,

77
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,956
he left a queen for you, right?

78
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,385
You dethroned me.

79
00:09:33,646 --> 00:09:36,001
Dad, I'm not in the mood for jokes.

80
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,172
Kidding aside,

81
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:38,718
talk to him.

82
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,759
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

83
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,440
You still love him, right?

84
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,402
Yes, dad.

85
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,226
You didn't have to
reach out to Alex, anyway.

86
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,068
We were fine before that.

87
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,852
I don't know, dad.

88
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:58,273
When I saw her in Boracay, I felt guilty.

89
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,407
She didn't have to go through the pain
that I have caused her.

90
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:05,376
And I get to be happy?

91
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:06,861
Sounds unfair.

92
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:11,078
Son, I understand.

93
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:14,456
But maybe it's not yet time.

94
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:16,093
Remember,

95
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,839
"Time heals all wounds."

96
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,879
Okay, dad.

97
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:24,761
Wait,

98
00:10:25,195 --> 00:10:27,522
what are you doing there, dad?

99
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,413
Dominic just can't wait.

100
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,825
Anyway,

101
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,065
Go and talk to Tupe.

102
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,405
- The plane's about to take off.
- Okay, dad.

103
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,860
- Bye! See you soon!
- Bye! Take care!

104
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,951
Am I ugly?

105
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:55,332
Am I easily replaceable?

106
00:11:08,024 --> 00:11:08,926
Tupe,

107
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:14,278
why did you have to be carried away
by your emotions?

108
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:20,567
You lost Greg's trust.

109
00:11:27,827 --> 00:11:29,491
What am I going to do now?

110
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,605
Tupe?

111
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,099
TUPE!

112
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,116
What are you doing?

113
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:03,200
I just wanted to scream underwater

114
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,660
so the neighbors won't hear.

115
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,613
You're unbelievable.

116
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,083
Greg,

117
00:12:10,654 --> 00:12:11,989
I love you.

118
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:17,338
I hope you can forgive me.

119
00:12:19,174 --> 00:12:21,910
I'm sorry if I didn't trust you.

120
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:25,928
You know what, Tupe?

121
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,766
I don't know what I'm going to do
if I lost you.

122
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:34,581
What kind of spell did you put me under

123
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:37,015
that I become this crazy in love with you?

124
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:38,804
What's important is it's working.

125
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:39,900
Really now?

126
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:48,481
I love you, Tupe.

127
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:52,288
- I love you...
- I love you.

128
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,809
No matter what you
want to do with your life.

129
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,921
Even if you want to sell food online.

130
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:00,920
How did you know about that?

131
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,926
You know dad,

132
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,342
he can't keep a secret sometimes.

133
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:06,559
He really is a blabbermouth sometimes.

134
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:10,097
You said it.

135
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,511
What about Alex?

136
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,349
Don't worry about Alex.

137
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,316
And we're okay now.

138
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,993
What do you mean you're okay?

139
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,655
Jealous already?

140
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:25,064
We're okay.

141
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:27,995
And she's flying to America.

142
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,944
At least everything's okay with Alex.

143
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:34,770
And hopefully,

144
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,931
she finds the right
person who will love her.

145
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:40,625
- Hopefully.
- Because as for me,

146
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,678
I already found him.

147
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:05,398
It's dad.

148
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,277
Hi, son!

149
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,059
We're married!

150
00:14:13,004 --> 00:14:14,272
What the f*ck, dad?!

151
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,500
(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

152
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
(Next Episode)

153
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:43,604
What's up?

154
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:46,747
You haven't even put on some shirt.

155
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:49,747
I was just answering your call.

156
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:53,780
I just wanted to say good bye.

157
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tupe is also here.

158
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,406
- Hi, Alex!
- Hi, Tupe!

159
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:04,258
You want that?

160
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:09,388
How about that?
