1
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,500
(It's a match!)

2
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:03,086
Ay!

3
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:23,175
Happy bir... ayyy!

4
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:24,342
Rich!

5
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,850
Oh my God.

6
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,500
(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

7
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,300
(Episode 1 Unfinished Business)

8
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,538
Son!

9
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,300
As you can see, you started
your birthday with an explosion!

10
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:10,340
Your cake exploded!

11
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:13,747
You didn't tell us you were coming, dad.

12
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:14,789
My God,

13
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,930
I remember the first time you met Tupe.

14
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:20,401
Enough of that.

15
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's eat breakfast.

16
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's eat.

17
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:24,000
Or...

18
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:25,400
Maybe I'm the only one
that'll have breakfast.

19
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:26,000
Why?

20
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,343
Because it looks like
you've already eaten your breakfast.

21
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,126
Dad, I need to go.

22
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:35,102
Why?

23
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,025
I have clients waiting.

24
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,069
Are you not going to eat, son?

25
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,115
What about the cake? Blow your cake!

26
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,779
Oh, right.

27
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,234
You've already been blown.

28
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,115
Sorry, what am I talking about?

29
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,117
I need to go, Dad.

30
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,921
Hotdog?
Bye, babe. Bye, dad!

31
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,831
Bye!

32
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,072
Love you.

33
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:58,833
So...

34
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:02,071
We're left alone together again.

35
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,550
Seems like it.

36
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:07,516
Let's eat!

37
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:10,264
Oh, Tupe.

38
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,309
You're always taking care of me.

39
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:12,813
Just eat.
Stop it already, okay?

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
You're not a helper here.

41
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:15,375
I know!

42
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,000
And I'm happy with what I'm doing.

43
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,012
You know what, Tupe?

44
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,148
I know how you love my son.

45
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay?

46
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,600
And always remember,

47
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:26,000
don't forget about yourself.

48
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,176
Because

49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,620
all you've got is yourself.

50
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:29,333
Okay?

51
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,003
My God!

52
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:37,287
What happened to you?

53
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,004
Look!

54
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:39,187
What's that?

55
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,910
Isn't it big?!

56
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:43,807
You're a pervert, Rich.

57
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:47,998
You haven't tried something that big?

58
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:49,875
Stop your nonsense, Rich.

59
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:51,603
I'm sure, you just finished with a biggie.

60
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,030
But what I'm saying is,

61
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,350
find some things that will make you happy.

62
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,283
That will make your relationship happy.

63
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,738
Okay?

64
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:19,373
Alex.

65
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:23,014
How are you?

66
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,347
Can you put some lotion on my back?

67
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:43,749
Okay.

68
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,236
How are you adjusting to my son's house?

69
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,751
It's okay.

70
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:53,472
Ouch!

71
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,407
Are you for real?

72
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,424
Be careful with how you put on lotion.

73
00:05:57,587 --> 00:06:00,187
You might ruin my beautiful complexion.

74
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:03,279
It's hard to achieve this golden tan.

75
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:05,996
Oh God...

76
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:08,725
I need to attend to Bambi's party.

77
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:11,551
It's that bitch's birthday party later.

78
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,705
Was that the one that
sent you the photo earlier?

79
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,930
What's wrong with you, Tupe?

80
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,560
You're not reading the script again.

81
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,075
You know what, in this scene,

82
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:20,448
you're Deborah Sun.

83
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:21,811
You don't have lines here.

84
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,023
Just keep on putting lotion on me.

85
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,905
From what movie is that?

86
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:33,065
Temptation Island!

87
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,298
Joey Gosiegfiao.

88
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,000
Intense, right?

89
00:06:36,046 --> 00:06:38,446
You know, it's as intense as your
relationship with Greg.

90
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,425
Is it still intense?

91
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,386
Yes, why?

92
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:44,997
Oh my.

93
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:47,894
I don't know about my son,
why would he leave us here...

94
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,844
TOGETHER!

95
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:53,072
Did he forget that we were together before?

96
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:54,384
Rich...

97
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:55,841
Sorry about that.

98
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:56,866
Just kidding!

99
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,010
You're being too serious.

100
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,081
You know what, Tupe?
I'm fine now.

101
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,178
Promise!

102
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,048
Nothing to worry.

103
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,724
What matters to me is that

104
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:09,745
you're the one dating my only son.

105
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:12,752
MORE!

106
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,371
Rich,

107
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:20,312
do you think it's okay for Greg
if I look for a job?

108
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,516
Of course.

109
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,023
Why not?

110
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:27,177
Nothing. It's just lately,

111
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
it's hard to talk to him.

112
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:31,054
It's like he's not himself.

113
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:32,723
I'm asking what's on his mind

114
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,500
but he's not responding

115
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,288
or he changes the topic.

116
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:37,817
You know what?

117
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,284
Just try to talk to him.

118
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:41,584
He'll understand.

119
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:43,572
Just talk.

120
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
(How to cook Kare-Kare)

121
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:36,519
So...

122
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,982
Happy birthday to us?

123
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:41,687
Yes,

124
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,269
happy birthday to us.

125
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:46,914
It's nice that you've finally
agreed to see me after two years.

126
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,025
I saw you...

127
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:01,418
sa Boracay.

128
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,147
With someone.

129
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:08,123
Happy.

130
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,489
Yeah.

131
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,416
I saw you, too.

132
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Is that why you sent me an audio message

133
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,031
while you were drunk?

134
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,024
Then you continue sending
me messages after that.

135
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,144
I'm sorry, Alex.

136
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,490
I just want everything to be okay.

137
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,468
Right...

138
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,077
Is that all?

139
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:48,358
Well...

140
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,603
I'm here to tell you

141
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:53,871
that

142
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,924
you can stop bothering me.

143
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:02,157
You can stop calling me,

144
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:04,471
you can stop asking

145
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:08,422
what's happening in my life right now.

146
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,330
You can stop.

147
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:12,323
Sorry, Alex.

148
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:18,472
You left me, Alex.

149
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:19,700
You know...

150
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,792
My life has lost direction
when you left me for a year.

151
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:25,069
Wow.

152
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,006
Wow!

153
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:32,329
You have the balls to say that?

154
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:34,428
After you've slept with another man

155
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,540
months after proposing to me!

156
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Greg, we're going to get married.

157
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:40,262
Alex...

158
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,610
Married!

159
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:45,626
Alex, I'm sorry.

160
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:46,628
I was drunk.

161
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,000
Greg!

162
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,359
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

163
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:57,343
With another man!

164
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,310
Another man, Greg!

165
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:01,563
I know, Alex.

166
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,160
What was I supposed to think?

167
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:06,681
What am I supposed to feel?

168
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,033
I know...

169
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:09,329
Alex...

170
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,000
You know,

171
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:13,035
we don't need a recap of what happened.

172
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,759
You're still a drama queen

173
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:17,816
like dad.

174
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:28,717
You know what?

175
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:33,152
Say hi to your dad for me.

176
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,549
Since we're both drama queens, right?

177
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:40,564
You know what?

178
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:45,511
I shouldn't have met with you.

179
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:47,309
Alex...

180
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,076
Are you okay now?

181
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:52,823
Are you happy now?

182
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:53,952
Happy birthday!

183
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:56,751
Happy birthday to you, me, to us?

184
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:58,014
Are you happy now?

185
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,507
Is it a happy birthday for you?

186
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,180
Are you okay now?

187
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:03,423
Please...

188
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,821
Let's just forget about each other.

189
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:07,675
Alex, please.

190
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,144
Stop.

191
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:13,084
- Alex.
- Bye, Greg.

Don't judge your generation.

That's extravagant.

201
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:01,027
Sorry, but I have to take this.
Excuse me.

Jelous much?

204
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,233
That's just work.

Greg, please.

208
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:22,305
- Isn't this what you wanted?
- I just want to cuddle

209
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,559
then you went extreme.

210
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,456
Hi, daddy...

211
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,767
