(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(Episode 3 Pink Party)

3
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,229
Good morning!

4
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:33,954
Looks like you had a good night's sleep.

5
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,334
Of course, I wasn't
just sleeping last night.

6
00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,304
Why the long face this morning?

7
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,220
It's as if you're not
"sleeping" well every night.

8
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,307
By the way, where's my son?

9
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,609
There. Talking to someone on the phone.

10
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:51,822
You're being too jealous.

11
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:54,027
You're jealous about everything.

12
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,832
I'm telling you this,

13
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:59,185
you're the only person my son loves.

14
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:01,436
Come on now,

15
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:03,234
smile!

16
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:05,997
Go on, smile.

17
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:17,799
Rich, what happened to your GT?

18
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,223
It was okay.

19
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,090
He's young, fresh,

20
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,261
those type of guys
that can make you stay up all night.

21
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,573
You've seen his thing
on the picture, right?

22
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,205
It was big, right?

23
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:32,234
Wasn't that edited?

24
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:33,718
No. It was huge!

25
00:03:36,436 --> 00:03:37,136
But...

26
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:38,479
of course,

27
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,347
at my age,

28
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,870
someone who's great at sex is not enough.

29
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,416
What I'm looking for now is someone
with the same age,

30
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,064
maybe younger,

31
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,075
or just someone I can connect with.

32
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,083
Like we're always on the same page.

33
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:01,017
I actually met someone
who's my perfect match

34
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,004
but he chose my son over me.

35
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:09,068
Just kidding.

36
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:12,045
Sorry.

37
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:14,226
Wait.

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,100
By the way,

39
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,958
I already have another date later.

40
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:20,609
- Already?
- Yes!

41
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,011
I just went home to freshen up.

42
00:04:23,403 --> 00:04:24,403
Just to change my outfit.

43
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:27,951
So when I leave later,
I might go straight to my house.

44
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,009
Okay?

45
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,251
So I just have one thing to say:

46
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:32,051
enjoy.

47
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,643
And I also have one thing to say to you,

48
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:36,834
one at a time.

49
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,808
Don't overuse your body.

50
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:42,027
What I mean is your heart.

51
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:43,005
Okay?

52
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,290
You and your green mind.

53
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:47,693
Wait a minute.

54
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:51,232
Have you already told Greg
about your plans?

55
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,744
Almost. Last night.

56
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,369
But the conversation took a different turn.

57
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,097
You perverted boys.

58
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:03,231
If I were you, I would tell Greg now.

59
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:05,865
When are you going to tell him?

60
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,700
Like what Tito Boy said,

61
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,255
"Tomorrow is never promised."

62
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,090
That's why you should tell him already. Go!

63
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:13,687
It's really hard to talk to Greg lately.

64
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:17,420
Oh. Are you guys talking about me?

65
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:18,842
Looks like you have plans for me.

66
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,380
You love yourself too much.

67
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:22,373
Go ahead.

68
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,968
You two should talk. Okay?

69
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,204
I will go ahead and freshen up.
I have a date.

70
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:29,761
I won't finish this.

71
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:31,686
Go and talk.

72
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,472
- Take care, dad!
- Bye!

73
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:40,988
Put that aside and let's eat.

74
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:41,639
Babe,

75
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,462
I'm going to be late for my meetings.

76
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,984
And I might come home late.

77
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,554
Let's talk later, okay?

78
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,524
Aren't you even going
to eat your breakfast?

79
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,916
Maybe at the office.

80
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,582
I really have a lot of meetings today.

81
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:56,342
Okay?

82
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,931
Don't be sad.

83
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,264
When I get home later,

84
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,585
I'm all yours.

85
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:04,999
Okay?

86
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:55,017
I hate you.

87
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,306
You left me alone here.

88
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,142
You know what?

89
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,854
I miss you so much.

90
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,269
I miss all our conversations.

91
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:32,029
I miss all the fun times with you.

92
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:36,077
The people I'm talking to right now

93
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:39,790
are all in the virtual world.

94
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:43,959
It's hard to be alone.
Do you know that?

95
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:49,671
There's no one telling me

96
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:54,749
that I look good before I go out.

97
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:57,420
There's no one telling me

98
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,807
that I look really pretty.

99
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,767
My God.

100
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,278
Am I doing the right thing?

101
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,082
I don't like being like this.

102
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,548
Makes me haggard.

103
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,916
I need to be fresh. I have a date later.
You're making me cry.

104
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,703
But this, I promise you,

105
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:35,249
when I find the one,
I'll introduce him to you.

106
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:36,692
Okay?

107
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,976
Okay now. I'll be late.

108
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:14,827
My God.

109
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,654
What is this?

110
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,432
Campaign rally?

111
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:21,047
I was not informed.

112
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:24,555
And I didn't see this in the news.

113
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,759
Baby shower?

114
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:28,639
What am I going to do?

115
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:31,974
Baby Marcus is also wearing pink.

116
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,000
Hi, sir.

117
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,066
- Hi!
- Do you have company?

118
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:37,340
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.

119
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,583
By the way, sir. You can avail
yourself to our discounts today.

120
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,194
Because you're wearing pink today.

121
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,995
Right this way, sir.

122
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,021
Can I have a glass of water?

123
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,015
Sure, sir.

124
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,499
While waiting.

125
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,764
Thank you.

126
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,309
Sir, here's your glass of water.

127
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:36,405
Are you okay, sir?

128
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,205
Yes!

129
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:41,722
Come here.

130
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:47,560
Why of all the colors in the
world, you chose the color pink?

131
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,806
Why not blue, dark
brown or chocolate brown?

132
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,077
The favorite color of
the owner is pink, sir.

133
00:11:58,274 --> 00:11:59,114
PINK?!

134
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:04,744
I love pink.

135
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:06,618
It's actually my favorite.

136
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:08,079
That's good to know, sir.

137
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:13,297
Okay. Just give me your bestseller.

138
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,382
Coming right up, sir.

139
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
(Where are you?)

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
(Nice traffic daddy, I’m still from afar)

141
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,900
(LOL so funny. Okay. Take care.)

142
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,500
(Sorry late reply. Let’s meet up tonight.)

143
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,448
My God.

144
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,114
Why did you reply just now?

145
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,823
I already have a date.

146
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,755
Hi, boss! Same order?

147
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:46,397
Yes, thank you.

148
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,000
(Your smile is beautiful. I hope you always smile.)

149
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,100
(Looks like you’ve been waiting for a long time.
Maybe your partner is playing with you. You deserve to be treated better.)

150
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,000
(How did you know?)

151
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,500
(Look to your right.)

152
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,158
Uhm...

153
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:16,697
Dominic?

154
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:19,733
Yes. Nice to finally meet you.

155
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,706
What are you doing here?

156
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,616
Actually, I own this restaurant.

157
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,780
Welcome to my Pink Party!

158
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:36,292
Oh. It's a party.

159
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:40,154
I thought it was a campaign rally.

160
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:48,598
Have a seat.

161
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,429
You own the place. I'll sit down.

162
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,600
(Papa, What is Love?) Season 2

163
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:37,748
(Next Episode)
Yes, I still have feelings for Greg.

164
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,561
That should be surprising since..

165
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,282
Alex...

166
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,633
It's better for you to go.

167
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,052
Tupe,

168
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:50,035
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,356
I know none of this is your fault.

170
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,592
Where have you been all my life?

171
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:01,141
Rihanna?

172
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:03,572
Dad,

173
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:07,605
How can I show Tupe that I support him

174
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:10,178
and I'll choose him no matter what?

175
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:13,276
Fix that before it gets worse.

176
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:14,700
Open that.

177
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:20,656
Greg?

178
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,967
I'm sorry.

179
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:31,633
Tupe! Leave me alone.

180
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,965
Just leave me alone.
