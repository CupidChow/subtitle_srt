(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,978
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:04,379
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,779
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,020
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,100
(28 years ago in Jwamulchon,
Amnokgok, West Goguryeo)

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,380
(Eul Pa So)

8
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,860
It's gross.

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,220
(Eul Eum, Eul Pa So's grandfather)

10
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,939
It is your grandfather.

11
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,220
We, the Euls,

12
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,700
were the royal family of Juna.

13
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,619
We helped Goguryeo
that wanted our wisdom...

14
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,140
to fight against Han.

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,859
Eul So who helped King Yu Ri...

16
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,099
defeat Northern Buyeo...

17
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,098
Eul Du Ji who repelled
the governor of Liaodong...

18
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,780
with King Daemusin's
soldiers are your ancestors.

19
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,659
But King Taejo who was afraid of us...

20
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,019
sent mounted warriors to destroy Juna.

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,620
They captured Eul Eum who
was the then prince of Juna.

22
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,550
They cut the tendons
of his hands and feet...

23
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,379
and pulled out his tongue and eyes,

24
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,030
leaving him to die as a
wretched cripple like that.

25
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,859
As the royal offspring of Juna,

26
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,099
you must wreak vengeance
for your grandfather.

27
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,699
What are you doing? Kneel!

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,500
My name is Eul Pa So.

29
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,556
I am the descendant of Eul Eum
who is the descendant of Maek...

30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,258
and has the blood of Jolbon.

31
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,900
He is King Onjo's uncle.

32
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,899
I am a royal offspring of Juna,

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,740
which was destroyed by
the Royal Family of Go.

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,819
(Yeon Bi, Jolbon Chieftain)

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,779
Your Highness, this man...

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,539
We share a bloodline.

37
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,818
(Mok Do, the great elder)

38
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,659
Although the bloodline
was cut off long ago.

39
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,020
So what brought you here?

40
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,659
I would like to borrow
the strength of Jolbon.

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,819
If you lend me your strength,

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,019
I will help you regain
the old land of Jolbon,

43
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,379
which was taken by Goguryeo.

44
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,538
(Queen Woo)

45
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:43,220
(Episode 6)

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,659
Your Highness!

47
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,899
It is near Baeuitu.

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,580
(Fifth Prince Go Gye Su)

49
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,740
Send someone to Baeuitu immediately...

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,500
to check the situation in the south.

51
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,340
Wake up the soldiers and get them armed.

52
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,139
Yes, Your Highness!

53
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,939
Gal Ro!

54
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,498
If we cross the river
by boat at the dock...

55
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:28,659
and block the way,

56
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,899
we will definitely be able
to capture the Queen!

57
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:32,340
We do not need to capture her.

58
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:36,539
- Kill her!
- However, the Third Prince...

59
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,179
Gal Ro.

60
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:53,340
Gal Ro.

61
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,700
Gal Ro!

62
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,859
Now,

63
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,659
kill the Queen.

64
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
I think we should fix
the wheel before we go.

65
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,939
How long do you think it will last?

66
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,460
At this rate,

67
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,899
the wheel will come off even
before we cross the mountains.

68
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,739
How about we fix it before we go?

69
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,700
We cut off the bridge. They will
not be able to chase us easily.

70
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,380
No.

71
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,580
We cannot lower our guards yet.

72
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,179
He will chase us no matter what it takes.

73
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:09,940
Since you have never lost,

74
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,340
there would be nothing to be afraid of.

75
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,020
No. I am also...

76
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,099
afraid of someone.

77
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
Who is it?

78
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,260
Who dares to frighten you?

79
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,820
No. Do not tell me.

80
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:30,059
I will make a guess.

81
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:36,940
The governor of Liaodong
already lost to you.

82
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,819
Baekje is no threat to us...

83
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,260
as they are busy fighting Saro here.

84
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,739
I think it is King Wigutae...

85
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,739
of Northern Buyeo over there.

86
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,539
It would have been better...

87
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,980
if you had helped with politics
by my side, not just as the queen.

88
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,499
But you are wrong.

89
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,179
Even though Wigutae is
strong, as long as I live,

90
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,260
he will never be able to threaten Goguryeo.

91
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,020
Then...

92
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,059
who is it?

93
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,900
The ones I truly fear...

94
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,179
are not these people.

95
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,859
Those who smile on the outside,

96
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,020
but are hiding a knife behind their back.

97
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,979
I fear people like them.

98
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,459
Are you going to leave the Third Prince...

99
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,378
to go to the Fifth Prince?

100
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,460
(Fifth)

101
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,019
(King)

102
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,019
The soldiers are on standby
and ready to go to war at anytime.

103
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,499
Who do you think killed the King?

104
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,619
Every tribe has rightful
reasons to do that,

105
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:40,099
but I think...

106
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,379
it is Eul Pa So.

107
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,259
It suits you.

108
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,898
(6 years ago)

109
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:53,430
So, my blood brother,

110
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:55,700
what will you do now?

111
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,019
I will isolate the King.

112
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,430
When the people turn away from him,

113
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,340
I will use Bal Gi to start a rebellion.

114
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,979
Bal Gi?

115
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,235
Do you think you can
win against the King...

116
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,099
with the power of someone like him?

117
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,859
It does not matter.

118
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,180
Because the King will be
bleeding when the fight ends.

119
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,700
What if the King dies...

120
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,180
before that?

121
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,019
I will make the Queen marry Bal Gi.

122
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,259
A levirate marriage?

123
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,619
Do you think she will accept it?

124
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,940
I will make her do that.

125
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,619
The princes will slaughter
one another for the throne,

126
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:49,539
which will destroy the Royal Family of Go.

127
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,259
And a new Goguryeo will emerge.

128
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,420
(Queen, Fifth Prince)

129
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,820
I am sorry, but you will have...

130
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,899
to be a chess piece on
the board a little longer.

131
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,859
(Third Prince, Queen, Fifth Prince)

132
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:17,019
(Lady Jwa, Bal Gi's wife)

133
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,978
(Asabeol, a village of
mounted warriors in the south)

134
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:37,019
If the King has truly died,

135
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,580
why are you telling us?

136
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:45,460
The Third Prince has a
legitimate right to the throne,

137
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
but there will surely
be those who oppose it.

138
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,460
He promised to grant you
the position of Gochuga...

139
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:54,180
if you help him ascend the throne.

140
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:55,859
(Gochuga, a noble title of Goguryeo)

141
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,660
We southerners, as descendants of Hwan Ung,

142
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,940
had a lower status than other tribes.

143
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,580
If you receive the title of Gochuga,

144
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,820
we will be in the same
position as the royal family.

145
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,059
He has a point.

146
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,898
Do you remember what happened...

147
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,299
to those who stood on the side
of the crown prince long ago?

148
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,060
The succession to the throne
is a matter for the royal family.

149
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,820
It is our tribe's rule
not to get involved in...

150
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,139
the affairs of the royal family in any way.

151
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,899
That is why we were safe...

152
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,099
in the war between the
King and the crown prince.

153
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,420
My lord, we...

154
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:49,899
What was your name? Dal Ga?

155
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,098
Those without names take
the names of the old tribes...

156
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:59,259
and call each other horses,
cows, pigs, sheep, and dogs.

157
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:03,099
But when they become Daemodal,
they have the honour of receiving names.

158
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,099
When they become the head of the tribe,

159
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,540
they are granted surnames as well.

160
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:10,979
What do you think?

161
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:13,979
Do you not want to have a surname?

162
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,540
I cannot disobey his order.

163
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:39,340
Do we have three hours left?

164
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,620
How far off are we from
the Fourth Prince's fiefdom?

165
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,820
Did you just say the Fourth
Prince and not the youngest?

166
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:50,259
Your Majesty. Why the Fourth Prince?

167
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,420
Because there is
something worth protecting.

168
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,180
The Third Prince will not accept it.

169
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,820
- If a war breaks out...
- The King of Goguryeo...

170
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,300
is for me to decide.

171
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,139
If he does not accept it,

172
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,340
I will defeat him the way...

173
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:07,700
His Majesty defeated the Crown Prince.

174
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,018
(Baeuitu, Fifth Prince's
fortress, Fourth Prince's fortress)

175
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,300
Did you say they headed to
the Fourth Prince's fortress?

176
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Yes.

177
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,339
Are you sure they are not
headed to the youngest prince?

178
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,300
The Baeuitu soldiers said...

179
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:34,660
they crossed the Amnok
River and headed east.

180
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,779
It is clear she gave
up on the Third Prince,

181
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:45,379
but why pick the Fourth Prince
who knows nothing about war...

182
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,660
instead of the youngest
with a well-armoured army?

183
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:11,899
She goes upstream to the
Fourth Prince, not the Fifth.

184
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,860
To go to the Fourth Prince's fortress,

185
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,420
they must scale the southern mountain.

186
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,340
The horse-drawn cart will
slow on the long uphill slope.

187
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:27,259
Our advance party...

188
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,979
will get them before
they leave the mountain.

189
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Go!

190
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,940
(Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit)

191
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,820
(Chukshi: The Time of the Ox, 1am to 3am)

192
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:50,300
Song Woo knows where Her Majesty is headed.

193
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,379
Will she be safe?

194
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,899
I took care of it already.

195
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,139
What concerns me more...

196
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,858
is the fact that there is a
place no one must set foot in.

197
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,300
(Eastern Temple Sabaegol)

198
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,660
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

199
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,820
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

200
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,579
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

201
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,460
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

202
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,019
Darn it.

203
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,420
Brother.

204
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,779
Let us do as Her Majesty says.

205
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,979
We cannot climb this mountain
with wheels in that state.

206
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,460
Plus, a Wangdang should obey his Queen.

207
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,390
Your Majesty.

208
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,660
It could be dangerous.

209
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,979
The Fourth Prince's fiefdom is
on the other side of the forest.

210
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,870
This is the only path if we
are to return before sunrise.

211
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,059
What will you do?

212
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,739
Your Majesty. Let us
return to the Third Prince.

213
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,019
Our pursuers cannot hurt us then.

214
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,390
I will lead the way.

215
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Come along.

216
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Release the horses.

217
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,660
Wheel tracks and footprints
going separate ways.

218
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:57,110
Someone is assisting us.

219
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,499
Noe Eum, move forward.

220
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,819
Let loose the lantern!

221
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:06,899
Alert the second party of our location...

222
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,539
while we give chase on foot.

223
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:29,539
We go to Sabaegol.

224
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,700
An offering has come.

225
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,539
Let us give it to our deity!

226
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:53,870
Get the offering.

227
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:06,019
This will be a noisy affair.

228
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Yu Ha.

229
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,259
Come on over, punks!

230
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,380
Your Majesty. Wait here for a while.

231
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,100
Here is one.

232
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,180
I found one!

233
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:30,100
Over here!

234
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,819
Brother.

235
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Hide.

236
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
They found us.

237
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,380
This is King Chu Mo's
style that royals are taught.

238
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:19,779
Beware, everyone.

239
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:23,660
Stay low.

240
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,739
Come here, you crazies!

241
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,299
Kill them all!

242
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
Die!

243
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:23,380
You do not stand a
chance in a fight against me!

244
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,579
Die!

245
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,700
Die!

246
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,140
Are they in their right mind or not?

247
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,420
Mo Chi.

248
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,779
Come on!

249
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,940
Get him!

250
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:28,779
Come here.

251
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:54,299
Die!

252
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
Hurry.

253
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,420
How dare you hallucinating
crazies get in my way?

254
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
Pa Ya.

255
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:48,259
Find out if the Queen
went to the Fourth Prince...

256
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,819
- or the royal palace.
- I will.

257
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,259
And...

258
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,700
I will lead you to the Queen.

259
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:34,259
(Inshi: The Time of the Tiger, 3am to 5am)

260
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,259
Not even you...

261
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,979
can go straight into the
Fourth Prince's fortress.

262
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,819
I will open you a path.

263
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,420
Can we trust that woman?

264
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,299
If she is deceiving us...

265
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:23,299
Be prepared.

266
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,339
We go to the Fourth Prince's fortress.

267
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:38,019
Your Majesty.

268
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,660
If you wish to change your
mind, now is the only time.

269
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,499
If I were to do so, I would
not have come this far.

270
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,940
The Chief Priest resides
with the Fourth Prince.

271
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:50,140
The Chief Priest has no army...

272
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Lead the way.

273
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:05,059
Come along.

274
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,339
Is the Fourth Prince in?

275
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,900
What brings you here?

276
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,979
Do I need a reason...

277
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,700
to see my husband?

278
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
I apologize.

279
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:32,420
His Highness is handling
something important.

280
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,059
He does not wish to be disturbed.

281
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,299
(Secretary Yeo Jin)

282
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:58,989
Leave.

283
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
Get out!

284
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,859
It is different.

285
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,739
It is not the same.

286
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:13,899
Your Highness.

287
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,060
No.

288
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,220
Bring the real Queen.

289
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,939
The Queen was more...

290
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:25,029
- Madam secretary.
- She was...

291
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,739
Your Highness. Outside the fortress...

292
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:40,620
The Queen...

293
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,299
Her Majesty is here.

294
00:35:44,549 --> 00:35:47,299
(Fourth Prince Go Yeon Woo)

295
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,509
What?

296
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,819
The Queen?

297
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,660
It will soon be the Time of the Rabbit.

298
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,339
Before then,

299
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:11,580
it must all be done.

300
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:13,989
Your Highness.

301
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,060
This is too drab!

302
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,620
This is not right either.

303
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:26,779
Why do I not have any decent clothes?

304
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:28,579
Your Highness, please calm down.

305
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,139
You need not hurry to...

306
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,660
My sister-in-law awaits.

307
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,029
Get me other clothes. Hurry.

308
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
This one?

309
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:40,339
No, never mind.

310
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:44,989
Your Highness.

311
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,509
The Fourth Prince is here.

312
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,580
Let him in.

313
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,060
What?

314
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:02,459
She is coming out.

315
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,029
It has been a long time, Sister-in-law.

316
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:29,939
Let us have a seat first.

317
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,339
Sure.

318
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:40,899
Right.

319
00:38:44,459 --> 00:38:45,989
You have been this near,

320
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,259
but I have not gotten to see you.

321
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,620
Right.

322
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,700
Anyway, what brought you here at this hour?

323
00:39:11,859 --> 00:39:13,459
Well, I...

324
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,429
I will tell them to bring a new one.

325
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,220
It is all right.

326
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,140
We can share yours together.

327
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,259
Right...

328
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:14,180
I came here today...

329
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,549
because there was
something I needed to tell you.

330
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:23,549
His Majesty...

331
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,549
His Majesty passed away.

332
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:32,549
What?

333
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,779
You mean, my older brother?

334
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,819
Is that true?

335
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:40,059
Did he really...

336
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Prime Minister Eul is
investigating at the moment.

337
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,660
What...

338
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:47,259
If His Majesty's death is revealed,

339
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:52,060
the Jwa Family and the Woo Family
will try to kill me to take revenge.

340
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:53,938
They cannot dare...

341
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:55,620
I want you to protect me.

342
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
What?

343
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
How can I...

344
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,100
If you take the throne,

345
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:07,379
they will not dare attempt to kill me.

346
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:10,419
What...

347
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,739
Nam Mu had no son.

348
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:30,819
So naturally, Bal Gi will be
the next to take the throne.

349
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:34,339
There is no way I can become a king.

350
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:39,459
You can, if you agree to a
levirate marriage with me.

351
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,379
Excuse me?

352
00:41:56,899 --> 00:41:57,939
What...

353
00:41:58,899 --> 00:41:59,939
Why...

354
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:49,179
If you agree to a
levirate marriage with me,

355
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,259
you will get to have the throne...

356
00:42:52,419 --> 00:42:54,060
as well as me.

357
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:15,299
Your Highness.

358
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,779
Later. Save it for later!

359
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,180
I apologize, but someone
suspicious has come to the gate.

360
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:24,299
What?

361
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,738
Lilies of the valley are poisonous,

362
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,100
but they can also be
medicinal if a little is used.

363
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,458
We found only a bit of them
in the Head Maid's room.

364
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:27,476
Besides, they were young leaves.
Young leaves are not as poisonous.

365
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,580
It may be fatal to small
animals like chickens,

366
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,779
but it is not enough to kill someone.

367
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,500
Are you sure?

368
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Yes.

369
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:46,580
Search her room a little more.

370
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,660
Sa Bi and the Head Maid
may not be the culprits...

371
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,419
(The Queen is on her
way to the Fourth Prince.)

372
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,939
As expected,

373
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,700
you are the spy.

374
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,739
Head Secretary Song Woo.

375
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:32,419
What do you think you are
doing in the Head Maid's room?

376
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,580
Answer me!

377
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,180
- Let us go.
- Yes.

378
00:46:48,419 --> 00:46:49,580
Tell me immediately.

379
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,620
Poison made with lilies of the valley...

380
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,779
was found in this room.

381
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,819
If His Majesty was murdered,

382
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,980
the culprit will try to
make our family suspected.

383
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:29,060
They will try to frame me too.

384
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,140
Then, our family will cease to exist.

385
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:26,779
She went to the Fourth
Prince, not the Fifth.

386
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,899
Are you trying to have your own fight...

387
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,739
away from my plans?

388
00:49:53,939 --> 00:49:55,259
But with the Fourth Prince,

389
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,939
you will not be able to defeat Bal Gi.

390
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,060
(Queen)

391
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:20,220
(Work by Director Jeong Se Gyo)

392
00:54:02,779 --> 00:54:04,659
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

393
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,539
(and episodes are partially fictional.)

394
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,418
(Even if any are related to reality, )

395
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:10,500
(it is by coincidence.)
