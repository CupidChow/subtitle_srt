1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,433
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,063
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:03,064 --> 00:00:04,663
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:04,664 --> 00:00:06,888
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,652
(18 years ago)

6
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,280
So she is the Second Princess.

7
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:45,149
I am Mil Woo, Wangdang's Daemodal.

8
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,719
The one who taught His Highness
swordsmanship when he was young?

9
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,560
Did His Highness even tell you about that?

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,199
If you ever come to the northern region,

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,700
teach her how to wield a sword.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,200
She will become a much
better disciple than I.

13
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,239
I shall certainly visit.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,768
Please head inside.

15
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,439
His Majesty is waiting.

16
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,510
They are His Highness's brothers.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
The Third Prince, the Fourth Prince,

18
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,310
and the Youngest Prince.

19
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,450
(Fifth Prince, Go Gye Su)

20
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,120
And he is?

21
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:54,889
His Highness's elder brother...

22
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,328
as well as the First and Crown Prince.

23
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,489
He will become the next King of Goguryeo.

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,500
Your Majesty. The princes have all arrived.

25
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,610
I am...

26
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:20,110
to return to King Chu Mo's side soon.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,180
It is time...

28
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,490
for me to pass this jade
ring over to the next king.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you certain about it, Your Majesty?

30
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,669
I...

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,509
made an unforgivable mistake.

32
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,039
And that was losing
Buwon, the northern land...

33
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,750
King Taejo bequeathed,

34
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,120
to the Han Dynasty.

35
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,289
This is the only way to win it back.

36
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:04,629
Do not question my decision anymore.

37
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,789
However, the late Prime Minister...

38
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,030
chose the First Prince as...

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,129
Myeong Rim Dap Bu.

40
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,098
That old fox had the
First Prince crowned...

41
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,008
not for Goguryeo...

42
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:22,210
but for his own family.

43
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,169
His Highness will not accept it.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,409
And what can he do about it?

45
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,560
Since King Chu Mo built Goguryeo,

46
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,430
the power to govern this country...

47
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,800
came from the point of the sword.

48
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,509
If you want it so dearly,

49
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:36,050
you must fight for it.

50
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,389
I...

51
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,029
would like to rest now.

52
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:11,720
(Goguryeo's 8th King, Go Baek
Go, King Sindae, passes away.)

53
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,800
Bow.

54
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,720
Rise.

55
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,439
Dear son of paradise, Hae Mo Su,
and daughter of Ha Baek, Yu Hwa.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,370
We announce that the
eighth King Baek Go's son,

57
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,508
Go Nam Mu, will succeed King Chu Mo...

58
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,519
and become the ninth King of Goguryeo.

59
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,720
We pay our respects...

60
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,620
to the new king.

61
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,029
Bow.

62
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,000
(Year 179, Goguryeo's 9th King,
Go Nam Mu, ascends the throne.)

63
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,729
(Queen Woo)

64
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,800
(Episode 4)

65
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,959
Once I become the king,

66
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,729
I will punish all those after the throne.

67
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,230
(West Hae Family Tribe)

68
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,160
(Jolbon)

69
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,199
There is one problem.

70
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,269
Even if you capture the Queen,
Your Highness has a wife.

71
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,480
It will be tough to get
appointed as the King.

72
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,019
Another with the right
of succession will step in.

73
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,240
(Crown Prince Go Pae Eui)

74
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,169
If I abandon my wife for Queen Woo,

75
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:55,509
I will lose the Jwa Family.

76
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,750
If I cannot win the Queen over,

77
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,419
Pae Eui might take the throne.

78
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,210
(Mount Geomryong, the fiefdom
of the North Queen Family)

79
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,509
What if the Queen left with Bal Gi?

80
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,678
If they return to the palace,

81
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,679
the Woo Family will once
again become the Queen Family.

82
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,220
Then what will happen to Bal Gi's wife,

83
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,720
who is my older sister?

84
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,259
Do you still not know what Bal Gi is like?

85
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,399
Lord Myeong Rim. Even the assassins failed.

86
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,669
What will you do now?

87
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:04,679
The Queen can never return to the palace.

88
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,209
Search thoroughly!

89
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,290
- Understood.
- Understood.

90
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,389
(Jolbon, the fiefdom of Yeon Bi)

91
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:07,268
The King will become more powerful.

92
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,470
So, Your Majesty should visit at once.

93
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,269
Minister Gong Mo was sent instead.

94
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,039
There will not be any problem.

95
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,750
Recall what the current King is like.

96
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,979
Jolbon was not invited to the banquet...

97
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,649
celebrating the King's victory.

98
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,090
He will certainly take issue with it.

99
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,158
Are you suggesting Her Majesty Yeon Bi...

100
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,830
to lower her head to
those who stole our land?

101
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,070
Your Majesty. A letter has
come from Guknaeseong.

102
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,330
(Yeon Bi, Jolbon Authority)

103
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,679
The King...

104
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:25,409
is dead.

105
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,419
Silence.

106
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,690
The King,

107
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,590
who did not die from any swords or arrows,

108
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,730
returned to paradise due to a mere poison.

109
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,100
Since the King has died,

110
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,668
it is our chance to win
back the land Chu Mo took...

111
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,610
from King Yeon Ta Bal.

112
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,149
Yes, You are right.

113
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,220
However, one thing
must be done before that.

114
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:15,398
Prepare my armor.

115
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,399
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

116
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,580
Take the left route.

117
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,779
Your Majesty. Visit
another prince right now,

118
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,119
and we cannot return to the
palace before the approval meeting.

119
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,220
I know.

120
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,470
What is it?

121
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,409
You will not tell me what is going on.

122
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,439
The promise was to the Third Prince.

123
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,079
The promise was to the palace.

124
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,480
But visiting another
prince was not mentioned.

125
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,979
Either give me more money...

126
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,289
or try finding a different
person around here.

127
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:15,979
Where do you think you are going?

128
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,460
Do you want to have a go at me? Do you?

129
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:20,288
Let us do that.

130
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,628
We can lead the way.

131
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,299
Have this man leave.

132
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,830
We cannot do that.

133
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,730
It does not matter right now,

134
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,570
but if the pursuers catch up to us,

135
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,740
only Mo Chi can shake them off.

136
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,570
Head Maid. What should we do?

137
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,450
How much were you promised?

138
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,289
Let me see. How much was it again?

139
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,930
However much it was, you
will be paid twice after your job.

140
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,579
I will gratefully accept such an amount,

141
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,148
but are you sure?

142
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,750
Gosh, thank you.

143
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,148
Goodness. Let us get going, yes?

144
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:19,648
What are you waiting for? Move.

145
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,320
Let us go.

146
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:24,320
You can count on me.

147
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,190
Let us go!

148
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,090
Leave us alone.

149
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,569
(Princess Jwa, Third Prince's Wife)

150
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,750
What brought you here late at night?

151
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,160
Are you still upset...

152
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,529
about what happened a long time ago?

153
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,700
You could have asked His Majesty...

154
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,670
to spare my father.

155
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,569
I wanted.

156
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:50,880
But you know...

157
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,380
what my brother is like.

158
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,920
If I had,

159
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:01,289
we would have gotten killed as well.

160
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:15,700
In any case,

161
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:19,210
I apologize.

162
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,480
Search thoroughly.

163
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,880
Yes, master.

164
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,519
What brought you...

165
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,660
all the way here?

166
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,599
Did any of the maids not act suspiciously?

167
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,500
Why are you...

168
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,670
ransacking the palace like this?

169
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:40,339
This has never happened before.

170
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,079
I am just checking to find
anyone suspicious as usual.

171
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,980
I have served His Majesty for a long time,

172
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,950
but you have never...

173
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,690
stepped in yourself for such a reason.

174
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,359
Did something happen to His Majesty?

175
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,470
Why are you asking about His Majesty?

176
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:12,670
Royal maids like me serve His Majesty.

177
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:16,039
So if someone else
becomes king, we may get...

178
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,309
kicked out of the palace or killed.

179
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
I simply...

180
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,779
want to be prepared.

181
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,890
My lord, Prime Minister
Eul is asking to see you.

182
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,349
The maids who went to serve His Majesty...

183
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,650
were confined in rooms.

184
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,359
And Her Highness was nowhere to be found.

185
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,289
Besides, Mil Woo was looking for something.

186
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,930
It certainly was strange.

187
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:21,170
Why are they not giving any signal?

188
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,750
Your Highness.

189
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,739
Why do you not just
return to the Third Prince?

190
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,598
You know about Father's command.

191
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,729
And if you choose another prince,

192
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,339
the Third Prince will never stay still.

193
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,970
If war breaks out...

194
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,240
I am the Queen of Goguryeo.

195
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,179
If he wants war,

196
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,150
I will fight him myself.

197
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,909
(Head of White Tigers, Noe Eum)

198
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,150
Pa Ya.

199
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,390
(Gal Ro of White Tigers, Noe Eum's son)

200
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,969
They are heading toward the
Amnok River, not the palace.

201
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,669
(Pa Ya of White Tigers)

202
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,670
One more thing.

203
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,639
Another group of people is
chasing the Queen aside from us.

204
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,710
Let us hurry.

205
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,849
We must get her before they do.

206
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,210
Tell me about the decoctions you have made.

207
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,619
Can any of these kill someone?

208
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,629
The guards are searching
all the royal maids' rooms,

209
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,369
but nothing has yet been found.

210
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,299
The real culprit may not be a royal maid.

211
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:06,210
Search every room in this palace.

212
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,750
What is it?

213
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,180
I ran into the Great Shaman on my way here.

214
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,160
Did you say the Head Maid's room?

215
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,430
I thought it was strange
because only her room was there.

216
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:36,799
Could the Head Maid be related?

217
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,769
Keep track of Sa Bi.

218
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:46,880
Are you really going to keep...

219
00:26:47,349 --> 00:26:49,579
the poison from Her Highness?

220
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,490
She will be in worse danger
if others discover it too.

221
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,119
Her safety is what is important.

222
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,359
Our job is to find the culprit.

223
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,869
It cannot be.

224
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,839
Prepare for a ritual.

225
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:20,680
I need to foresee the
King and Queen's fate.

226
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,339
(Hae)

227
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,670
(Hae: Time of the Pig, from 9 to 11 p.m.)

228
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,549
Sky and moon, 99 nights.

229
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,920
The moon in its different
shades for 99 days.

230
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,849
The dark blue moon and
the red sun shine down.

231
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:03,619
Sky and moon, 99 nights.

232
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,459
The moon in its different
shades for 99 days.

233
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,799
The dark blue moon and
the red sun shine down.

234
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,629
The holy sky and moon.

235
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,470
The skies are holy.

236
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:21,140
The skies are the home of souls.

237
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,710
If the Hae Family accepts your suggestion,

238
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,279
you will become the new queen.

239
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,349
Will I become a queen?

240
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,650
Me?

241
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,819
Will I dare...

242
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,359
Is she out of her mind?

243
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,630
This is Chang Heon.

244
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,680
Your Highness, what did you...

245
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,259
You said so.

246
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,299
If I have a wife, the
Queen will not be mine.

247
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
The Jwa Family...

248
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,910
does not have much power anyway.

249
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,578
We need even the smallest
power at this moment.

250
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,809
I just need...

251
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,319
to have the Queen.

252
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,649
Then, Wangdang will follow my command.

253
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,390
That is not enough.

254
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,220
If other families oppose...

255
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,839
There are rats.

256
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,159
It is a maid from the Jwa Family.

257
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,309
She was here to check
Her Highness's safety.

258
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,619
It means the Queen Family is aware...

259
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,390
of your plan to marry the Queen.

260
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,349
Is anyone there?

261
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,000
Cut off all the heads of
Princess Jwa's maids.

262
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,670
If at least one is missing,
I shall cut off your heads.

263
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,279
You are right.

264
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,819
I need more power to
suppress all five families.

265
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,919
Head to the northern region immediately.

266
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,490
I shall own the mounted warriors.

267
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,809
(Asabeol, mounted warriors'
village in the northern region)

268
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,179
Oh, my.

269
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,779
It is all good now. You
went through so much.

270
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,929
We are back.

271
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,565
(Daemodal Dal Ga, the
Chief of Mounted Warriors)

272
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,859
(Head of the Northern Region, Hwa Do Ja)

273
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,380
I guess the mounted warriors
are going to party all night.

274
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,250
You must be tired.

275
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,220
Why do you not head
inside now, Your Highness?

276
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,690
My second brother left this place to me...

277
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,730
so I could watch any possible rebellions.

278
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,959
He commanded us to be
awake as long as they were.

279
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,829
I shall keep this place
until those lights go off.

280
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:43,470
Or Goguryeo will be in danger.

281
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,970
Do you like His Majesty that much?

282
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:50,809
In childhood, I promised
myself when I saw him fight.

283
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,980
He is the man of all men in Goguryeo.

284
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,650
I swore I would follow
him until the day I die.

285
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,589
And he entrusted me with this.

286
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,859
Men of the world like you would not know.

287
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,600
I heard His Majesty was
wary of the mounted warriors...

288
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,740
in case someone uses their mighty strength.

289
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,579
However, we do not necessarily
have to stop that with force.

290
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
Are you asking me to do politics?

291
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,849
The wrong man might
take the throne as the king.

292
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,519
If something bad happens to His Majesty...

293
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,700
That will never happen.

294
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:47,400
Yes, sir.

295
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,839
Our second eldest brother
is stronger than any boulder.

296
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Hey.

297
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:05,679
Send a man to the
palace of the Third Prince.

298
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,760
I must check to see
if my sister is all right.

299
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,690
Who goes there?

300
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:23,170
If the Queen dies, who do you
think the throne will be passed to?

301
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,670
It will obviously be Crown Prince Pae Eui.

302
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:29,539
The former Prime Minister has
made his niece the Crown Princess.

303
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,178
The position of the Queen
will naturally be passed to...

304
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,949
the Myeong Rim family.

305
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,949
Why?

306
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,679
Do you think your son-in-law,
the Youngest Prince,

307
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,389
will have a chance too?

308
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,259
Wake up from that dream of yours.

309
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,429
We are nothing but sidekicks at this party.

310
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,329
Is that not right, Lord Myeong Rim?

311
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,029
Have you forgotten the
reason why the Queen Family...

312
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,300
is made up of five clans?

313
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,400
It is to keep the royal family's
bloodline from becoming muddied.

314
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,369
If the Crown Prince returns,

315
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,280
the position of the Queen
will become our clan's this time,

316
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,210
but after that,

317
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,649
it will be passed to 1 of your 3 clans...

318
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,690
other than our Woo Family.

319
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,389
Right. Then, other than the
young one from the Jwa Family,

320
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,929
if it is 1 of us 2,

321
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
our turns will come faster, will it not?

322
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,669
Spare me!

323
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,238
Spare me!

324
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,139
Spare me!

325
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,849
What are you...

326
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,820
Who are you?

327
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,750
Her Highness, Yeon Bi.

328
00:36:05,769 --> 00:36:07,769
You must be the head of the Yeon Family.

329
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:11,408
We are both descended
from King Yeon Ta Bal,

330
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:13,309
but you are nothing but a semi-barbarian.

331
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:17,349
How dare you try to stand before
me, the descendant of the King?

332
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,659
I kneel before you, Your Highness Yeon Bi!

333
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,349
I heard you sent assassins to the Queen.

334
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:50,179
Take them back.

335
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,320
We, the Northern People, are
no longer the people of Jolbon.

336
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,919
We have not disturbed
one another for a long time.

337
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,889
How dare you interfere with our affairs?

338
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,090
My lord!

339
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,539
Now, will you take them back?

340
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,750
- That is...
- Goodness, my lord!

341
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,749
However, that is already
impossible, Your Highness.

342
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,519
I am sure that by now, the Queen is...

343
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,320
Please take back your command.

344
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,800
I have done everything I can for you.

345
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,400
Now, you must survive on your own.

346
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:44,369
So, do whatever it takes...

347
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,869
to survive, no matter what.

348
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,210
Brother!

349
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,379
Is this not a bit strange?

350
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,900
We do not hear a single bird chirping.

351
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,678
We have seen this once before.

352
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,919
The men from the North were staking out...

353
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,690
when we were doing reconnaissance.

354
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,590
- Let us go faster!
- All right!

355
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,699
Your Highness, I think you
ought to hold onto something.

356
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,159
The carriage might start to waver a little.

357
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,849
Brother, they are assassins!

358
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,610
Take care of the assassins first!

359
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,349
Let us go!

360
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,460
We must capture the Queen!

361
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,639
Let us go!

362
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,110
Protect Her Highness!

363
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,280
Shoot!

364
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,449
Your Highness.

365
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Darn it!

366
00:41:07,909 --> 00:41:08,909
Watch out!

367
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,949
We might all die at this rate!

368
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,190
Let us go!

369
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,559
Will we not go after them?

370
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,409
There is no need to waste our energy.

371
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,170
We are merely hunting a rabbit.

372
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,340
Let us take care of those in the way first.

373
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,610
Yes, sir.

374
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,388
That man who was after Your Highness...

375
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,289
I am certain he was Noe Eum,
the Chief of the White Tigers.

376
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,399
We have escaped him now,
but if they catch up to us again,

377
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,799
I am sure we will get caught.

378
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,599
Wait. Why are the White
Tigers chasing after us?

379
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,199
Why will you not answer me?

380
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,940
There is a small road we could take.

381
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:26,909
Take that path.

382
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,340
But there are no roads
that lead off of that one.

383
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,249
If they chase after us, we
will undoubtedly get caught.

384
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,249
We will only be able to lose
them if we take that path.

385
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,348
In order to get to the Youngest Prince,

386
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:36,618
we must get to the ferry dock.

387
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:38,260
We will not go to the ferry dock.

388
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:39,889
Trust me!

389
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,369
What do I do? Do I take
the other path or not?

390
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:49,400
Do I take the other path or not?

391
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:52,639
Brother!

392
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:56,809
Take the other path!

393
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,219
(The King is dead.)

394
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,529
What is the name of the man
you have hidden in the palace?

395
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,658
I am sorry to inform you, but he
is the man of Lord Myeong Rim.

396
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,530
We do not know who he is either.

397
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,449
I think we have failed.

398
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,590
Thankfully, the Queen has a long life.

399
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,690
You of the Queen's Family were...

400
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,260
originally people of Jolbon, not Goguryeo.

401
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:24,699
However, you have lived as
dogs of Goguryeo all this time.

402
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,630
Choose.

403
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,170
Will you keep following
the descendants of Chu Mo,

404
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,569
who have stolen what was ours?

405
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,210
Or will you follow me,

406
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,309
the descendant of King Yeon Ta Bal?

407
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:46,619
We dedicate our bodies and
souls to the owner of this land!

408
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,899
Send word.

409
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,900
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,259
Does this settle matters?

411
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,730
With Nam Mu's death,

412
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,789
our plans have changed since the beginning,

413
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:31,559
but there will be no more room
for a mere prince to interfere...

414
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:34,630
in his plans to take down
the Royal Family of Go.

415
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:51,219
It is Mi Ryu.

416
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,230
The funeral clothes are ready.

417
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,429
The light from the star is...

418
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:44,269
completely...

419
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,570
It is completely gone.

420
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:01,150
I saw it.

421
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:04,420
The people kneeling before you.

422
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:19,599
Something has gone wrong.

423
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,170
All this time,

424
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:26,679
have I seen the wrong thing?

425
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:59,239
(Work by Director Jeong Se Gyo)

426
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:44,198
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

427
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,939
(and episodes are partially fictional.)

428
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,639
(Even if any are related to
reality, it is by coincidence.)
