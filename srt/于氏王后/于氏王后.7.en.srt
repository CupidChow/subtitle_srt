1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,946
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:03,667
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,306
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:07,363
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,707
(6 years ago)

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,546
- Good grief.
- What is going on?

7
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,747
What did they do?

8
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:21,027
- How horrible.
- Goodness.

9
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,308
Do not look at it.

10
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:27,866
(The head of the northern
Jwa Family, Jwa Ga Ryeo)

11
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:32,828
(The head of the northern
Eo Family, Eo Bi Ryu)

12
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:36,718
Your Majesty.

13
00:00:37,347 --> 00:00:39,827
The Jwa and the Eo
who raised the rebellion...

14
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,108
are a part of the Queen Family.

15
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:44,028
Dethroning the Queen at once...

16
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:47,267
and taking all of the
Queen Family's military...

17
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:48,907
is only proper.

18
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,946
We request earnestly, Your Majesty.

19
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,266
- We request earnestly,
- We request earnestly,

20
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:54,667
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

21
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,588
- We request earnestly.
- We request earnestly.

22
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,867
- We request earnestly.
- We request earnestly.

23
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:21,627
What are you doing?

24
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:22,627
Eo Bi Ryu...

25
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:23,627
- and Jwa Ga Ryeo caused...
- Let go!

26
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:24,706
- The rebellion dogmatically.
- Let go of me!

27
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:26,347
I told you to let go of me!

28
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:28,027
Do you fear nothing, you fools?

29
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:29,987
Take the Queen Family's military first.

30
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:38,547
Put a distance from the Queen for a while.

31
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:43,468
Then, the ministers will soon yield.

32
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,747
Your Majesty used to beat
me when you were young.

33
00:02:56,988 --> 00:02:58,748
But you would always lose.

34
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,827
Did you make losing moves
for His Majesty's sake?

35
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,947
Do not lose on purpose anymore.

36
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:42,028
Read Her Majesty's next move.

37
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:54,107
Her Majesty wrote to move the
left palace elephant to the right front.

38
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:01,748
I gave you the chance to survive.

39
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,148
But why did you make such a decision?

40
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:10,627
Send the horse in the center to the right.

41
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:19,707
Check.

42
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:22,668
My apologies,

43
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:24,918
but Her Majesty...

44
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:28,507
wrote up to five moves.

45
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:45,147
Stop it with the center palace horse.

46
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,668
With the black wagon,

47
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,988
the king is captured.

48
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,507
It is checkmate.

49
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:28,707
Check. It is checkmate.

50
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,946
(Queen Woo)

51
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:11,587
(Episode 7)

52
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,387
There are ghostly fires in between.

53
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,188
Make everyone leave.

54
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:06,467
It was not Song Woo.

55
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,507
The one who used the
eunuchs to assassinate was...

56
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,147
This is mercury.

57
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:28,868
Are you implying the Great
Shaman ordered them?

58
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,428
But why did they kill her?

59
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,228
Someone else must have...

60
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:37,308
given them the elixir.

61
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:50,683
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

62
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:51,908
To the sky we pray.

63
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:54,587
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

64
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,668
To the sky we pray.

65
00:07:58,387 --> 00:07:59,507
To the sky we pray.

66
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:01,347
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

67
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:06,187
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

68
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:08,548
To the sky we pray. Make the land divine.

69
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,067
To the sky we pray.

70
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,107
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

71
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:16,868
To the sky we pray.

72
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,988
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

73
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:21,466
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

74
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,267
- Make the land divine.
- To the sky we pray.

75
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:25,586
Make the land divine.

76
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,587
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

77
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:31,707
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

78
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:35,587
The Queen said we must return
to the palace before sunrise.

79
00:08:35,788 --> 00:08:37,398
But what is taking so long?

80
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:38,668
Your Highness.

81
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,427
Are you truly going to
abandon Her Highness...

82
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:41,827
and accept the levirate marriage?

83
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,866
Even if you become the King,

84
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,028
Prince Bal Gi will not stay still.

85
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,668
Do you not know how scary he is?

86
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,518
Stop listening to Her Majesty the Queen.

87
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:56,308
Like always, let us
think about it together.

88
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,227
Forget it. I will do it myself.

89
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,323
- Your Highness!
- What are you waiting for?

90
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,668
Hurry up with the preparations!

91
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:07,867
- Goodness.
- Move them.

92
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:12,747
Move faster!

93
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:36,278
All seems well.

94
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:39,467
We should be able to return before sunrise.

95
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:42,908
What about my Head Maid?

96
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:45,987
I have Mo Chi watching her just in case.

97
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,227
We must check the road back.

98
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,467
They might have followed us.

99
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,188
- Be sure it is tight.
- I will.

100
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:17,987
- What are you doing?
- Pardon?

101
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,638
Why not help with preparations?

102
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,067
Where did the thing go?

103
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:27,788
I was looking for something.

104
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:31,788
Come over here.

105
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,347
Sure.

106
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:22,067
Was this it?

107
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,628
The reason you came back.

108
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,548
I believed it would not
be you, my own sister.

109
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:48,908
What was it?

110
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:51,947
The reason you betrayed me.

111
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:08,188
Because it was meant to be mine.

112
00:12:14,347 --> 00:12:16,028
It was meant to be mine.

113
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,548
Your clothes. Your ornamental hairpin.

114
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,268
And His Majesty!

115
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:27,028
Everything...

116
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,347
was meant to be mine.

117
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:33,867
I want to take back what was mine.

118
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,227
Is that wrong?

119
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:40,066
It was all mine in the first place!

120
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:43,188
Is that why you tried
to seduce His Majesty?

121
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:48,867
You were always like that.

122
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:53,587
You would refuse something
saying you did not like it.

123
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:56,347
But when you saw I had it,

124
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:58,467
you made me hand it over.

125
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:00,628
Did you...

126
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:02,707
know all along?

127
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,508
I had no idea.

128
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,467
Give me back...

129
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,587
what is mine.

130
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:12,988
Are you sure it was not
my older brother's order?

131
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:14,827
We heard nothing from the royal palace.

132
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,508
And His Majesty just returned.

133
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,388
He would not call the
mounted warriors the next day.

134
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,108
That is not the direction of the palace.

135
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:27,827
What on earth is going on?

136
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,067
It is magic.

137
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,628
Send scouts to the five tribes.

138
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,587
I must know what is happening.

139
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:52,668
How do you think I look?

140
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:54,628
It suits you well.

141
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,388
Have the mounted warriors replied?

142
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:00,388
It should come before sunrise.

143
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:05,548
I just need to obtain the Queen.

144
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:08,747
Why have we not heard from Noe Eum yet?

145
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,188
Is it that hard to catch a woman?

146
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,148
Let us wait a little longer.

147
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,428
How many soldiers can
I send out immediately?

148
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,628
Arming the main army...

149
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,028
will take at least one hour.

150
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,067
Right now, only your
personal guards are ready.

151
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:39,308
I must go to Guknaeseong myself.

152
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:41,707
To the royal palace?

153
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,707
If Noe Eum has failed...

154
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,028
I must capture the Queen myself.

155
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,147
(Third Prince, Fifth Prince)

156
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:55,587
(Queen, Fourth Prince)

157
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:06,078
(Myoshi: The Time of
the Rabbit, 5am to 7am)

158
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:12,787
Prime Minister Eul.

159
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:15,628
The sun will rise soon.

160
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,358
Why is Her Highness not back yet?

161
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,148
There is still time.

162
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:26,227
I sent men to Mount Chilseong.

163
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,908
Her Highness has not passed by yet.

164
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:34,077
If you are planning to make
her and our family traitors...

165
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:35,078
Her Highness...

166
00:17:36,467 --> 00:17:38,027
is with the Fourth Prince.

167
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:02,838
How are preparations going?

168
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:05,467
You can leave whenever you command.

169
00:18:06,027 --> 00:18:09,188
Where is the Head Maid
when she should be helping?

170
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:11,307
This is just madness.

171
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,307
Your Highness.

172
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:17,947
As you thought, Noe Eum
was waiting in the forest.

173
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:32,747
Once they bite, they never let go.

174
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:36,467
Are we doomed to remain here?

175
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:38,747
The people here look
like pathetic fighters.

176
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:40,078
Mo Chi is right.

177
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,078
The men here are not
enough to get through them.

178
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,347
Send a crow to the palace
and request reinforcements.

179
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,628
There is no time for that.

180
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,507
We are not out of options.

181
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:58,787
Where is the Fourth Prince?

182
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:02,108
The White Tigers?

183
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,108
Their presence means...

184
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:08,947
the Third Prince knows the Queen is here.

185
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,188
Your Highness.

186
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,707
Live the way you did so far.

187
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:18,266
If the Third Prince really starts a war...

188
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,358
Enough!

189
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:22,227
Leave me.

190
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:26,027
Leave, now!

191
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,227
Shaman, are you there?

192
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:53,467
Do not worry.

193
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:57,428
The Chief Priest will protect you.

194
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:13,707
(Will enter the palace after
levirate marriage with Queen.)

195
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,747
We were banned from the royal palace...

196
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:24,707
for 30 years now since being
blamed for confusing the former king.

197
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:27,078
We believed Sa Bi's divination...

198
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:29,947
and waited for the time to come.

199
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:32,947
It has come at last.

200
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:36,598
Light the sacred fire!

201
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:40,188
We must offer up a great rite!

202
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,747
Even if this were to work,

203
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,908
the ferry dock is far away.

204
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:08,907
They will get you before you get on board.

205
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:10,427
I only need to reach the ferry dock.

206
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,358
Then Eul Pa So will come.

207
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:13,628
If he does not come,

208
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:16,838
what will you do then?

209
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:18,467
He will be there.

210
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,188
He will.

211
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:44,027
Chief Priest Seol Joo.

212
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:45,306
(Queen, Fourth Prince)

213
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,307
To think that I overlooked her presence.

214
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:51,068
If they beat Bal Gi,

215
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,226
the Chief Priest will
use the Fourth Prince...

216
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,707
to enter the palace.

217
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:58,547
Then she will oust me
so she can gain power.

218
00:21:58,908 --> 00:22:01,466
But once the war with Bal
Gi diminishes their strength...

219
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,668
(Jolbon's Yeon Bi)

220
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:06,547
Whoever wins,

221
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:11,266
as I planned, the Royal
Family of Go will fall...

222
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:13,108
and a new Goguryeo will rise.

223
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:17,828
However, another war will
claim many innocent lives.

224
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:25,668
If not that...

225
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,348
(Queen)

226
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,828
(Queen)

227
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:50,027
Why did you not sacrifice the soldier?

228
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:53,227
If I hide the king and
sacrifice the people only,

229
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:55,108
you cannot say I have truly won.

230
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,987
Are you on my side?

231
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:12,947
Your Majesty, are you also
imagining a new Goguryeo?

232
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:16,747
(Eul Pa So, Queen, Fourth
Prince, Eastern Chief Priest)

233
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:24,868
An inescapable attack.

234
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:34,108
I will make the first move
for the next round too.

235
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,947
(Eul Pa So, Queen, Fourth
Prince, Eastern Chief Priest)

236
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,788
Get ready to mobilize the soldiers.

237
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:45,668
Yes, sir.

238
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,148
The Head Maid...

239
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,188
must have failed.

240
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:22,027
It is the Queen.

241
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,388
I will kill the Queen with my own hands.

242
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,307
Come along!

243
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:32,787
Head to the ferry dock. I
will lure them elsewhere.

244
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:18,124
Thankfully, it looks like they fell for it.

245
00:26:18,148 --> 00:26:19,548
They will track us down in no time.

246
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:21,707
We must hurry!

247
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:41,388
What? They already
managed to track us down?

248
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,267
Keep your eyes ahead, Your Majesty!

249
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,348
Pick up the pace!

250
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:40,507
Darn it. Where is the ferry dock?

251
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:42,388
Where is it?

252
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,706
We must catch them
before they get on the boat!

253
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,428
Shoot!

254
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:05,588
Are you sure Eul Pa So is coming?

255
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:41,747
Over there!

256
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:54,348
Shoot them.

257
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:04,987
Kill them all!

258
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:19,108
Shoot.

259
00:29:35,547 --> 00:29:36,628
Kill them all!

260
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:40,628
Get the fire arrows ready.

261
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:46,547
Shoot!

262
00:29:54,148 --> 00:29:55,348
Your Majesty, this way.

263
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:00,068
Your Majesty.

264
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,986
Escort Her Majesty!

265
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:05,987
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

266
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,668
Kill them!

267
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:27,388
Kill them all!

268
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:21,547
Your Majesty.

269
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,307
Mu Gol!

270
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:29,787
Are you all right?

271
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:34,868
Are you okay?

272
00:32:55,428 --> 00:32:56,947
Noe Eum!

273
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:58,947
Noe Eum.

274
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:58,747
Are you all right?

275
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:24,997
(Jinshi: The Time of
the Dragon, 7am to 9am)

276
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,588
I do not see the Queen Family.

277
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:32,746
They must be fighting amongst themselves...

278
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,588
to decide who should succeed the Queen.

279
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:36,307
Do you think...

280
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:40,517
it is true that Her Majesty
went to the Fourth Prince?

281
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,028
How would I know?

282
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:46,427
It is possible that Eul Pa So lied to us.

283
00:34:51,907 --> 00:34:53,588
Where is Prime Minister Eul?

284
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,477
He should be here shortly.

285
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:58,267
I heard something happened
to His Majesty last night.

286
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:00,427
What happened?

287
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:03,867
Tell us at once.

288
00:35:04,957 --> 00:35:07,108
Her Majesty the Queen is here!

289
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,347
Where is the Head Maid?

290
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:44,387
His Majesty passed away.

291
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:45,907
- What?
- My goodness.

292
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,148
- Is this true?
- Oh, no.

293
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:49,507
- This is not true, is it?
- It cannot be.

294
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,147
- No way.
- I do not believe this.

295
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:57,387
How did His Majesty pass away?

296
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,628
If someone took His Majesty's life,

297
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:02,307
it absolutely cannot go unpunished.

298
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,723
- Absolutely not.
- We ought to...

299
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,427
find out who did it, no matter what!

300
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:07,956
- Yes, we must find out!
- Yes, we must find out!

301
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,957
Before that,

302
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:12,973
we must decide who will succeed
to the throne as soon as possible,

303
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,226
so the five tribes...

304
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,707
- should hold a meeting to...
- That has already been decided.

305
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:23,108
Escort him inside!

306
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,108
It is the Fourth Prince. What should we do?

307
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:51,668
As the Queen, you do not have
the authority to choose a new king.

308
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:53,477
Besides,

309
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:56,387
Bal Gi, the Third Prince,
is next in line to the throne.

310
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,477
- Hence, the Fourth Prince...
- Marrying me...

311
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,826
will make the Fourth Prince
a legitimate successor...

312
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:04,243
to the throne and everything
else that belonged to His Majesty.

313
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:05,427
Through a levirate marriage?

314
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,427
- That is absurd.
- A levirate marriage?

315
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,628
Who says you can do this?

316
00:37:39,347 --> 00:37:42,068
Princes are not allowed to
participate in these meetings.

317
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:43,867
Tell me.

318
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:48,068
Who decided that he
would ascend the throne?

319
00:37:50,028 --> 00:37:51,308
It was His Majesty's dying wish.

320
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,788
This is my first time hearing about this.

321
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:58,387
Eul Pa So.

322
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,347
You tell me.

323
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,627
Between me and the Fourth Prince,

324
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:06,827
who is the rightful
successor to the throne?

325
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:10,386
His Majesty had announced
that his eldest son...

326
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:11,427
would be his successor.

327
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:14,387
But sadly, he passed away without an heir,

328
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,427
so you rightfully are next in
line to the throne, Your Highness.

329
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:24,477
However,

330
00:38:25,957 --> 00:38:27,347
according to Goguryeo's law,

331
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,907
if Her Majesty marries one
of His Majesty's brothers,

332
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:36,628
the person she marries
will ascend the throne.

333
00:38:42,477 --> 00:38:43,683
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

334
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:45,707
choosing a new king
through a levirate marriage...

335
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:48,027
is simply unprecedented
in the history of Goguryeo.

336
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:49,028
Go No Ja!

337
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:51,644
I heard you became the Central Chieftain...

338
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:54,148
through marrying your late brother's wife.

339
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,267
It is what you nobles have been doing...

340
00:38:57,387 --> 00:38:58,787
to protect your wealth and power.

341
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:00,988
Why is it that the Royal
Family cannot do it?

342
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:06,957
Then you tell me.

343
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:12,108
Do you dare to think that you
have the right to sit on the throne?

344
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,307
Well, for me...

345
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:18,477
If you do not,

346
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:21,028
I will drag you down myself.

347
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:22,227
What?

348
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:23,787
Your Highness!

349
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:28,197
No one can unsheathe their
swords in the Royal Palace...

350
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:30,588
except for His Majesty's army, Wangdang.

351
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,427
Do you wish to die?

352
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:46,307
Your Highness.

353
00:39:46,477 --> 00:39:47,787
I suggest you leave for now.

354
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:08,427
Wait and see!

355
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:18,028
I will be sure to turn this
place into a battleground.

356
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:47,628
Prince Yeon Woo is now
the new King of Goguryeo.

357
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,628
Anyone who objects
will be seen as a traitor.

358
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,628
This was His Majesty's last wish.

359
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,547
The royal physician
said poison concocted...

360
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:10,403
from lily of the valley was
what killed His Majesty.

361
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,548
And lily of the valley...

362
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:14,267
was found the Head Maid's room.

363
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:19,957
Where is the Head Maid?

364
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:24,588
The Head Maid...

365
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:27,387
was killed by the White Tigers.

366
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:57,267
See? I told you there was
something fishy about that woman.

367
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:12,028
This is the colour...

368
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:15,788
of the dress you were
wearing the day I first met you,

369
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:17,477
so I got these.

370
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:24,747
No, the colour was different.

371
00:42:25,907 --> 00:42:28,108
Who is this lady you are mistaking me for?

372
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:29,347
No.

373
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,267
It was the colour of this
flower. I am sure of it.

374
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,677
I am truly relieved that you
managed to return safely.

375
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:43,787
Who told them?

376
00:42:44,907 --> 00:42:46,108
Prime Minister Eul...

377
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:49,307
was suspicious of Soon,
believing that the poison...

378
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,188
from lily of the valley was
what killed His Majesty,

379
00:42:52,747 --> 00:42:55,347
so I was afraid you would be suspected too.

380
00:42:56,747 --> 00:42:57,787
The Head Maid...

381
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,668
was coveting my title, so
there is no way it was her.

382
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:06,667
I am certain that the
culprit is someone else.

383
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:09,307
Yes, it has to be.

384
00:43:10,628 --> 00:43:11,827
It must be someone else.

385
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:15,477
But...

386
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:19,188
what happened to Soon?

387
00:44:02,427 --> 00:44:03,427
Are you there?

388
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,708
I need you to do
something for me in secret.

389
00:44:22,508 --> 00:44:24,348
Did you ask her why she
brought Yeon Woo here?

390
00:44:27,907 --> 00:44:29,068
It is still not too late.

391
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:31,084
If she changes her mind
now and chooses Bal Gi,

392
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:32,628
we can protect the family.

393
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,588
Soon...

394
00:44:35,347 --> 00:44:37,227
She died.

395
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:42,787
Just persuade Her Majesty.

396
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,467
I will hand Yeon Woo over to Bal Gi.

397
00:44:45,468 --> 00:44:47,507
Then we can protect the family and...

398
00:44:47,508 --> 00:44:49,386
Soon is dead.

399
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,427
So what?

400
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:55,267
What do you want me to do about it?

401
00:44:57,427 --> 00:45:01,347
It is not like she will come back
to life if we talk about this now.

402
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,988
She is my daughter...

403
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:08,267
and your niece.

404
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:10,747
Both Her Majesty...

405
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:12,387
and Soon...

406
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,907
made so many sacrifices for the family.

407
00:45:26,548 --> 00:45:28,827
When I found out that you had Soon,

408
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:33,267
I castrated myself for
the sake of the family...

409
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:35,028
so that I would not have to...

410
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:36,988
fight with you over the
Crown Princess title.

411
00:45:37,148 --> 00:45:39,707
So, how dare you!

412
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,148
Do not talk about
sacrifices in front of me.

413
00:45:47,988 --> 00:45:49,588
I heard you, so pull up your pants.

414
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,827
If it is for the family,

415
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:57,826
I can and will gladly do evil deeds.

416
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:58,907
So all you have to do is...

417
00:46:01,468 --> 00:46:03,427
Just do as I say.

418
00:46:15,227 --> 00:46:17,067
The coronation ceremony
has not been held yet,

419
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,227
so Your Highness can
still take back the throne.

420
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:21,267
I will mobilize my soldiers at once...

421
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:24,707
and skin them alive, both
Yeon Woo and the Queen.

422
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:27,948
However, the Queen has
Eul Pa So and Wangdang.

423
00:46:28,427 --> 00:46:29,468
First,

424
00:46:30,108 --> 00:46:31,747
you ought to gather more supporters.

425
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:36,508
We are going to the Geopnal Cave.

426
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:46,867
So now,

427
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,308
what do you plan to do, Prime Minister Eul?

428
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:51,628
Knowing the Third Prince,

429
00:46:51,668 --> 00:46:53,668
I have no doubt that he will start a war.

430
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:58,947
Then we will have to prevent
that war from happening.

431
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:04,028
Call a meeting to come up with a plan.

432
00:47:34,907 --> 00:47:36,988
Her Majesty ordered me
to bring Your Highness here.

433
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,628
- My sister-in-law?
- Yes.

434
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:41,628
Very well.

435
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:12,468
The fact that she called
me to her chamber...

436
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:15,467
means she wishes to
spend the night with me.

437
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:19,867
This is not Her Majesty's room.

438
00:48:23,548 --> 00:48:24,548
What?

439
00:48:25,827 --> 00:48:26,827
Guards!

440
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,267
Anybody there?

441
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:31,147
- Guards.
- Guards!

442
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:32,148
Guards!

443
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:35,683
If we have more tribes
supporting us than the Third Prince,

444
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:37,267
he cannot start a war.

445
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:40,468
But before that,

446
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:43,707
we should hold a
coronation for the new King.

447
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,988
(Geopnal Cave, Liaodong,
Crown Prince Pae Eui's Hideout)

448
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:07,988
Kill them all and spare none.

449
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:12,707
How dare you come here with your soldiers?

450
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:39,947
Who sent you?

451
00:49:39,948 --> 00:49:41,547
(Crown Prince Go Pae Eui)

452
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:42,708
Did they send you to kill me?

453
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:44,827
Nam Mu...

454
00:49:45,827 --> 00:49:47,028
is dead.

455
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:39,588
What a shame.

456
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:41,267
I am...

457
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:45,028
hugely indebted to Nam Mu.

458
00:50:49,988 --> 00:50:51,028
You know,

459
00:50:52,387 --> 00:50:55,588
I must...

460
00:50:56,307 --> 00:50:57,827
reclaim the throne.

461
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,747
I will let my lord know.

462
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,588
Listen, get ready for war.

463
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:08,188
- I must reclaim the throne.
- Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,108
You may begin.

465
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:08,668
