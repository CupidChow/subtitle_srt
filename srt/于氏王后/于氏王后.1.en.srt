1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,709
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,310
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:04,709
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,950
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,669
(King Gogukcheon came to
the throne in December, 179.)

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,679
(His wife, Woo So's daughter,
Lady Woo, was crowned queen.)

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,351
(From Goguryeo's Records in
"History of The Three Kingdoms")

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,710
(After the enthronement, Go
Nam Mu starts a long war...)

9
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:30,070
(to reclaim the territories
that were taken away...)

10
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:36,961
(by the Han Dynasty during
the previous king's reign.)

11
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,749
(When the King left to battle,
the palace was sustained...)

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,150
(by the Queen and
Prime Minister Eul Pa So.)

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,310
(But as the King's absence
was prolonged due to war, )

14
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:56,270
(the Western Authority, Hae Dae
Bu, began to covet regal power...)

15
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,510
(under the pretext of state affairs.)

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,869
(In the meantime, the Authority
of the Northern Queen Family, )

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,150
(Myeong Rim Eo Ru, pressured
the Queen for not having a son.)

18
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,709
If you have a strong desire,

19
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,031
you may happen to spot
something within the flames.

20
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,031
What brought you here, woman?

21
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,390
A shop for accessories is that way.

22
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,351
Can you put these together to be one again?

23
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,710
These do not seem ordinary.

24
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,030
Where did you get the pieces?

25
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,630
I heard you were the
best smith in Goguryeo...

26
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,830
and that you could stick
any metal pieces back to one.

27
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,949
Iron swords turn to useless lumps...

28
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,631
if they are not used even for a while.

29
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,911
But bronze swords like this one...

30
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,830
can remain sharp even
after 100 years with rust.

31
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,191
If I remove the rust
and heat up the pieces,

32
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,751
I can easily put them back together.

33
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,151
Come back after about a month.

34
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,950
This is valuable.

35
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,790
Please get it done as soon as possible.

36
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,230
You came after such a long time.

37
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,031
- Come and take a look.
- Goodness.

38
00:03:24,186 --> 00:03:25,585
- Let us go.
- Yes.

39
00:03:26,825 --> 00:03:29,264
We should have caught that darn boar.

40
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,145
- You should have done better.
- Goodness.

41
00:03:31,346 --> 00:03:33,065
Madam, get us more drinks.

42
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,104
- Follow me.
- Yes. Coming right up.

43
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:36,585
I smell money.

44
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:45,745
What is going on?

45
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,066
It is nothing.

46
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,345
What brought you out here, ladies?

47
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:21,145
Give us all you have...

48
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:23,556
before we hurt you.

49
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:28,266
Your skin is as fair as a newborn baby's.

50
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,116
Darn you!

51
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,145
Boss.

52
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,905
Greetings to the Queen.

53
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,145
- What, the Queen?
- The Queen...

54
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:01,065
Spare me.

55
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:04,464
- Please do not kill us.
- Spare us.

56
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:05,825
Please do not kill us.

57
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:07,905
Spare us.

58
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:09,185
Let them go.

59
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,866
Your Highness, a man like him does not...

60
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,464
- Please spare me!
- Do not kill us!

61
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:17,066
(Queen Woo Hui)

62
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:31,904
(Queen Woo)

63
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:36,946
(Episode 1)

64
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:55,465
(The Northwestern
Frontier of Goguryeo in 197)

65
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,144
(The 9th King of Goguryeo, Go Nam Mu)

66
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,306
Mu Gol.

67
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:21,265
How long has it been since
we started battling here?

68
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,866
We have spent two winters...

69
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,625
(Daemodal Mu Gol of Wangdang,
the highest royal forces commander)

70
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:30,025
and three months here.

71
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:34,066
After battling for years
to reclaim the territories...

72
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,706
that were taken from our
previous king from the Han Dynasty,

73
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,345
we only have this land left now.

74
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:56,784
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

75
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:59,746
Always be on alert, understood?

76
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,226
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

77
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:11,106
(Military Headquarters of Goguryeo)

78
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,626
(The Fifth Prince, Go Gye Su)

79
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,106
We are all ready.

80
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,465
The enemy newly deployed
forces. You have big roles to play.

81
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:48,666
Whatever command you give,
we shall follow, Your Majesty.

82
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:02,025
This is going to be a difficult fight.

83
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,306
(Great Shaman Sa Bi)

84
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:53,156
What did the sky deity say?

85
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,785
Today is an auspicious day...

86
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,626
where the sun and earth
meet after eight days.

87
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,946
The sky deity will reveal itself soon.

88
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:01,186
Then, it will be full of the Yang energy.

89
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:05,585
You will certainly get to reclaim
the land that was once taken.

90
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,276
Is that all?

91
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,825
From now on, we will attack
the enemy's headquarters.

92
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,036
(Xuantu Commandery of Han Dynasty)

93
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,625
Fighting to reclaim our land that
was taken by the Han Dynasty,

94
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,225
countless brothers were
killed at the hands of the enemy.

95
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,465
Is anyone here willing to waste...

96
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:03,865
the blood that has been shed for years?

97
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:09,066
Today, we will make sure...

98
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,066
to reclaim what is ours
and return to our hometown.

99
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,786
Brothers!

100
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,825
Are you with me?

101
00:11:41,865 --> 00:11:43,306
Get the troops ready!

102
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,585
Generals, ready!

103
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:25,306
(Guknaeseong, the Capital of Goguyreo)

104
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:44,585
Why are you demanding
to abolish the relief system?

105
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,745
Why?

106
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,505
You know why.

107
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:51,426
Of course, we are concerned
about the Royal House's finances.

108
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,825
The relief system is...

109
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,306
for lending rice to the people
who are short on food in spring...

110
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:58,464
and retrieving it in autumn.

111
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,305
It causes no trouble to
the Royal House's finances.

112
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:01,306
No.

113
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:02,984
(Hae Dae Bu, the Western Authority)

114
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,345
If the country is too
generous toward its people,

115
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,906
they cannot learn to be frugal.

116
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,705
Did they starve to death
because they were not frugal?

117
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,666
They can be frugal...

118
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,745
more than anyone else.

119
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:20,186
One's background
cannot be hidden after all.

120
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:23,585
You should not handle state affairs...

121
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:25,306
so personally like this.

122
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,666
He is right.

123
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,146
Her Highness is here.

124
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:38,266
The relief system will not be abolished.

125
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:53,105
Kneel.

126
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:13,666
This is a state affair.

127
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,905
It is not something the
Queen should meddle with.

128
00:14:16,906 --> 00:14:17,906
Prime Minister Eul.

129
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:20,505
Is he right?

130
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:23,585
While His Majesty is away at battle,

131
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:25,426
the owner of this palace...

132
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,266
is Her Highness herself.

133
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,105
The relief system...

134
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,505
was granted by His Majesty.

135
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:39,105
It will never be abolished.

136
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:02,504
The Queen is the Queen Family's business.

137
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,625
Myeong Rim Eo Ru, you
said you would take care of it.

138
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,224
The Queen's dethronement
is out of our control.

139
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,906
We cannot help...

140
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,145
but wait for the King's return.

141
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,025
What if he does not return?

142
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,266
That is even better.

143
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,306
The King does not have a child.

144
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:20,945
Then one of the King's
brothers will take the throne...

145
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:22,066
or...

146
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,584
like the times when the Go Family
and the Hae Family took turns...

147
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:25,985
sitting on the throne,

148
00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:29,464
you, the other royal family,

149
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:31,066
might have a chance.

150
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,666
Then your family...

151
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:37,186
might become the new Queen Family.

152
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:41,266
Eul Pa So.

153
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,225
Find a way to bring him down first.

154
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:48,744
Goguryeo originally...

155
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,266
belongs to us.

156
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,546
Have you heard from His Majesty yet?

157
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:03,345
It seems this war has been prolonged.

158
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,066
According to the letter,

159
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,786
the enemy changed their strategy.

160
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:19,146
To block the clash, he placed
spearmen and archers in front.

161
00:16:20,306 --> 00:16:22,705
And he placed mounted troops in the back.

162
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,464
At this rate,

163
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,825
the mounted warriors will
be defeated by the enemy.

164
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,146
That is what the enemy would also think.

165
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,546
Do you mean, His Majesty will
enter the enemy lines himself?

166
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,866
Your Majesty, are you okay?

167
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:44,626
Your Majesty!

168
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:50,665
Your Majesty!

169
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,465
- Mu Gol.
- Go!

170
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:57,785
Your Majesty.

171
00:17:58,836 --> 00:18:00,025
Take him down!

172
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,625
Go!

173
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,146
Kill them!

174
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,426
If he makes the mounted warriors
attack the enemy from the side...

175
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,305
Please spare my life.

176
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,985
Please save me.

177
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:16,186
Please save me.

178
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,025
Don't kill me!

179
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,626
Please spare my life.

180
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:25,225
Stop.

181
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,465
No, please.

182
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:29,666
Stop!

183
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,265
In the end,

184
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,745
he shall win.

185
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,265
If you were born a man,

186
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:01,426
you would have been by
His Majesty as his adviser.

187
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,065
Or I would have taken your position.

188
00:21:05,426 --> 00:21:07,465
I am glad you are a woman.

189
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:18,265
However, you are not by his side right now.

190
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,465
His Majesty...

191
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:23,025
would agree with you.

192
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:47,985
The Head Maid is here.

193
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,865
(Head Maid Woo Soon)

194
00:23:51,866 --> 00:23:53,465
(Head Maid, the head of royal maids)

195
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:17,705
I said this is what looks
good on Your Highness.

196
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:20,586
This is what happens when I am not around.

197
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:25,224
What do you think, Your Highness?

198
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:27,626
I am sure His Majesty will like it too.

199
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:38,665
He is back.

200
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:40,106
His Majesty has returned.

201
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:57,305
(The Hours of Monkey, 3 to 5pm)

202
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,704
I cannot believe he won again.

203
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:04,386
In fact, he retrieved the
land the former king lost.

204
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,785
People will look up to him even more.

205
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,225
I plan to tell him...

206
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:13,946
about the new Queen
today for the last time.

207
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:17,666
How have you been?

208
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:27,906
- Hello.
- How are you?

209
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,745
What should we do about Myeong Rim?

210
00:25:31,545 --> 00:25:34,705
He used Eo Family and Jwa
Family's revolt as an excuse...

211
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,626
to take our warriors from the Woo Family.

212
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:40,946
And now, he is trying to
dethrone Her Highness.

213
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:44,145
He will soon bow to us again, brother.

214
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:45,984
- Hello.
- How have you been?

215
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:47,146
Good.

216
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,465
What is the Daemodal
of Wangdang doing here?

217
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:21,106
He asked to be beheaded for
letting His Majesty get injured.

218
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:23,346
Is he out of his mind?

219
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:26,146
He sure is crazy.

220
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:05,865
(Head Secretary Song Woo)

221
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,106
Halt.

222
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:16,504
I heard you were injured.

223
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,265
It was just a graze.

224
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,106
Doctor, you may continue.

225
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:26,465
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,265
Continue.

227
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:04,346
Apply more mint crystals.

228
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:08,346
To cool him down, you must melt it enough.

229
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:26,465
I will staunch it now.

230
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,745
I am glad you are safe.

231
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:41,106
Enough.

232
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:50,305
Get out.

233
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:59,145
How can he keep those filthy
things in front of Your Highness?

234
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:00,826
How could His Majesty do that?

235
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:03,224
Let us go to the Royal Palace.

236
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:05,744
- We must begin the banquet.
- Your Highness.

237
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:07,585
If anyone finds out His Majesty is injured,

238
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,745
those with conspiracy will appear.

239
00:30:33,586 --> 00:30:35,186
You told me...

240
00:30:37,985 --> 00:30:39,705
this was the only way.

241
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:44,186
Is this really the only way?

242
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:47,785
The ministers will hear
about what just happened.

243
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:50,386
To protect Her Highness,

244
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:52,586
you must hold back.

245
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,705
Is that the only reason?

246
00:30:57,186 --> 00:30:59,346
For keeping my distance from the Queen?

247
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:06,505
If you have other thoughts,

248
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:09,386
I will not forgive you.

249
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:14,065
All I want...

250
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:20,305
is to protect Her Highness
like you, Your Majesty.

251
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:48,545
Her Majesty the Queen is here.

252
00:32:18,106 --> 00:32:19,505
Let the banquet begin.

253
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:25,106
Get over here.

254
00:32:32,626 --> 00:32:33,826
Yes!

255
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:35,705
Push!

256
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:37,465
We have good news.

257
00:32:55,545 --> 00:32:57,946
I heard His Majesty was injured.

258
00:32:58,386 --> 00:32:59,826
Is it true?

259
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:02,906
Where did you hear that?

260
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:08,625
If he cannot make it to the
banquet, he must be seriously injured.

261
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:11,224
- Perhaps, did anything go wrong?
- How rude!

262
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,225
But we have heard...

263
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,985
His Majesty the King is here.

264
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,275
Were you talking about me?

265
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,145
Continue.

266
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:41,346
We were only worried about Your Majesty.

267
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,184
What about Jolbon?

268
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,905
Is Jolbon not here?

269
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:55,624
Yeon Bi is not well.

270
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,505
She sent a tribute instead.

271
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,666
Thanks to the sky deity
that looked out for us,

272
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:27,785
I was able to retrieve the land
Han Dynasty took from us...

273
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:29,275
during my father's time.

274
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:32,866
However, many of our soldiers...

275
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,625
were killed by the enemy's sword.

276
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,426
This is...

277
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:41,665
for them.

278
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:39,386
You should return to your chamber.

279
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,755
I will stay here.

280
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:46,386
Do you think they will leave you alone?

281
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:50,185
They are all your subjects.

282
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:53,185
To my eyes,

283
00:36:53,786 --> 00:36:57,104
they are wolves that are waiting
for me to collapse from an injury...

284
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:58,465
so they can bite me.

285
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:04,985
As long as your three
brothers are with you,

286
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:07,665
that will never happen.

287
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:08,985
I agree.

288
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:12,866
As long as the three princes guard...

289
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:15,545
the three tribes' land in
the East, West, and South,

290
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:21,465
they will not dare to challenge the throne.

291
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:32,755
What is Mu Gol doing?

292
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:35,906
He would not give up.

293
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:38,105
Darn it.

294
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,025
I will visit him tomorrow.

295
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:55,024
We have prepared this...

296
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:57,105
to celebrate Your Majesty's victory.

297
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:02,545
We were surprised to hear
that Your Majesty was injured.

298
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:08,064
Because Your Majesty does not
have a son yet, people are worried.

299
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:12,064
You were safe because
the sky deity looked after you,

300
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,785
but if this happens again,

301
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:15,866
and if anything goes wrong,

302
00:38:18,275 --> 00:38:20,866
Goguryeo will have a bloodbath...

303
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:23,235
over the throne.

304
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:27,185
So, as we have said before,

305
00:38:27,786 --> 00:38:30,985
to give birth to a son
who can inherit the throne,

306
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:33,786
please dethrone Her Highness...

307
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:37,905
and marry a new Queen...

308
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,305
Have you forgotten that her
dethronement is up to me...

309
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:42,465
and that you must never mention it again?

310
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:47,715
However, it is our duty...

311
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,386
Leave.

312
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:04,346
Song Woo.

313
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:07,346
What is your opinion?

314
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:11,544
I am sorry to say this,

315
00:40:11,545 --> 00:40:14,145
but Myeong Rim has a point.

316
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:19,025
Your Majesty has shed a lot of blood
to retrieve the land from the enemy.

317
00:40:19,346 --> 00:40:21,865
Now it is time to tighten your position.

318
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,346
Then you will need the
power of the five tribes.

319
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,946
You should not oppose them too much.

320
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:30,426
What governs Goguryeo
is not the five tribes,

321
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,145
but me.

322
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,715
I will handle...

323
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:39,715
the matter with the Queen.

324
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,275
I do not see King Yu Ri's sword.

325
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:03,306
(King Yu Ri, Goguryeo's 2nd King)

326
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:08,185
Descending on your own...

327
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:10,585
may be an option.

328
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:35,024
If His Majesty dies without a son,

329
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,024
who takes the throne next?

330
00:41:37,025 --> 00:41:39,825
It will be one of his brothers
who share the same blood.

331
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:42,306
The Hae Family and the
Go Family might eye it too.

332
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,305
We live in the shade.

333
00:41:46,306 --> 00:41:48,104
Let them fight for the throne.

334
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,065
All we need is the Queen's position.

335
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,786
What does the Hae Family think?

336
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:04,065
Do you not think it is
time for a new Queen?

337
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,145
We will discuss it in the
Jega Conference tomorrow.

338
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,274
If all five tribes agree,

339
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:11,785
His Majesty cannot reject it anymore.

340
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:13,064
The Prime Minister should also be chosen...

341
00:42:13,065 --> 00:42:14,185
through the Jega Conference.

342
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,561
But His Majesty appointed the
man without discussing with us.

343
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:18,585
Do you think he will listen?

344
00:42:18,586 --> 00:42:20,275
We will make him listen to us.

345
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:33,306
It is still cold.

346
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:07,426
Do you want to play after a while?

347
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,715
Allow me to make the first move today.

348
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,185
Then, I will decide the rule.

349
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:26,386
The King has to leave the palace.

350
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,145
Frontline army, two steps forward.

351
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,786
I will send a mounted
troop diagonally to stop it.

352
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:37,386
Then, I will take it with the left
artillery of the nine defences.

353
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:45,024
Before that, should you not
stop the left palace's elephant?

354
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:48,465
The right infantry will block its path.

355
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:51,746
I will move the catapult
to take the infantry.

356
00:43:54,025 --> 00:43:57,266
I will take the catapult
with the frontline wagon.

357
00:44:01,746 --> 00:44:03,306
Would you like to give up?

358
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:09,946
No.

359
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:12,145
Not yet.

360
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,346
There must be a way out.

361
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:24,465
- Do not waver.
- Understood.

362
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,385
What shall we do?

363
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:29,145
Let us keep quiet and watch first.

364
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:40,425
Knowing that His Majesty is alive and well,

365
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:42,826
everyone is contemplating
which side to take.

366
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:45,865
Even if the Queen is dethroned,

367
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,666
it will only do a favour
to the Queen Family.

368
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,425
At this rate,

369
00:44:49,426 --> 00:44:52,706
we cannot win back the
throne the Go Family stole.

370
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:02,266
Get in touch with the hidden one.

371
00:45:06,426 --> 00:45:07,826
The King...

372
00:45:08,746 --> 00:45:10,306
must die.

373
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:34,185
(The palace herbal pot)

374
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:32,306
The ministers want to dethrone you...

375
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:36,985
to take away my power
in ruling this country.

376
00:46:39,306 --> 00:46:40,706
To do so, those men...

377
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:44,065
will come for you and tear you into pieces.

378
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:47,426
However,

379
00:46:50,826 --> 00:46:53,226
I will dethrone you before they do.

380
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:57,946
Go somewhere far away...

381
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,145
to a place where no one can find you.

382
00:47:38,906 --> 00:47:40,226
Did you know?

383
00:47:40,746 --> 00:47:42,945
These birds...

384
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:45,545
serve the very first person
they see upon birth...

385
00:47:46,386 --> 00:47:47,985
as their only master.

386
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:32,665
I will dethrone you before they do.

387
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:35,266
Go somewhere far away...

388
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:39,386
to a place where no one can find you.

389
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,386
I will prepare a horse
and an army of Wangdang.

390
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,226
This is the only way I can...

391
00:48:56,906 --> 00:48:58,226
protect you.

392
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:05,625
You must...

393
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:11,426
protect yourself now.

394
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:24,665
Your Highness.

395
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:27,266
His Majesty...

396
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:29,266
His Majesty...

397
00:49:31,266 --> 00:49:33,065
has passed away.
