00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,429
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,870
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,509
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,750
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,310
It is so nice! It has been so long.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,629
(28 years ago, Goguryeo Dongmaeng Festival)

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,720
Over here.

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,071
- Goodness.
- Do you want to try?

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,470
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

10
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:26,870
(Woo Hui)

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:35,001
Now that I have lifted it,
give me what you promised.

12
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,071
You promised ten iron coins.

13
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:49,631
You seem like a noble
young master. Just get going...

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,351
if you do not want to face anything bad.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,351
Get lost!

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,510
Gosh.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,711
- Oh, dear.
- Hurry.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,110
(Eul Pa So)

19
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,870
- Go away.
- Go.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,070
Get going.

21
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,750
Unbelievable.

22
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:15,149
- Darn it!
- You little...

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,630
What are you doing?

24
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:18,589
- Run!
- Run!

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,670
Run!

26
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,071
Young lady, are you all right?

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,230
Let me escort you.

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,150
Step away.

29
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,991
Your Highness, His
Majesty is looking for you.

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,390
Mil Woo.

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,750
Do you know whose daughter she is?

32
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,071
She seems to be from
the Northern Woo family.

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,230
(8 years later at the camp
of the Northern Woo family)

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,881
My gosh.

35
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,830
Admit your defeat now.

36
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,829
I wonder what she will become.

37
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,911
Right, nanny?

38
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,990
I said I would become a general.

39
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:28,390
Gosh.

40
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,950
You are a woman. You should
prepare to get married for your family.

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,031
Nanny, will the Crown Prince like it?

42
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,110
If you become a general,
we will follow your command.

43
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:43,870
If she is dreaming of something
impossible for a woman,

44
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:47,110
it might be better to nip the bud.

45
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,550
Young lady!

46
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,751
Where did she go this time? Young lady!

47
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,471
Goodness. Young lady!

48
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,351
I told you. Marriage is not
something you can do as you please.

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,669
Still, the second prince is
the best warrior in Goguryeo.

50
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,830
But I will not be able to become a queen.

51
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,591
Besides, I will have to
live in that freezing region.

52
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,926
I would rather choose to die
if not with the Crown Prince.

53
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,191
Fine. If that is what you think...

54
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,590
What are you doing?

55
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:41,191
No one can disobey a marriage with royalty.

56
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,510
You are aware of it too.

57
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,351
The Myeong Rim family has
taken the Crown Prince anyway.

58
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,070
We have been given the
second son who will never be king.

59
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:50,390
Do you not get why?

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,590
If we refuse, it will
be considered treason.

61
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,031
And they will annihilate our Woo family.

62
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,190
That is what the father and son
of the Myeong Rim family want.

63
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:02,269
For our family to survive, she must die.

64
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,791
No.

65
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,470
I am the head of the family.

66
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:07,510
Move.

67
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,911
I will do it.

68
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,841
On my older sister's behalf,

69
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,630
I will marry the second prince.

70
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:35,351
(Northern Region of Goguryeo)

71
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,109
According to what soldiers
say, he is like a monster.

72
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,151
I am aware of it.

73
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:54,550
She is here.

74
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:06,989
Welcome.

75
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,190
(The Second Prince, Go Nam Mu)

76
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,151
I must protect this region.

77
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,550
So although you are a princess,

78
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:05,751
you may have to live here with
me in the cold Northern regions...

79
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,750
without getting to go to the
palace for the rest of your life.

80
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,831
I like it better here.

81
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:33,510
(Queen Woo)

82
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:38,550
(Episode 2)

83
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,471
(An hour before the King's death)

84
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,070
It is mugwort, chrysanthemum, and mint.

85
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,151
The Queen asked me to
prepare this bath for you.

86
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,590
What are you doing?

87
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,069
I just want to help your bath...

88
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,070
Get out.

89
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,430
Get out.

90
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,391
Why would His Majesty not have me?

91
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:37,031
As long as that woman exists,

92
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,710
there will be no place for you.

93
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:48,350
Do you want His Majesty?

94
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,470
I do.

95
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:02,710
I want him.

96
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,670
I want him so much! So much...

97
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:22,391
It is a love potion. It can
make anyone fall in love.

98
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,590
If you want something,

99
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,950
you must pay the price.

100
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,470
What do you want? I will
give you anything you want.

101
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,241
Make me a Chief Priest.

102
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,350
A Chief Priest?

103
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,550
Well...

104
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,751
That is...

105
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:51,751
That is not something I can do.

106
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,631
When you become a queen,

107
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:02,631
tell His Majesty just one word.

108
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,151
One drop of this...

109
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:08,670
is enough to make him want you.

110
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,151
Tell him it is from the Queen.

111
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:32,631
It will take some time
for the potion to work.

112
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,151
This is a decoction made with mercury.

113
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,111
It will make your skin fair like the Queen.

114
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:50,070
Will I get to become a queen too?

115
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,350
Did I not tell you?

116
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,111
I have seen the people kneel before you.

117
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,991
You better hurry now.

118
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:07,310
If you are late, His Majesty
may want someone else.

119
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,151
Your Majesty, I will
grind the medicinal herbs.

120
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,550
Your Majesty!

121
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,590
Your Majesty!

122
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
Your Majesty!

123
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,350
Your Majesty!

124
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,350
Your Majesty.

125
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:55,511
Your Majesty!

126
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,991
His Majesty is...

127
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:17,031
You must hurry up and
call the royal physician.

128
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,231
He has already...

129
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,391
passed away.

130
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,991
This is Eul Pa So.

131
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,511
Your Majesty!

132
00:16:56,631 --> 00:17:00,111
Please open your eyes, Your Majesty!

133
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:08,630
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

134
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:24,961
Your Majesty.

135
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,109
Your Majesty!

136
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,910
Please open your eyes.

137
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,869
You still have so much to do, Your Majesty.

138
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,550
Please wake up.

139
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,961
Your Majesty!

140
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,310
Should we inform the others?

141
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,830
No. Not yet.

142
00:18:12,711 --> 00:18:14,110
Make sure no one else finds out.

143
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,390
Tell only Her Highness.

144
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,150
Yes, my lord.

145
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:40,110
Please wake up, Your Majesty.

146
00:18:55,961 --> 00:18:56,961
Your Highness.

147
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,231
His Majesty...

148
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:03,110
has passed away.

149
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,110
Where is the Great Shaman?

150
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:38,031
Where is she?

151
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,310
One drop of this...

152
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:31,711
is enough to make him want you.

153
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:44,350
Father.

154
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:28,991
Your Highness.

155
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,791
What are you doing? Escort her right now.

156
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:42,751
What happened to him?

157
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:44,681
We do not know yet.

158
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,671
Is it not obvious?

159
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,471
The wound was too deep.

160
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,031
His Majesty has died.

161
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,830
The treatment might have gone wrong.

162
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:25,711
Or someone might have harmed him.

163
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,550
Investigate thoroughly.

164
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,629
What will happen to us now?

165
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,951
His Majesty's death...

166
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,031
is the death of the Woo Family.

167
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,031
He left without a son.

168
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:03,710
So his younger brother, Third
Prince Bal Gi, will take the throne.

169
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,310
His wife...

170
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,389
is the daughter of Jwa Ga Ryeo,
the former head of the Jwa Family,

171
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,070
who rebelled against the
King and was killed by him.

172
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,191
That means...

173
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,271
if Bal Gi becomes the king...

174
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,711
The blade of vengeance against
the late King will turn to our family.

175
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,150
None of us will survive.

176
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,030
But what is worse than that...

177
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,231
is Pae Eui, the Crown Prince
who lost to the late King,

178
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,309
and was banished is coming back.

179
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,671
That is enough.

180
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:36,390
His body is not even cold yet.

181
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,471
Do you have to say something like that?

182
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,751
I understand how you feel, Your Highness,

183
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,671
but we need to find a way to survive first.

184
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:51,590
As for the army, we have Wangdang.

185
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,191
They swore allegiance not only
to the late King but also to you.

186
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,069
Since the King has passed away,

187
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,030
they will follow the new king.

188
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:02,630
What do we do, then?

189
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:05,870
Is there really no way
to save Her Highness?

190
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,110
Run away.

191
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,191
You will survive, then.

192
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:21,630
I will prepare the soldiers
to escort you safely.

193
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:30,910
Is there no other way?

194
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:44,630
When a man dies,

195
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,110
his younger brother takes
his position and his wife.

196
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:53,431
That is how the nobles
protect their power and property.

197
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,910
Levirate marriage is another way.

198
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,231
Are you saying...

199
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,430
we should make Her Highness
marry the late King's brother?

200
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,471
Who?

201
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,471
Bal Gi, the Third Prince.

202
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,950
That is impossible. He is a savage.

203
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,870
No. The ministers would have no reason...

204
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,191
to oppose the levirate marriage.

205
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,390
We, the Woo Family,

206
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:24,231
will be able to protect our status
as the Queen Family as well.

207
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,070
But do you think the Crown
Prince, the eldest son, will stay still?

208
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,231
He will definitely return...

209
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,790
and claim his right to the throne.

210
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:36,191
That is why she must
marry the Third Prince.

211
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:37,991
Because...

212
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:40,751
he will be able to stop the Crown Prince.

213
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:43,590
The Third Prince...

214
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,471
has no reason to reject the
marriage with Her Highness either.

215
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:50,390
He needs justification.

216
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:52,511
Everyone, get out.

217
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,790
Your Highness, please run away.

218
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,231
You know the rumours
about the Third Prince.

219
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,230
Fortunately, the Prime
Minister can prepare soldiers.

220
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:19,549
You can leave anytime.

221
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,471
I will escort you, so...

222
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,031
What is it?

223
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,031
What are you hiding from me again?

224
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:38,710
Whenever you were about
to get scolded by Father...

225
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:39,711
when you were little,

226
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,951
you would always make that face.

227
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,150
I was just...

228
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:48,630
worried about Your Highness.

229
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,951
This is the only way.

230
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,590
The ministers will definitely
ask about the death of the King.

231
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:30,590
Someone will have to take responsibility.

232
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,309
We made the royal physician
and the maids gather in a room.

233
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,670
Lock the royal physician in prison...

234
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:44,590
and arrest everyone who
went to the King's chamber.

235
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,751
Nobody should know about this yet.

236
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,951
Move quietly.

237
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,951
This is the only way I can...

238
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,870
protect you.

239
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,070
You must...

240
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,671
protect yourself now.

241
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,791
I will marry his brother.

242
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,110
- Your Highness.
- Eul Pa So.

243
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,471
We cannot hide the King's death anymore.

244
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,670
You must meet the Third Prince tonight.

245
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:39,869
Her Highness does not
need to visit him herself.

246
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,870
Yes, she needs to.

247
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:43,511
We are talking about the death of the King.

248
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:47,070
He will not believe it unless
it is from Her Highness.

249
00:29:47,511 --> 00:29:49,630
You must return with the Third Prince...

250
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,751
before the Jega Conference
takes place tomorrow.

251
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:55,069
The sun will set soon.

252
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,310
How can we send her outside
the palace? It is dangerous.

253
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:01,711
What if she is attacked
by bandits or animals?

254
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,711
There is someone who will protect her.

255
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,191
He was trusted by His Majesty.

256
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,751
But still...

257
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,350
Please get it ready.

258
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,070
Which maid gave you the alcohol?

259
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:58,630
Tell me who it was.

260
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,671
It was her.

261
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:08,910
Drag her out.

262
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:11,590
Why are you doing this?

263
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,590
Why are you doing this?

264
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:15,350
What is going on?

265
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,150
Why are you doing this?

266
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:24,270
Wait. Why are you doing this?

267
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:26,670
Please tell me why.

268
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,271
Oh, gosh!

269
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:32,389
I am not supposed to be here. Excuse me.

270
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,910
Wait. Hey!

271
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,910
Why am I here?

272
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,511
His Majesty has passed away.

273
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,511
Did you forget his order?

274
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:36,030
He must have told you to protect
Her Highness with the sword...

275
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:37,630
if something happened to him.

276
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,310
Tonight, the Queen...

277
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,630
will leave the palace to visit Bal Gi.

278
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,431
Her Highness intends to marry him.

279
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,231
It is to protect herself...

280
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:55,830
from His Majesty's enemies.

281
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:02,951
Protecting Her Highness
is protecting the country.

282
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,191
Please protect her.

283
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,751
I need someone.

284
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,350
- Have a drink.
- This is good.

285
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,750
Give me some more.

286
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:53,231
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink.

287
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,230
- Yes.
- Nice.

288
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:57,951
Fine. I am betting more.

289
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,630
What?

290
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,870
- It is not too late to die.
- No way.

291
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,589
Not a chance.

292
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,030
Do you know how much
I offered to the deity?

293
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:10,791
Come on, deity. Please.

294
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,990
Let me win for once, please.

295
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,231
Let me win.

296
00:34:16,631 --> 00:34:20,429
I won. Darn it, I won!

297
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,390
- What is this?
- I won. Oh, dear deity.

298
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,430
What is this doing here?

299
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,120
You jerk!

300
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:33,350
- Stupid swindler.
- Come here!

301
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,029
Get that swindler.

302
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,559
Do not miss him.

303
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,710
Come here, you jerk!

304
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:41,191
Come back here!

305
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,711
Darn it.

306
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,230
Get out of my way!

307
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,429
- There he is!
- Get him!

308
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,429
- Move.
- You swindler.

309
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,469
Where do you think you are going?

310
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,270
Get him.

311
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:57,309
Come back here.

312
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,829
Get that swindler.

313
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,870
You darn swindler.

314
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:05,711
Darn it.

315
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,509
He is here.

316
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,309
- Get him.
- The door!

317
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,509
- Where did he go?
- Darn it.

318
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,751
Not so fast.

319
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:17,469
Oh, darn it.

320
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,829
What are you doing here?

321
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,030
- Get out!
- Gosh.

322
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:22,711
Seriously.

323
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,231
What was that?

324
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,030
- Where did he go?
- Where is he?

325
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:31,079
- He got away.
- Find him!

326
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,791
- Find him.
- You are coming with me.

327
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,350
What is with you?

328
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,079
- What do you want?
- What are you doing?

329
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,119
- Hurry up and find him.
- Come here.

330
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,510
That was close.

331
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:45,271
Oh, no.

332
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,950
What? Mu Gol?

333
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,631
You are still alive.

334
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,151
And your skills are still good.

335
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,630
What are you doing here?

336
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,231
Do you frequent this kind of place now?

337
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,429
I need a horseman to serve Her Highness.

338
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:10,711
To the Third Prince's
palace, Hwaninsoo, tonight.

339
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,029
Why would I do it?

340
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,429
Darn it. Have you forgotten
that you kicked me out?

341
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,869
I am no longer a member
of Wangdang. I will not do it.

342
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,910
Forget it.

343
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,949
How much will you pay me?

344
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,150
I need a lot of money.

345
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,630
- As much as you want.
- Get moving.

346
00:36:29,631 --> 00:36:31,560
Which way is it? Here?

347
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,711
How much should I ask for? Hurry up.

348
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,600
I heard you asked the blacksmith...

349
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,271
to repair the broken sword
King Chu Mo left for King Yu Ri.

350
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,671
It is the holy sword...

351
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,389
that will connect the Go Family
and the Hae Family together.

352
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,080
If His Majesty had it, he would
have been able to unite all five tribes.

353
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:02,310
Although that is no longer possible.

354
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,310
Fly away.

355
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,310
I did not expect you to
choose levirate marriage.

356
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,990
A woman like me...

357
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,869
has to move like these chess pieces...

358
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,271
for her family.

359
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,430
If I cannot avoid it,

360
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:46,271
I would rather take the path I chose.

361
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,990
The Third Prince is known for
being as cruel as the Crown Prince.

362
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,751
It may be harder than dying.

363
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,671
Are you on my side?

364
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,271
I wrote my next move here.

365
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,120
You should think about yours.

366
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:52,120
I will finish playing when I return.

367
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,271
Pack that too.

368
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:56,390
For once

369
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,390
What should I do when I get paid?

370
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,310
Mu Gol, are you going to a battle or what?

371
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,310
What are all those weapons for?

372
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:18,430
What happens if the Third
Prince does not accept it?

373
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:25,600
Her Majesty the Queen is here.

374
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,151
You look familiar.

375
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,030
I am Daemodal Mu Gol of Wangdang.

376
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,910
- What are you doing?
- I am Mo Chi.

377
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:01,711
Everyone will know about His
Majesty's death by tomorrow morning.

378
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:03,711
You must return...

379
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,271
to the palace with the
Third Prince before that.

380
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,390
Now, our family's destiny
lies with your sister.

381
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,430
Force her to sleep with the Third Prince...

382
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,191
if necessary.

383
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,470
No one shall know about this.

384
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:16,151
Do not let anyone leave
the palace until the morning.

385
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:12,751
Close the gates!

386
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,631
(The Hours of Rooster, 5 to 7pm)

387
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,750
I have locked the gates...

388
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,870
and placed Wangdang
soldiers in and out of the palace.

389
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,591
Who would have known he would die in vain?

390
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,389
His Majesty would...

391
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,030
never give in to an injury like this.

392
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,350
Do you think it was the injury?

393
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:02,751
I beg your pardon?

394
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:29,910
This is...

395
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,670
The chickens died after eating rice.

396
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:35,391
(The chicken method, Checking
for poisoning by feeding chicken rice)

397
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:39,030
He was poisoned.

398
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:05,710
Prime Minister Eul,
please get me out of here.

399
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:07,469
I do not know why I was dragged here.

400
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,390
Please help me.

401
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,591
His Majesty was poisoned to death.

402
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:24,711
It was not me.

403
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:31,111
Do you wish to live?

404
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,310
Yes.

405
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,151
Then find the culprit.

406
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:59,111
Tell me about my destiny.

407
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:22,990
Halt.

408
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,551
I waited to catch them as you ordered,

409
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,030
but I missed one.

410
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,830
I have checked them thoroughly,
but they were all the same.

411
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,551
Do you think it was a trick?

412
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:41,990
Writing with vinegar.

413
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:44,950
What does it say?

414
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:47,389
(The King is dead.)

415
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,310
(The Queen wants to marry the
Third Prince. An assassin is needed.)

416
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,429
There seems to be a spy who is in touch...

417
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:06,751
with people outside the palace.

418
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,551
How outrageous.

419
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,870
Do you have anyone in mind?

420
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:16,671
I do not know yet. However,

421
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,071
if His Majesty's death becomes known,

422
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,430
someone will make a move soon.

423
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:33,990
Her Highness...

424
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,390
might be in serious danger.

425
00:48:56,631 --> 00:49:00,751
(Directed by Jeong Se Gyo)

426
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,349
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

427
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,029
(and episodes are partially fictional.)

428
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,630
(Even if any are related to reality, )

429
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:50,830
(it is by coincidence.)
