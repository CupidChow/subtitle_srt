1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,759
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,240
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:04,599
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,840
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
(3 years ago)

6
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:10,640
(Goguryeo army's headquarters
in the northern border region)

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,161
(The 9th King of Goguryeo, Go Nam Mu)

8
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,080
Have you heard?

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,760
Myeong Rim is taking issue
with His Majesty's inability...

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,840
to produce offspring and
asserting dethronement.

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,041
It is certainly a trick...

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,999
to steal our title as the Queen Family.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,449
We simply have to
stop him from stealing it.

14
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,920
But there is no way to do it, is there?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,321
If it is to protect the title
as the Queen Family,

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
there is a way.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,881
Our Woo Family...

18
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,279
has another daughter.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,360
(Head Maid Woo Soon)

20
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:42,000
(Great Shaman Sa Bi)

21
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:45,360
Will His Majesty accept it?

22
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,560
I have already made preparations for it.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,851
He will not be able to
wake up for the time being.

24
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,041
(Head Secretary Song Woo)

25
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,281
I missed you.

26
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,521
Hui.

27
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
Your Majesty.

28
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,081
- Last night...
- Who ordered you to do it?

29
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,161
I am keeping you alive simply because...

30
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
you are the Queen's sister.

31
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:26,360
If I see you again here,

32
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,041
I will have you beheaded.

33
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,760
(Queen Woo)

34
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:11,081
(Episode 5)

35
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,401
Wait.

36
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,920
One party is trying to kill us,

37
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,280
and the other party is trying to kill them.

38
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,681
(Former Wangdang's horseman Mo Chi)

39
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,360
Darn it.

40
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,961
Big brother. You know, do you not?

41
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,600
The White Tigers.

42
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:40,601
They will never lose
their catch once caught.

43
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,119
Good grief. Really.

44
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,521
(Daemodal Mu Gol of Wangdang)

45
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:00,440
(White Tigers Pa Ya)

46
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,721
Over there.

47
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,560
They are taking the side road to Baeuitu.

48
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,920
They are like rabbits squirming to survive.

49
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:25,601
- Gal Ro.
- Yes, Father.

50
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:28,281
It is your chance to show the
tribesman what you are capable of.

51
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,799
Take the lead.

52
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
(White Tigers Gal Ro, Noe Eum's son)

53
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:37,801
I will catch her no matter what.

54
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,041
Let us go!

55
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,080
Bow.

56
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Rise.

57
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:52,839
(Prime Minister Eul Pa So)

58
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,761
Those who know His Majesty have died.

59
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,491
Among them, there is a spy.

60
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:02,080
He must have ordered the poison.

61
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,680
It is not Mil Woo.

62
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,680
He always assisted me.

63
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Besides, His Majesty could not
afford to lose him and had him...

64
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,960
serve me instead of leaving
Wangdang due to an injury.

65
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,440
He has no reason to betray His Majesty.

66
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
Do we have no news from Her Majesty?

67
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,920
She should have arrived by now.

68
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:29,840
It could not be them, either.

69
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,600
As much as they want power,

70
00:10:34,761 --> 00:10:37,491
His Majesty's death will play
unfavourably to the enemy.

71
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:40,521
Not yet.

72
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
However, Woo Do.

73
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,560
He could be...

74
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,481
This man is most suspicious.

75
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,881
Head Secretary Song Woo.

76
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,361
But why?

77
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,281
Bow.

78
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,361
Rise.

79
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Let us leave.

80
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
I wonder how this could have happened.

81
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,800
Have you found a
suspect, Prime Minister Eul?

82
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,761
The one who wrote the letter...

83
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,001
could be the man who murdered His Majesty.

84
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,001
Is that so?

85
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,680
(Eastern Temple Sabaegol)

86
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,839
Make the land divine.

87
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,536
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

88
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,281
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

89
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:34,761
(Chief Priest Seol Joo)

90
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,960
To the sky we pray.

91
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,559
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

92
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,719
(Sa Gu, Sa Bi's father,
the Eastern Authority)

93
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,799
To the sky we pray.

94
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,919
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

95
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

96
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,439
To the sky we pray.

97
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,240
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

98
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,319
Make the land divine.

99
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,121
- Make the land divine.
- Make the land divine.

100
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,840
It is from the hidden one, Chief Priest.

101
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,041
Sa Bi.

102
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:14,361
Have you seen it?

103
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:16,840
I have.

104
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:21,840
I saw the Fourth Prince rise to the throne.

105
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,401
- Mal Woo.
- Yes?

106
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,881
Inform all the faithful at the palace...

107
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:40,560
that the time has come.

108
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,481
Understood.

109
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Through Sa Bi's eyes,

110
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,361
I saw our time would come again.

111
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,079
So, trust in it!

112
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

113
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,959
The time of the stars will soon come!

114
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,400
To the sky we pray.

115
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:18,000
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

116
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,959
To the sky we pray.

117
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,520
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

118
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,360
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

119
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,160
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

120
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,160
To the sky we pray.

121
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,361
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

122
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,161
I am not certain if Her
Majesty arrived safely.

123
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
If Bal Gi refuses...

124
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,481
What then?

125
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,881
Who in the world killed His Majesty?

126
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:07,361
Putting that aside,

127
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,761
should we not get rid of...

128
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,281
Eul Pa So...

129
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:17,361
in preparation for when they return?

130
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:24,080
After we make Bal Gi the King,

131
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:28,881
we should win back our family's
power again, should we not?

132
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Eul Pa So.

133
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:43,200
Acting all clean on the outside,

134
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,481
he is wicked on the inside.

135
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:56,560
We do not know his plan.

136
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,680
It is too early to make a move.

137
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,691
Have you found anything?

138
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,599
(Royal Physician, Yak Gwang)

139
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,211
We found nothing.

140
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,761
Did you say the poison
was the lily of the valley?

141
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,961
Yes, Head Secretary.

142
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,360
Now that I think about it, I
remember seeing that flower.

143
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,560
Let us see.

144
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:03,840
Is it?

145
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,011
It is certainly the lily of the valley.

146
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:11,001
Chief Commander, I found it.

147
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,931
Darn it.

148
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,931
I will examine the road first.

149
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Look around.

150
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,839
If you hear any hooves, shoot mercilessly.

151
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,931
Split up.

152
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,400
Your Majesty. We will soon
reach the road to Baeuitu.

153
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,159
The road to the ferry dock is narrow.

154
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,000
We can eliminate each
enemy if they follow us.

155
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,240
However, the enemy can surround
our carriage on the Baeuitu road.

156
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,840
With not enough men, we will get caught.

157
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,761
Keep going.

158
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:33,450
There are only three hours until sunrise.

159
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,961
There is no time to lose now.

160
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,241
It is safer to go to the
ferry dock than Baeuitu.

161
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:39,451
Your Majesty.

162
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,977
Taking the carriage will get us
caught before reaching the dock.

163
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:45,559
As Father ordered, we should
return to the Third Prince.

164
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,451
Have you not heard of the Baeuitu's legend?

165
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,280
We are to go to Baeuitu one way or another.

166
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,640
Only then can we stop the
enemy from chasing after us.

167
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:19,520
Yu Hwa, hush.

168
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:20,690
Let us run away. Come with me.

169
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:22,880
- What do you think you are doing?
- Hush.

170
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:26,520
Did you not see the White Tigers earlier?

171
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:28,931
You have no idea how
horrifying they are, do you?

172
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,241
Hold on. Give me a minute.

173
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,721
Listen to me first, all right?

174
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:37,119
You see, fighting them is useless.

175
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,281
We will all get killed once caught.

176
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
I already received some money.

177
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,320
Put your faith in me, and follow me.

178
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,720
Yu Hwa. Come this way.

179
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,241
Come on.

180
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,451
For goodness' sake.

181
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,840
All torches have been put off.

182
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,320
How do you think the
Third Prince found out?

183
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,880
Only we are aware of the reformation.

184
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,481
He might have found out
through the palace's hidden one.

185
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,931
We should not go any further.

186
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,241
Why am I not getting a
message from Hae Dae Bu?

187
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:40,560
Have you not seen Mo Chi?

188
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,120
Darn it.

189
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,359
I do not have time to pee.

190
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
Really. What is it?

191
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,921
What?

192
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:52,880
Let us go. Come now.

193
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,441
Get ready.

194
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,921
Understood.

195
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:11,921
Let us do this.

196
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,241
(Baeuitu)

197
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:51,961
Let us go.

198
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,721
Do not stop. Keep going.

199
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Big Brother. Why must
we get a fire going...

200
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:01,200
when there is not a soul
on this road every night?

201
00:23:01,201 --> 00:23:02,521
Have you not heard...

202
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,880
of when Liaodong invaded us?

203
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,920
Do you mean the one of King
Daemusin defeating them all?

204
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,119
Even babies...

205
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,000
in Goguryeo know that story.

206
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,879
The Liaodong jerks...

207
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,681
took this road to Guknaeseong back then.

208
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:20,600
Then we should keep it pitch black.

209
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,799
Why must we light the torches?

210
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,721
Are we giving people a warning or what?

211
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:27,680
You fool!

212
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:30,000
Only then can we catch
if the enemy is coming!

213
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,001
I see.

214
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,441
Do your work without complaining.

215
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,561
Make a mistake, and it
will be the end of Goguryeo.

216
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,400
Understood?

217
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,441
- Yes.
- Come now.

218
00:24:19,241 --> 00:24:20,921
Where is the Head Maid?

219
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:24,320
The Head Maid... Here she is.

220
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:27,800
I am sorry. I had to
avoid drawing attention.

221
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:31,681
Why do you not just
return to the Third Prince?

222
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,241
You know about Father's command.

223
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,440
Seriously, my wish...

224
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,079
was to die in battle if we lost,

225
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,800
not die in vain like this. Darn it.

226
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,201
Listen, Big Brother. Am I not right?

227
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
I only needed to drive the carriage, no?

228
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,001
As if kicking me out of
Wangdang was not enough,

229
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,681
must you kill me as well? Really.

230
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,481
Gosh.

231
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:08,160
- Mo Chi.
- What is it? What?

232
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,681
His Majesty...

233
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,320
has passed away.

234
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,840
(Jashi: The Time of the Rat, 11pm to 1am)

235
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,281
It smells of a Persian silk tree.

236
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,721
It is likely the same potion
found in the acupuncture room.

237
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,921
Do you think the Head Maid is the culprit?

238
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,840
Someone must have made
the poison with the flower.

239
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,801
Let us go to the acupuncture room.

240
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,120
There are both Persian silk trees
and dried buckwheat flower powder.

241
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,761
The potion was certainly made here.

242
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,961
You may leave.

243
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,481
Tell me.

244
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,721
Did you give the Head Maid
drugs other than this one?

245
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,640
Prime Minister Eul asked you a question.

246
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Answer him.

247
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:10,120
Why did you approach the Head Maid?

248
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,721
Was it the Chief Priest's order?

249
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,560
The Chief Priest...

250
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,001
took hostage of me...

251
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,521
and made my father into her puppet.

252
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,600
- Gosh.
- Good grief.

253
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:36,201
Why did you give this
potion to the Head Maid?

254
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:42,201
You know well, do you
not, Prime Minister Eul?

255
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,201
What she wants.

256
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:49,001
I simply helped her with it...

257
00:28:51,961 --> 00:28:54,441
and was promised something small.

258
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,880
And what was that?

259
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,721
Take her.

260
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
I will interrogate her myself.

261
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Mil Woo.

262
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,521
Go ahead. I will take care of them.

263
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:43,721
Let us go.

264
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:32,800
Are you all right?

265
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:02,600
Who ordered you to approach the Head Maid?

266
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,800
Though I read others' fates,

267
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:15,600
I could not read mine.

268
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,800
The last star of Sungtaeseong...

269
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,840
must have been me.

270
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:36,080
Prime Minister Eul.

271
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,560
Her...

272
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,961
Her Majesty...

273
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,001
It is my fault.

274
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,801
Are you all right, Prime Minister Eul?

275
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,601
What brings you here at this hour?

276
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I left out of the habit
of visiting His Majesty.

277
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,521
They were those who
served you and His Majesty.

278
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:44,721
How did this happen?

279
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,840
Someone must be behind it.

280
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,241
Wishing I would die.

281
00:32:54,241 --> 00:32:55,241
Is that so?

282
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,241
Could they be the ones
who killed His Majesty?

283
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,120
Faster!

284
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,880
Darn it. Will we just keep running away?

285
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:46,417
Even if we lose them here,
they will continue to chase us.

286
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,441
It may sound crazy, but it is not wrong.

287
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,680
Even if he is chosen, the
Crown Prince will not sit still.

288
00:33:52,681 --> 00:33:55,879
Bal Gi is the only prince who
can stop him. Am I not right?

289
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,359
Anyone would disagree about...

290
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,560
making the Youngest the
King, skipping the Fourth.

291
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,280
To spare anyone's life,

292
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:04,520
I think it is only right
to return to Bal Gi.

293
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,160
Darn it. Faster.

294
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,001
Your Majesty. Are you hurt?

295
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,001
Do not let them get away!

296
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,330
- Go!
- Get them!

297
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:45,481
- Let us go!
- Hurry!

298
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,921
Protect Her Majesty!

299
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,370
Darn those scumbags.
If only we had archers...

300
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,200
Mo Chi. When I give you
a signal, turn the carriage.

301
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
Yu Ha. Go to the front of the carriage.

302
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Now!

303
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,001
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

304
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,361
Your Majesty, it is dangerous
out here. Please go inside.

305
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,160
Grab the weapons. Now!

306
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

307
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,720
This is our chance. Close in on them!

308
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,001
Darn it. Come on!

309
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,330
Surround the carriage.

310
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,600
Hook the carriage!

311
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,850
Let us keep going!

312
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,600
Pull it harder!

313
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,600
Go!

314
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,481
Hurry!

315
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,881
Good grief!

316
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,370
Watch our rear.

317
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:11,280
Did you say the Head Secretary,
Song Woo, told you that...

318
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:13,481
the lily of the valley was
in the Head Maid's room?

319
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,881
Yes, my lord.

320
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,240
You can leave now.

321
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,720
Do you think Song Woo poisoned His Majesty?

322
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,080
That does not make sense.

323
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,369
He knew he would be the
first one to be suspected.

324
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,610
"Kill by the hands of another."

325
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,119
It would not be entirely
out of the question...

326
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,960
if he were to achieve it
through someone else.

327
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,961
Let me take care of it.

328
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,199
What could make...

329
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,639
the heart's blood coagulate
and lead to death...

330
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,849
without burning the oesophagus
was only the lily of the valley.

331
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,850
However,

332
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:35,720
the country manages the flowers.

333
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,001
Do you remember how the
Great Shaman was killed?

334
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,810
The eunuchs were after
the Great Shaman, not me...

335
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,441
as if they were trying to silence her.

336
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,521
The one in charge of
eunuchs in the palace is...

337
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,961
He is distorting the truth of the evidence.

338
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,760
I am certain he will deny it.

339
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,560
It does not matter.

340
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
He will have no choice
but to tell the truth.

341
00:43:05,441 --> 00:43:06,760
"Baeuitu."

342
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,280
What is it like there?

343
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,240
Baeuitu is...

344
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:23,160
named after an old term from Goguryeo.

345
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,279
All right. "Baeui" means rocks.

346
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,961
"Tu" means banks.

347
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,441
Rocky banks.

348
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,041
This region does not have a river.

349
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,801
Are you telling me there
is a bank made of rocks?

350
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:42,361
This happened a very long time ago.

351
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:43,961
During King Daemusin's reign,

352
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,240
our enemies from Liaodong
once attacked Guknaeseong.

353
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,160
I remember reading about it in the book.

354
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:51,759
I heard the name of a
man who helped the king...

355
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,000
and brought down the
commander of Liaodong's military...

356
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:56,759
was Eul Du Ji.

357
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,560
Yes, that is correct.
Eul Du Ji was his name.

358
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:03,360
So luckily, he was able
to drive out our enemies,

359
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:05,361
but the king was concerned.

360
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:07,801
What do you think was
the cause of his concern?

361
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:14,560
The king could not live forever.

362
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:18,040
He must have thought that
the enemies were bound...

363
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,640
to come back at one point.

364
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:21,120
That is correct.

365
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,120
That is why Eul Du Ji, the general,

366
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,199
devised a plan.

367
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,640
All right. It was...

368
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,000
to make a wide path
to lure in the enemies...

369
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:38,200
and to build a bank with rocks on the path.

370
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,760
(Baeuitu)

371
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,080
Go!

372
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:15,640
But I do not understand.

373
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,240
How could we use the rocks...

374
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:20,801
to stop our enemies?

375
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:26,680
Spur the horses.

376
00:45:32,921 --> 00:45:34,001
Let us go!

377
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,080
Father, here I will show
you what I am capable of.

378
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,199
They have entered Baeuitu now.

379
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,321
Cut the rope.

380
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:51,841
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,001
Mo Chi. Get the carriage
as close as possible.

382
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,119
I will give it a try,

383
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,320
but all of us will be dead
if it hits us in any way.

384
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:05,640
Come on.

385
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:15,881
Your Majesty!

386
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:27,120
How is this working?

387
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,041
Go!

388
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,041
Now!

389
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,401
Are you all right?

390
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,921
Yes.

391
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,640
- We must go faster!
- Yes.

392
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,001
- Mo Chi!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

393
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,040
Should we inform our kingdom of this?

394
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:23,600
Go!

395
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:25,521
Do not stop!

396
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,401
Gal Ro!

397
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:20,001
Hold!

398
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:34,760
Enough with playing games.

399
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,280
The true hunt begins now.

400
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:54,001

401
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,119
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

402
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,520

403

reality, it is by coincidence.)
