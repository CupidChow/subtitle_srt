1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:04,431
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:06,854
(Also, animals were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:08,564
(28 years ago)

5
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,606
This is His Majesty's order.

6
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:12,245
Today's winner,

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,366
regardless of his background,
age, or social status,

8
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,006
will obtain important
positions in the country.

9
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:20,925
General.

10
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,085
General.

11
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:34,565
General.

12
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,126
General.

13
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:44,925
My gosh.

14
00:00:47,526 --> 00:00:49,245
It is the final.

15
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:53,846
You go first. I will make the rules.

16
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,726
What rules do you want to make?

17
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,806
It is not fun if the king always
stays in the palace, is it?

18
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:02,365
You want to allow the king
to go outside the palace?

19
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:04,806
Let us do that.

20
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,685
Why did you not sacrifice the soldier?

21
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:33,484
If I hide the king...

22
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:36,845
and sacrifice the people only,
you cannot say I have truly won.

23
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,205
General.

24
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:51,485
Checkmate.

25
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:05,256
Your Highness.

26
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:10,976
I withdraw.

27
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,365
Where are you going?

28
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:36,605
(6 years ago in Jwamulchon,
Amnokgok, West Goguryeo)

29
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:00,765
It is impossible.

30
00:03:00,886 --> 00:03:03,044
The five tribes appoint
the prime minister...

31
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,566
through a Jega Conference
according to the law of Goguryeo.

32
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,246
How can you give that position...

33
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,644
to a man who used to farm
in a place like Jwamulchon?

34
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,805
Moreover, is he not the descendent...

35
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:14,726
of the royal family of Juna...

36
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,045
that perished by your grandfather?

37
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:21,166
He might be holding grudges against you.

38
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,621
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!

39
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:35,965
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!

40
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:41,965
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!
- We cannot accept it, Your Majesty!

41
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:42,966
We cannot...

42
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,605
From now on, Eul Pa So's will is my will.

43
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,126
Those who do not obey...

44
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,566
shall have their clans killed.

45
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:45,446
My job is to protect
the people with a sword.

46
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,006
And your job is to enrich
people with a writing brush.

47
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,365
If the day comes when a sword, not a brush,

48
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,806
is in your hand,

49
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:01,285
I will tear you into pieces and kill you.

50
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,324
(Queen Woo)

51
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:37,126
(Episode 3)

52
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,685
We have captured everyone...

53
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:45,046
who entered the King's
bedroom, just as you commanded.

54
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,165
What have you done?

55
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,805
Secrets are kept...

56
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,486
when there are only a few mouths to speak.

57
00:06:25,006 --> 00:06:26,806
All I did was leave only a few mouths.

58
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:46,686
Now,

59
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:49,046
there are only five people...

60
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:52,765
who know about this in the palace.

61
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,525
Let me take care of it.

62
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:44,765
Did you feel it?

63
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:50,725
I would bet my wrist that
those scumbags are not farmers.

64
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,125
Let us just kill them all.

65
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:55,686
No. It might shock Her Highness.

66
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,565
Let us take care of it quietly.

67
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,606
Hey.

68
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:04,725
I am Mo Chi.

69
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,046
Yu Ha, hurry up.

70
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,085
"Yu Ha."

71
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:13,126
"Yu Ha" is a nice name.

72
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,446
Are you Yu Ha?

73
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,126
"Yu Ha."

74
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,366
Let us take a look around.

75
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:33,765
I want to hear about my destiny.

76
00:08:35,336 --> 00:08:36,445
Even with the sun,

77
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:39,805
your star is shining brightly.

78
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,006
No. There is no way.

79
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,126
No.

80
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,285
What is the matter?

81
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:57,216
It is nothing. I thought
someone was coming.

82
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,165
Hurry up. Her Highness is in danger.

83
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:11,846
Just one drop...

84
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,565
Just one drop...

85
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:22,965
His Majesty died because of you.

86
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:26,726
I said only one drop was enough.

87
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:34,405
Your Highness.

88
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,366
They are assassins! Protect Her Highness!

89
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:58,125
They are the farmers from earlier.

90
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,326
Do you know who sent the assassins?

91
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,165
I do not know who it is,

92
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,405
but it seems they know the King has died,

93
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,446
considering that they tried to kill you.

94
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,045
What would you like to do?

95
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,886
Get ready to leave.

96
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,685
What is it?

97
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,606
There are no traces of a poison needle...

98
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:33,924
or any signs of corrosive
poison affecting his throat.

99
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:37,725
However, even though it has been
only an hour since he passed away,

100
00:13:37,726 --> 00:13:40,046
the blood in his heart seems
to have completely clotted...

101
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:42,645
as nothing came out on the cloth.

102
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,404
It appears that he ingested
a fast-acting poison...

103
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,645
that caused his heart to stop.

104
00:13:51,805 --> 00:13:52,805
My lord.

105
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:54,726
It is not me.

106
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:57,806
There are people in the palace
who handle medicine other than me,

107
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,525
such as shamans.

108
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:02,726
Shamans?

109
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:08,086
Find out what kind of poison was used.

110
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,126
Yes, my lord.

111
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:23,645
(Third Prince Bal Gi's fief)

112
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:25,925
- Let us go!
- Go!

113
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,606
Yu Ha.

114
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:35,285
Yu Ha.

115
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:40,045
It must have been your
first time to kill a person.

116
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:42,966
Some people say this.

117
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:44,804
Do you remember the
person you killed earlier?

118
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,326
When you think about his face,

119
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:50,045
his spirit will keep following you.

120
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,285
Keep going if you want to die.

121
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:54,846
I am serious.

122
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,285
We have just entered his land.

123
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,486
Slow down.

124
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,606
They are the White Tigers.

125
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:59,445
Nothing will happen as long
as we do not make eye contact.

126
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,805
What is going on?

127
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,645
Well, the thing is...

128
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,405
Did they do this?

129
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,686
They are wearing the garments
people around this area wear.

130
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,646
I think it was the Third
Prince who did this.

131
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,296
There was a child.

132
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,685
Six years old, probably.

133
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,125
The child killed his nanny's child.

134
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,645
Because he wanted to become the only one...

135
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:03,165
who could be fed by her.

136
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:05,685
But the child...

137
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,005
was not punished.

138
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,536
Because he was born as a prince.

139
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:19,086
They were burned to death
and their necks were severed.

140
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,404
He must have accused them
of being traitors to kill them.

141
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:22,405
No way.

142
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:25,136
How could ordinary people like
them have attempted treason?

143
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,645
The truth was not important.

144
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,965
What mattered to him was
to make people fear him.

145
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,685
When the child turned 15,

146
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:39,165
he coveted his subject's woman
and massacred his entire family.

147
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,245
He did not exactly want her.

148
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:44,806
He just wanted to let them know.

149
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:47,086
That he...

150
00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:48,886
was a prince.

151
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:55,296
(Hwaninsoo, Third Prince Bal Gi's palace)

152
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:14,685
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

153
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:20,485
- You.
- Yes?

154
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,887
Who do you think will become the
next king when the King passes away?

155
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:27,445
It is you, Your Highness.

156
00:19:37,965 --> 00:19:39,846
You must want me to become a traitor.

157
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,365
No, that is not true. Please spare my life.

158
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,606
That was not my intention.
Please do not kill me.

159
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:47,846
Get up.

160
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:49,326
Pardon?

161
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:55,925
Do not worry.

162
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,566
Good grief! Dear!

163
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,606
The rope must be in your
father's way! Do something!

164
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,326
Cut it!

165
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,725
Do not cut it! No!

166
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:21,405
Stop!

167
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,056
Father...

168
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:29,245
If that was how he drowns,

169
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,485
you should have stabbed me instead!

170
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:36,205
Had one of you killed me,
everyone would have lived.

171
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,005
How boring.

172
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:45,086
- Please spare his life!
- No, do not kill me!

173
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:46,965
- Please have mercy on him!
- Do not...

174
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,925
Do not help him out!

175
00:20:52,405 --> 00:20:53,806
Are you simply going to watch?

176
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,366
Stop him, will you?

177
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:56,605
No matter how bored he is,

178
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,606
- how can he go that far?
- Please do not kill me.

179
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:02,445
You are to answer me this time.

180
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,685
Who will take the throne next
when the King passes away?

181
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:11,606
I...

182
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:16,606
I do not know.

183
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:17,685
Please have mercy.

184
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:19,126
You do not know?

185
00:21:23,566 --> 00:21:24,566
Does that mean...

186
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,205
I cannot become the King?

187
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,126
No.

188
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,606
No.

189
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:37,005
Please do not kill me!

190
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,326
Please spare my life! I beg you!

191
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,685
No, please do not...

192
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:45,645
Father!

193
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,005
Father!

194
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,685
Father...

195
00:21:54,205 --> 00:21:55,885
- Please have mercy on us.
- Please do not kill us.

196
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:56,924
- Please have mercy.
- Please have mercy.

197
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,005
Father!

198
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,766
Your Highness!

199
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:16,046
If it is not of
importance, I will kill you.

200
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,725
The Queen is here.

201
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,485
The Queen came at this hour?

202
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,606
The glass was empty.

203
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,925
No poison was found in the food.

204
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:02,806
Are you certain?

205
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:07,165
If you are lying, all
your limbs will be cut off.

206
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,885
There were some toxic medicinal herbs.

207
00:23:15,886 --> 00:23:17,485
I fed it to a chicken.

208
00:23:18,205 --> 00:23:19,886
What could make...

209
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,365
the heart's blood coagulate
and lead to death...

210
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,525
without burning the esophagus...

211
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,526
(The lily of the valley
coagulates the heart and blood.)

212
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,526
was only the lily of the valley.

213
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,886
- However...
- What is it?

214
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:32,725
The country...

215
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:35,685
manages the flowers.

216
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,525
Are you implying someone
in the palace prepared it?

217
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:43,964
The culprit would have hidden...

218
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,165
the rest of the lily of the
valley in case they failed.

219
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:47,445
Mil Woo.

220
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,684
Search the rooms of those who visited...

221
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,366
His Majesty's chamber with the soldiers.

222
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:55,205
Follow me.

223
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,405
To use poison, they should
have been near His Majesty.

224
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:13,086
The culprit must be one
of His Majesty's servants.

225
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,606
Though it is only my assumption.

226
00:24:17,126 --> 00:24:19,685
After all, that man Woo
Do tried to kill everyone.

227
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:23,046
A mere royal maid would not
have dared to poison His Majesty.

228
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:25,606
Had she done it,

229
00:24:28,286 --> 00:24:30,245
she would not have known it was poison.

230
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,645
Let us find the one
who gave it to the maids.

231
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:50,046
Those who come to see
me want their fate to be read.

232
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,165
For what did you come here for?

233
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,366
Tell me about the medicines you use.

234
00:25:09,766 --> 00:25:12,245
I only have an elixir that
helps with rejuvenation...

235
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:14,685
and a potion that makes you feel love.

236
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:18,526
Do you have any medicine
that can kill a person?

237
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,086
No.

238
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:24,485
Both medicines can be taken
by my clients themselves.

239
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:27,046
They cannot kill a person.

240
00:25:36,846 --> 00:25:38,925
I thought you came because of His Majesty.

241
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:47,046
The light of Jamwiseong has disappeared.

242
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:52,925
Did...

243
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:57,165
something happen to His Majesty?

244
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,485
The night sky is cloudy.

245
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:07,766
Look for the Jamwiseong
light once it clears up.

246
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:12,485
Sungtaeseong protecting
Jamwiseong has also become faint.

247
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:15,846
One of the three stars
of Sungtaeseong is yours.

248
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,005
Please be careful.

249
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,526
The middle star of
Sungtaeseong is Her Majesty's.

250
00:26:30,126 --> 00:26:32,606
But I do not know who
the last one belongs to.

251
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:37,445
Have you called for me?

252
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:55,685
Find out what is happening in
the King's and Queen's Palaces.

253
00:26:57,286 --> 00:27:00,725
Do it discreetly. Make
sure no one finds out.

254
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:54,846
Even if the enemy takes you hostage...

255
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,405
and tries to take Goguryeo from me,

256
00:27:58,485 --> 00:27:59,846
I will not waver.

257
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:04,245
So if you get captured by an enemy,

258
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:09,606
use that to take your life...

259
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,685
or kill the enemy.

260
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:42,886
Everything is ready.

261
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,925
The Third Prince is here.

262
00:29:32,086 --> 00:29:34,485
Welcome, Sister-in-law.
It has been a while.

263
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:38,005
I heard my brother returned.

264
00:29:39,165 --> 00:29:40,846
But due to the order to guard this place,

265
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:42,806
I could not visit him.

266
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:47,445
Take a seat.

267
00:30:16,005 --> 00:30:17,086
How impressive...

268
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:21,766
for the Queen of this country
to leave the palace at night.

269
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:23,326
Oh, right.

270
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:27,245
Is it because you are
from the northern region?

271
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:52,444
You would not have come alone at this hour.

272
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:53,485
By any chance,

273
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:55,485
is His Majesty...

274
00:30:58,925 --> 00:30:59,965
His Majesty...

275
00:31:01,286 --> 00:31:02,366
is at the palace.

276
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:05,085
I stopped by to rest...

277
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:08,005
on my way to the north
under His Majesty's order.

278
00:31:08,886 --> 00:31:10,685
Am I causing an inconvenience?

279
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,086
Inconvenience? No. You are welcome here.

280
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:17,965
Why are you heading to the north?

281
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,165
Myeong Rim Eo Ru said something rude to me.

282
00:31:23,566 --> 00:31:25,566
Unable to overlook it,

283
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,405
His Majesty wants to take his army.

284
00:31:31,205 --> 00:31:32,205
Is that so?

285
00:31:33,005 --> 00:31:36,005
However, His Majesty is slightly
indisposed due to an injury.

286
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,405
I came in his stead.

287
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,806
So you came alone, yes?

288
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,685
I have something to ask you, Third Prince.

289
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:50,846
His Majesty wants me to do as he did...

290
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:54,006
to the Crown Prince to Myeong
Rim Eo Ru if he disobeys.

291
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,725
But I have not witnessed it.

292
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,566
Can you tell me...

293
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,005
what His Majesty did to the Crown Prince?

294
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,046
A traitor...

295
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:18,925
gets punished by ripping their limbs off.

296
00:32:19,485 --> 00:32:21,445
Unable to kill his brother, His Majesty...

297
00:32:22,405 --> 00:32:25,046
settled the matter by cutting off his nose.

298
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,086
What did Myeong Rim Eo Ru say...

299
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:51,846
to make my brother furious?

300
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:54,766
I was to be dethroned...

301
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:57,046
for not giving birth.

302
00:32:58,046 --> 00:32:59,526
I was simply disgusted at first.

303
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:01,685
But it got me curious.

304
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,965
If His Majesty passes away,

305
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,526
who will become the next king?

306
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:11,405
- It would be the Third...
- Chang Heon!

307
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,846
How dare you run your mouth before her?

308
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:25,806
That is...

309
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,366
for His Majesty...

310
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:30,526
to decide.

311
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:32,685
You are right.

312
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:37,566
Make yourself at home. I shall leave now.

313
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,245
Her Highness wants to see you.

314
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:06,005
Why did you lie?

315
00:34:07,485 --> 00:34:08,605
Head Maid, are you there?

316
00:34:09,726 --> 00:34:11,965
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Prepare to leave.

317
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:15,726
I will marry...

318
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:18,965
a different prince.

319
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,045
What do you mean? Father said...

320
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:35,766
Your Highness,

321
00:34:35,965 --> 00:34:38,005
are you sure about going
to a different prince now?

322
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:39,805
Then you might not make it to the palace...

323
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,405
before the Jega Conference.

324
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,044
Why do you not return to the
palace with the third prince...

325
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,085
as Prime Minister Eul said?

326
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:11,695
Did you see...

327
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,525
what happens when a man
like him is given the power?

328
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:20,015
I cannot let the man
like him take the throne.

329
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,286
Will you help me?

330
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:29,215
However,

331
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,084
if you do not return on time,

332
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,005
- your safety...
- I asked if you would help me.

333
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:50,125
(The Hours of the Dog, 19 to 21pm)

334
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,806
Do you think it is the same as
those who poisoned His Majesty?

335
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,604
What happens if anything
happens to Her Highness...

336
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,485
and the levirate marriage
cannot be achieved?

337
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:19,366
The Crown Prince can
claim his right to the throne...

338
00:36:19,965 --> 00:36:22,605
The family that is connected to
the Crown Prince by marriage...

339
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,085
is the one that received this letter.

340
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,445
(Gumnal Cave, Crown Prince Pae Eui's fief)

341
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:48,565
(Mt. Gumryeong, the Northern
Queen Family's palace)

342
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,366
They missed the Queen.

343
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,445
Please. Please stop.

344
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:26,125
That is not true.

345
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,175
That cannot be true.

346
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,575
Are you going to let
your sister have it again?

347
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,765
You were supposed to be the Queen.

348
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,766
Please.

349
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:58,925
Are you just going to watch your sister...

350
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:00,525
become the Queen again?

351
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:05,925
It is your fault.

352
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,445
It is all because of the
potion you gave me.

353
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,525
I said one drop was enough.

354
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:13,485
Right.

355
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,245
You are right.

356
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:16,445
It is my fault.

357
00:38:16,605 --> 00:38:18,484
So I must help Woo Hui
become the Queen again.

358
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:19,725
Then I will...

359
00:38:19,726 --> 00:38:22,846
I have seen it. You becoming the Queen.

360
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:28,366
There is another way.

361
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:35,766
Hae Dae Bu who was
originally a royal family...

362
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:38,445
has a prince who is not married yet.

363
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:39,766
If...

364
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:42,886
she marries him...

365
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,405
Oh, be quiet.

366
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:51,326
Oh, do you...

367
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,806
really think that way?

368
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,246
What the? Has she lost it?

369
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:30,925
What is the matter?

370
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:32,726
Did you not hear what that wench said?

371
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:35,485
That is what I said to the people!

372
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:38,215
Are you saying the Queen...

373
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:43,085
is trying to frame you as a traitor?

374
00:39:43,695 --> 00:39:45,655
She was lying about going
after Myeong Rim Eo Ru.

375
00:39:46,366 --> 00:39:48,366
It is me my brother is trying to kill.

376
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:50,565
Yes.

377
00:39:52,366 --> 00:39:53,886
The Daemodal of Wangdang is here too.

378
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,045
That wench is only here to test me.

379
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:57,886
I am sure my brother is here in person.

380
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,085
Find out where the
soldiers and Wangdang are.

381
00:40:00,846 --> 00:40:02,965
If I kneel before him
first, he will forgive me.

382
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:05,695
Now!

383
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:14,045
(Biryusoo, Western Hae Family's fief)

384
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:22,445
- Yes.
- Go.

385
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:25,085
Have you heard from the hidden one yet?

386
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:27,175
Should I gather the soldiers first?

387
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:44,215
Do you know a woman named Woo Soon?

388
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:47,405
She is the Queen's sister
who works as the Head Maid.

389
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,485
That woman said...

390
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:51,655
the King is dead.

391
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,846
Was that done by the man...

392
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:58,005
we hid?

393
00:40:58,886 --> 00:40:59,965
I am not sure.

394
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:02,215
However, Woo Soon said...

395
00:41:02,366 --> 00:41:04,174
the Queen went to Hwaninsoo...

396
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,286
to marry Bal Gi,

397
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:07,604
However, she changed her mind...

398
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,245
and decided to marry a different brother.

399
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:12,726
If we let her marry the Hae Family,

400
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,695
she promised to hand the Queen over.

401
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:16,726
I think the Woo Family is...

402
00:41:16,846 --> 00:41:19,326
trying to be the Queen Family again.

403
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,045
Or it may be a trap.

404
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,125
However, if it is true,

405
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:34,846
it will be a chance to retrieve
the throne from the Go Family.

406
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:37,085
Because you have always been a coward,

407
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:40,695
we lost the throne to the Go Family...

408
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,605
and had to stay low.

409
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:44,366
When the King's death spreads,

410
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:47,806
Myeong Rim Eo Ru will summon
the Crown Prince who was expelled...

411
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,806
and try to become the Queen Family.

412
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:54,886
Then it will only be harder
for us to retrieve the throne.

413
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:58,695
Dae Bu, what will you do?

414
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:17,125
I shall seize the Queen.

415
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,565
Yeo Mul, tell Bal Gi what happened.

416
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,445
Let him go after the Queen.

417
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:25,445
When this is over, we
will frame him a traitor...

418
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,846
and retrieve the throne.

419
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:33,806
What should I tell Woo Soon?

420
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:04,445
If we leave now, the third
prince will find it suspicious.

421
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:07,964
If he finds out His
Majesty has passed away...

422
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:10,366
He will not dare come in
here until the morning comes.

423
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:13,605
Go open the gates first.

424
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:58,524
What is the matter?

425
00:43:58,525 --> 00:44:00,125
Where is the Head Maid?

426
00:44:00,565 --> 00:44:01,726
The Head Maid...

427
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:03,445
Here she is.

428
00:44:04,686 --> 00:44:07,005
I am sorry. I had to
avoid drawing attention.

429
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,965
There is no time. Prepare to leave now.

430
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:27,286
Have you found the Wangdang yet?

431
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:36,085
The western region sent their secretary.

432
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:46,045
Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Wi Yeo Mul.

433
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:43,246
Search thoroughly.

434
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,246
- Yes.
- Yes.

435
00:45:53,886 --> 00:45:55,846
Your Highness, I think
we managed to fool them.

436
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,925
However, when the sun rises,
the third prince will find out.

437
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:01,686
We must rush.

438
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:20,564
We have checked thoroughly,

439
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:22,246
but no Wangdang soldiers were found.

440
00:46:23,045 --> 00:46:25,925
It seems the Queen has
chosen a different prince.

441
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:37,806
And why are you telling me this?

442
00:46:37,886 --> 00:46:40,085
There is only one thing my authority wants.

443
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:42,886
For the Go Family and the Hae Family...

444
00:46:43,085 --> 00:46:44,925
to share Goguryeo's
throne like the old days.

445
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:47,605
If you promise him that,

446
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,485
he will help you sit
on the throne willingly.

447
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:07,925
Do you believe that my
brother has passed away?

448
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:09,646
What if it is not true?

449
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,886
Then the Queen would
not have left like that.

450
00:47:14,686 --> 00:47:17,366
If those with troops consisting of
northern region slaves help you,

451
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:20,125
the throne will be yours.

452
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:21,686
However,

453
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:25,166
if the Queen chooses
one of my younger brothers,

454
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:27,806
it will be complex.

455
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:40,726
Chang Heon.

456
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,525
Summon the White Tigers.

457
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,005
I heard there was something to catch.

458
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:19,766
What kind of animal is it?

459
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:24,646
Noe Eum.

460
00:49:25,605 --> 00:49:27,846
When was the last time you hunted humans?

461
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:49,206
(Work by Director Jeong Se Gyo)

462
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,564
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

463
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:36,885
(and episodes are partially fictional.)

464
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:39,246
(Even if any are related to
reality, it is by coincidence.)
