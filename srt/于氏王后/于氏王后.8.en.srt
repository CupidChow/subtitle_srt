00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:01,640
(All figures, locations, groups,
incidents, medical terms, )

2
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:02,961
(and others in this drama
are entirely fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:04,441
(Animal scenes were directed and filmed...)

4
00:00:04,442 --> 00:00:06,682
(under production guidelines
along with animal experts.)

5
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,921
(18 years ago)

6
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:38,655
Even if you were the Crown Prince,

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,177
Father abdicated the throne to me.

8
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,935
Desiring it is an act of
treason. It is unforgivable.

9
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,176
Spare my life.

10
00:00:46,177 --> 00:00:47,296
If you do,

11
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:50,137
I will return to Liaodong and never return.

12
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:54,537
Nam Mu. Are we not brothers?

13
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:56,256
The Royal Family member
should be ripped apart to death...

14
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,056
for committing treason.

15
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:00,257
But as you are my
brother, I will not kill you.

16
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,177
Nam Mu?

17
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:09,856
Nam Mu!

18
00:02:55,856 --> 00:03:01,056
(Queen Woo)

19
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:05,856
(Episode 8)

20
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,337
Your Majesty. As ordered,

21
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:10,377
I have issued a draft to the Wangdang.

22
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,976
I wish to fight for Your Majesty.

23
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,817
You are no longer Wangdang.
There is no need to risk your life.

24
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,696
- Leave.
- I will not leave.

25
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:44,217
Allow me to fight for Her Majesty.

26
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:45,817
Drag him out.

27
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,057
Mu Gol.

28
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,895
My apologies.

29
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,415
Once kicked out of Wangdang,

30
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,616
one cannot return. That is the rule.

31
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,416
Even with my command?

32
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,416
Your Majesty. To me, Wangdang is...

33
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:04,895
my family and everything.

34
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:08,097
Grant me permission, and I, Mo Chi, will...

35
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,937
dedicate my life to Your Majesty.

36
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,737
Give him an armour.

37
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,536
The Third Prince will make the first move.

38
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,135
However, he cannot
fight against Wangdang...

39
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:33,616
with his military.

40
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:35,776
He will secure forces to join him first.

41
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:39,535
Before that, we must get...

42
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,536
the pledge of alliance
from all five tribes.

43
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:44,536
However, with what the
Third Prince has done,

44
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,536
it is uncertain how many
will support Your Majesty.

45
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:08,257
The five tribes' forefathers...

46
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,456
offered these swords and
pledged loyalty to King Chu Mo.

47
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:29,257
It is now time to keep their oath.

48
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,776
No, Your Highness.

49
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:35,817
We still need their help.

50
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:39,857
Also, they did not come empty-handed.

51
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:43,016
They brought the Fourth
Prince's wife and children.

52
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,696
Do forgive them.

53
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:20,817
Prepare a map.

54
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:34,136
We must forge an alliance
with the mounted warriors first.

55
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:37,297
With them, the Third
Prince will not be able...

56
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:39,817
to start a war thoughtlessly.

57
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:42,817
Whether they will help
with this matter is uncertain.

58
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:57,857
Daemodal of the South will
dedicate my life to the Third Prince.

59
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:00,216
There are four tribes left.

60
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:02,696
Before the Queen and Eul Pa So take action,

61
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,297
an envoy must be sent to them.

62
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,336
The mounted warriors entered
the Third Prince's fortress.

63
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,776
Since the mounted warriors
joined the Third Prince,

64
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,737
war has become inevitable.

65
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,776
Hwa Do Ja would not have dared to do that.

66
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:32,417
Someone in the South must
have joined hands with Bal Gi.

67
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:35,857
He knew this would happen
and got them involved in advance.

68
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,656
The South violated its oath.

69
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,737
What about the Queen Family?

70
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:53,977
Everyone wants to become the Queen Family.

71
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,896
They will not take the Queen's side.

72
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:00,096
The problem lies with
the East Chief Priest.

73
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,297
It is him.

74
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:04,896
He does not have a proper military.

75
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:06,497
Do not let them bother you.

76
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:10,617
For disturbing the country,

77
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:14,696
the Chief Priest cannot step
foot inside the royal palace.

78
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:19,177
We must win the favour
of the remaining four tribes.

79
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:56,617
Inform the North Queen Family
of the Third Prince Bal Gi's doings.

80
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,936
Order the West Hae Family Tribe
to keep their oath to King Chu Mo.

81
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:05,016
(West, North)

82
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:16,737
Is it true?

83
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:20,217
Did Bal Gi that scum take my sister?

84
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:25,136
Then what about my sister?

85
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,497
What happened to her?

86
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,736
Answer me.

87
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,737
Answer me, please.

88
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,497
Darn it.

89
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,857
Her Majesty wants you to
keep your forefather's pledge...

90
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,217
to King Chu Mo to protect the throne.

91
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:00,377
Inform her we will.

92
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,977
- Lead them the way.
- Understood.

93
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,176
Why is it so simple?

94
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,656
Is it not strange?

95
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,217
Did you not see the one behind the curtain?

96
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:21,056
The oath has already been broken.

97
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:32,776
Can you truly break the
promise with King Chu Mo?

98
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:36,296
The Third Prince is of
King Chu Mo's bloodline.

99
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:42,097
If he keeps the promise that
both families will share the throne,

100
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,016
the oath will not be broken.

101
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:56,295
There is no excuse to
oppose the levirate marriage.

102
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,696
But that man Bal Gi
will take issue with it.

103
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,376
He may be a scoundrel,

104
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:04,497
but would he do that to us who
share the same Royal Family?

105
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,416
Prime Minister Eul has arrived.

106
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,497
The Third Prince has sent a letter.

107
00:11:52,497 --> 00:11:54,097
It is to you, my lord.

108
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,777
Like with the Crown Prince,

109
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,416
we will certainly get
our chance if we do not...

110
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,337
take any side.

111
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:35,497
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

112
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:39,497
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

113
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:42,337
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

114
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,457
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

115
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:49,337
- To the sky we pray.
- To the sky we pray.

116
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:53,136
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

117
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:02,617
When the day turns red,
glory will shine upon us.

118
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,415
To the sky we pray.

119
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,216
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

120
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,456
To the sky we pray.

121
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,616
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

122
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:12,216
To the sky we pray.

123
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,857
- Protect us.
- Protect us.

124
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,056
The Chief Priest and the Queen Family.

125
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,257
They have taken the other side, yes?

126
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,056
If they wish for war,

127
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,656
I will grant it.

128
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,217
Head to Guknaeseong.

129
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,416
We are going to war.

130
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,176
Our destination is Guknaeseong.

131
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:13,976
We are going to war.

132
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,657
- Our destination is Guknaeseong.
- Our destination is Guknaeseong.

133
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,976
Even if the Queen Family...

134
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,135
and the Eastern Authority
stop the Hae Family,

135
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:29,377
we cannot stop the mounted warriors.

136
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,656
How about getting the
Fifth Prince involved?

137
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,456
The Fifth Prince's armoured soldiers...

138
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,815
could stop the mounted warriors' attack.

139
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:38,896
However, he, too,

140
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,377
is one of His Majesty's younger brothers.

141
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:44,257
He could also be after the throne.

142
00:14:58,457 --> 00:14:59,656
Is it true?

143
00:15:00,257 --> 00:15:02,056
That Nam Mu has passed away.

144
00:15:11,816 --> 00:15:13,497
The Queen has Wangdang,

145
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:16,097
but the mounted warriors joined
hands with the Third Prince.

146
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,857
Winning will be a challenge.

147
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,617
What will Your Highness do?

148
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:30,337
Do Su Ryu. Get the armoured soldiers ready.

149
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:32,497
Understood, Your Highness.

150
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,415
(Guknaeseong)

151
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:53,337
Once war breaks, there
can be no turning back.

152
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:55,097
According to my source,

153
00:15:55,176 --> 00:15:57,536
the Third Prince left to
meet the Crown Prince.

154
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,296
If the Crown Prince comes,

155
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,896
we cannot win.

156
00:16:09,737 --> 00:16:12,056
We simply cannot help
but think we will lose.

157
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:15,457
However, there is no war we cannot win.

158
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:22,016
And I must win.

159
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,217
With the number of our soldiers,

160
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,337
defending this great
fortress is out of the question.

161
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,257
No.

162
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:42,737
There must be a way.

163
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,577
Secure 100 steps before the fortress.

164
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,617
Get the Wangdang ready.

165
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,175
Make all the preparations.
We are going to war.

166
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:02,256
- Understood.
- Understood.

167
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:11,016
- Come back alive!
- Distribute weapons...

168
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,587
so the people can defend themselves.

169
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:14,816
Gather supplies for any emergency.

170
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,535
- Prepare for war.
- Hurry.

171
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:23,257
To those who can shoot arrows,
have them protect the fortress.

172
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,096
Move quickly. Come on.

173
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:28,296
Do not lose your bow and arrow.

174
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:29,616
Hurry.

175
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,016
Keep moving. Hurry.

176
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,816
Prepare for war.

177
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:17,457
(Sashi: The Time of the Snake, 9am to 11am)

178
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,376
They are people who fled
before the Third Prince.

179
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,427
- Good grief.
- Come now.

180
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,616
Come inside.

181
00:18:35,016 --> 00:18:37,667
- Keep them moving.
- Goodness.

182
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:39,216
I am exhausted.

183
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,015
- Why are there so many?
- Move.

184
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,216
We could have arrived earlier.

185
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:43,576
The enemy is nearing!

186
00:18:44,177 --> 00:18:45,216
Get ready!

187
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:47,016
- Get ready!
- Get ready!

188
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,375
Get into the fortress!

189
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:53,095
- Hurry!
- Close the gates!

190
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,257
- Move it!
- Get into the fortress!

191
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:57,697
Come on.

192
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,015
- Let us go inside.
- Close the gates.

193
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,576
- Understood.
- Close it!

194
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,427
(Guknaeseong)

195
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,427
Do not shoot until they
are within 100 steps.

196
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:35,976
- Standby!
- Standby!

197
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:37,295
- Standby!
- Standby!

198
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,815
Be on alert!

199
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:40,666
Be on alert!

200
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,217
- Be on alert!
- Be on alert!

201
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,737
It is the Youngest Prince.

202
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:03,737
(Guknaeseong)

203
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:16,536
(Fifth Prince Go Gye Su)

204
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:34,015
(Secretary Do Su Ryu)

205
00:20:34,016 --> 00:20:35,856
Is that truly Your Highness's wish?

206
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,056
Raise it up.

207
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,056
They have no intention of fighting us.

208
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:16,457
With Wangdang and the Youngest
Prince's armoured soldiers,

209
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,667
the mounted warriors can be stopped.

210
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,576
It is the North Queen Family.

211
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,147
(From the North Family, Eo Ji
Ryu, Yeon Gae, Jwa Ja Mak)

212
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:34,427
The army from the East has also arrived.

213
00:21:38,536 --> 00:21:39,815
(Secretary Ma Ro, Chief Priest Seol Joo)

214
00:21:39,816 --> 00:21:41,656
(Sa Gu, Sa Bi's father,
the Eastern Authority)

215
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:50,736
- Yes!
- Look!

216
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,217
- The reinforcements have come!
- We will live!

217
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:58,976
- We are safe!
- We are safe!

218
00:21:58,977 --> 00:22:02,095
- We are safe!
- We are safe!

219
00:22:02,096 --> 00:22:03,816
- We are safe!
- We are safe!

220
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:06,616
- Hooray!
- We are safe!

221
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:09,296
- We are safe!
- We are safe!

222
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,217
You ought to have
avoided the war at all costs.

223
00:23:00,497 --> 00:23:02,657
Why do you seek to wage this war?

224
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,456
Blinded by their greed for the throne,

225
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:07,032
the Third Prince and the Crown Prince...

226
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:09,056
have allied with our enemy, Liaodong.

227
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,575
Should they triumph in this war,

228
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:13,696
the country His Majesty
gave everything to protect...

229
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,776
will fall into the hands of Liaodong.

230
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:29,096
The king entrusted me with a single task.

231
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,457
It was to protect the royal palace...

232
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,417
if the mounted warriors
were to plot treason.

233
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:37,056
With the strategy he taught me,

234
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,497
I am certain we can stop them.

235
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:41,376
I am certain of it.

236
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:17,056
I took care of the body quietly.

237
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:31,056
Fortunately, Eul Pa So
has not caught wind of it.

238
00:24:33,497 --> 00:24:36,336
Are you certain you will not need Sa Bi?

239
00:24:36,937 --> 00:24:39,056
She has fulfilled her role.

240
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:41,856
She was after my position anyway.

241
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,657
Now that the Fourth
Prince is in the palace,

242
00:24:46,616 --> 00:24:48,296
she is no longer of use to me.

243
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:51,497
Once the war ends,

244
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,616
take care of her father as well.

245
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:54,776
Understood.

246
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,336
The sky deity is on our side.

247
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:02,417
Once this storm passes,

248
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:07,536
Eul Pa So will be
leaving the palace as well.

249
00:25:08,737 --> 00:25:10,536
I do not see the Fourth Prince.

250
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:13,816
The throne needs its rightful
owner. So make haste and find him

251
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,096
I am on it.

252
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,416
Should we not soon settle on the family...

253
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,937
from which the Queen will be selected?

254
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:29,776
It is time for the Myeong Rim
Family to withdraw from this matter.

255
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:32,096
The same goes for the Woo Family.

256
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:41,017
It will not matter who
ascends to the throne.

257
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,616
You will no longer be the Head Secretary.

258
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,816
You will be forced to make a choice too...

259
00:25:47,096 --> 00:25:50,016
just as a dog seeks a new master
when its former one passes away.

260
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,257
Which side will you join?

261
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:21,457
My brother no longer
walks among the living.

262
00:26:22,816 --> 00:26:24,376
I do not see the need to pick a side.

263
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,296
You cannot leave like this.

264
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:41,375
There seems to be a spy who is in touch...

265
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:42,737
with people outside the palace.

266
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:02,096
I shall continue to observe
the situation and then decide...

267
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:05,376
whom I will serve.

268
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,016
(The fief of the Third Prince, Bal Gi)

269
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,336
How did he pass?

270
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:38,737
He was poisoned.

271
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,376
Did you find out who poisoned him?

272
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,336
We are still investigating.

273
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:02,016
I would like to ask you a question.

274
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:05,457
Why are you violating your vows to him?

275
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:13,056
Was the levirate marriage...

276
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:16,657
Brother Nam Mu's wish?

277
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:35,816
Yes, it was.

278
00:30:05,257 --> 00:30:07,977
(Guknaeseong)

279
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,697
If you show this to him,

280
00:30:26,856 --> 00:30:29,177
Song Woo will think
you are on the same side.

281
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:36,977
Moreover, make sure
to observe every move...

282
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:39,376
Eul Pa So makes.

283
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:51,697
Are you there?

284
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:59,136
I need you to do something discreetly.

285
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:03,097
I heard Eul Pa So was the first one
to suspect His Majesty was poisoned.

286
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,296
Find out why he suspected poisoning.

287
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,697
What have you found out?

288
00:31:15,056 --> 00:31:17,497
Prime Minister Eul did
not seem to be the culprit.

289
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:19,937
However...

290
00:31:25,616 --> 00:31:27,376
Inform Eul Pa So.

291
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,937
Song Woo joined Bal Gi's side.

292
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:28,497
Prime Minister Eul.

293
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:31,897
Why are you doing this to me?

294
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:35,897
Do you suspect me of
having murdered the late King?

295
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:38,177
Is this why you are doing this to me?

296
00:32:39,576 --> 00:32:41,176
Do you have evidence for your suspicion?

297
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,177
I have everything I need.

298
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:53,177
"The King is dead."

299
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,775
"The Queen wants to
marry the Third Prince."

300
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:56,977
"An assassin is needed."

301
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:02,697
"The Queen is on her
way to the Fourth Prince."

302
00:33:12,497 --> 00:33:13,536
Prime Minister Eul!

303
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:18,657
That had nothing to do with His Majesty.

304
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:25,456
I was informed you were the
one who told the Head Maid...

305
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:26,657
about the lily of the valley.

306
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:31,096
Were you also behind murdering...

307
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,177
His Majesty?

308
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:35,856
No.

309
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:38,336
I am blameless in the
matter of His Majesty's death.

310
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,376
You could not have
contrived this plot on your own.

311
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,217
I will uncover whether you
are in league with another...

312
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:52,137
and figure out the
mastermind, controlling you.

313
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:57,137
I shall question you relentlessly
until you reveal the truth to me.

314
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:02,096
Prime Minister Eul!

315
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:05,617
Prime Minister Eul! Allow
me to explain everything.

316
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,657
I am...

317
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,496
a lowly messenger...

318
00:34:09,976 --> 00:34:13,617
bearing only the words of others!

319
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:20,296
I had intended...

320
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,026
to observe the situation a while longer.

321
00:34:27,737 --> 00:34:30,546
But now it is time to choose my ally.

322
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:58,336
So all four princes have arrived?

323
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,856
We now face more foes
than we first anticipated.

324
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:04,065
I would advise waiting for another chance.

325
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:05,097
No.

326
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:07,786
We will proceed with our plan.

327
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,217
Actually, it has worked out for the better.

328
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:15,546
No matter who emerges
victorious, by the time the war is over,

329
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:18,737
they shall have already spilled much blood.

330
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:21,456
The war...

331
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:25,336
will center around the royal palace.

332
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,296
Until then,

333
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,736
we will bide our time...

334
00:35:29,737 --> 00:35:31,696
behind Mount Chilseong,
concealing our forces in secrecy.

335
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:32,697
Understood.

336
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,936
General, prepare to go into battle.

337
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:43,936
Hurry up!

338
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:46,657
- I told you to hurry! Move it!
- Be swift!

339
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:50,616
Why are you taking so long?
Could you get rid of them now?

340
00:35:50,697 --> 00:35:51,896
Move quickly.

341
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,026
How dare he?

342
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,935
The youngest had always been loyal...

343
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:00,546
to Nam Mu since he was a boy.

344
00:36:01,896 --> 00:36:04,737
He shall pay the price for
his loyalty once the war ends.

345
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,217
Where are our troops?

346
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:09,257
They are about an hour behind.

347
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:11,978
We must strike before they
are fully prepared for battle.

348
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:14,375
Then the Queen will
not be able to last a day...

349
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:15,697
before choosing to surrender.

350
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,376
Make haste!

351
00:36:21,776 --> 00:36:23,026
If not, I will...

352
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,936
To make them understand your needs,

353
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,257
actions speak louder than words.

354
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,296
Move it!

355
00:36:49,137 --> 00:36:50,936
When I went head-to-head with Nam Mu,

356
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,656
you saw how those scoundrels betrayed me.

357
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:55,177
Yet, you still joined hands with them?

358
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,065
This time, they will not
have the chance to betray us.

359
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:01,472
I made them an offer
they could not turn down.

360
00:37:01,496 --> 00:37:04,137
How naive you are to have believed them.

361
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:09,026
Do you think a mere bow
could claim Nam Mu's life?

362
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:13,066
Then did someone poison him?

363
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:17,217
Which tribe would benefit
the most from the King's death?

364
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:21,336
They might come after us next.

365
00:37:22,496 --> 00:37:24,496
I was not expecting the Crown Prince.

366
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,496
What are they planning?

367
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:31,776
They will want revenge for the betrayal.

368
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,936
We should keep our eyes on them.

369
00:37:42,066 --> 00:37:45,066
The enemy's main army was passing Baeuitu.

370
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:48,336
It will take them at least
half an hour to get here.

371
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,776
(Catapult)

372
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,456
The Crown Prince has...

373
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:11,025
catapults borrowed from
Liaodong's Gong Sun family...

374
00:38:11,026 --> 00:38:12,657
and a troop of elephants.

375
00:38:14,456 --> 00:38:16,065
Even if the Fifth Prince's armoured men...

376
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:17,976
fight off the mounted warriors,

377
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:22,456
if the Crown Prince's catapults
break the walls and they advance,

378
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:25,976
there is no way to stop them after that.

379
00:38:27,257 --> 00:38:30,856
Are you saying we must
hand over the throne?

380
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:33,376
I am saying we should find another way.

381
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,896
Many lives will be sacrificed.

382
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,736
Why do you wish to
start a war you will lose?

383
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:49,416
If they are to come to power,

384
00:38:50,257 --> 00:38:52,815
the people will suffer even more in life.

385
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:55,815
However, there is no
way to defend the palace.

386
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:58,295
If it cannot be defended,
it can be abandoned.

387
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,336
Your Majesty.

388
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:05,816
For what do you wish to fight?

389
00:39:12,657 --> 00:39:14,066
You know also.

390
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,257
This fight...

391
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:21,856
is not about who will take the throne.

392
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:26,976
You are not unlike me.

393
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:32,617
(Cart)

394
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:39,416
You keep doing what you did.

395
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:44,217
I will continue what I did.

396
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,586
Can we win?

397
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:07,856
It is a preposterous move.

398
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:13,496
Oh, yes.

399
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:17,936
Perhaps that might be how we win.

400
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,546
Is this what it was all for?

401
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:22,856
Did you choose the Fourth Prince...

402
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:25,066
for something like this?

403
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:29,936
This would not have happened
if you had done as I had said.

404
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:31,976
It is not too late...

405
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:34,776
to marry the Third Prince.

406
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:37,217
If you do that...

407
00:41:37,218 --> 00:41:39,375
He will never take the throne.

408
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,416
Your Majesty.

409
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:49,657
No longer...

410
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:53,416
will I live like a chess piece.

411
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:57,496
Anyone who gets in my way,

412
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:01,976
I will not forgive,
even if it is you, Father.

413
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:06,816
As a woman, there is nothing you can do.

414
00:42:06,936 --> 00:42:08,416
Do you not see that?

415
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:14,217
Do you truly believe so?

416
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,217
I did not do anything because I was told...

417
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:20,936
a woman could not and
should not do anything.

418
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:25,456
Now I will show you what I can do.

419
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,415
(Hwandoseong, Guknaeseong)

420
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:50,617
Do you have Hwandoseong in mind?

421
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:16,776
If you cannot defeat a
tiger in the mountains,

422
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:19,776
you must lure it into the open.

423
00:43:20,217 --> 00:43:24,936
(Hwandoseong)

424
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:30,376
(Guknaeseong)

425
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:38,375
Only you can take over from His Majesty.

426
00:43:38,376 --> 00:43:40,976
Why did you side with the Queen?

427
00:43:41,097 --> 00:43:44,376
Should I do wrong like
my brothers are about to?

428
00:43:44,697 --> 00:43:47,656
This is not unjust. You have a right.

429
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,057
I swore to my brother long ago.

430
00:43:52,177 --> 00:43:53,496
That I would fight...

431
00:43:54,776 --> 00:43:57,697
only for Goguyreo and her people.

432
00:43:58,657 --> 00:44:00,217
I will never commit wrong...

433
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:03,056
by borrowing the might of foreign forces...

434
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,456
and shedding the blood of our people.

435
00:44:13,657 --> 00:44:15,097
The enemy is coming.

436
00:44:16,856 --> 00:44:18,057
Be prepared.

437
00:44:21,657 --> 00:44:22,815
Be prepared!

438
00:44:22,816 --> 00:44:24,057
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:26,057
- Be prepared!
- Be prepared!

440
00:44:39,856 --> 00:44:41,976
I decided the day we got married...

441
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:43,577
that one day...

442
00:44:44,896 --> 00:44:46,776
I would make your dream come true.

443
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:04,177
Did you find a way to abandon the palace?

444
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:06,976
We need time.

445
00:45:11,577 --> 00:45:13,776
You did not answer my question.

446
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:22,976
I will ask you again.

447
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:26,936
Are you on my side?

448
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,097
Your dream.

449
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:53,296
I will help you realize it now.

450
00:45:56,896 --> 00:46:00,296
I will earn us the time. Find a way.

451
00:46:27,976 --> 00:46:29,697
I have not been here in a long time.

452
00:46:32,896 --> 00:46:34,697
I will take this palace.

453
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:37,177
You can take Jolbon Fortress.

454
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:45,416
The Queen seems to want to fight.

455
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:01,296
Listen, all of you!

456
00:47:03,296 --> 00:47:06,896
Under no circumstances are you...

457
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:12,376
to let the enemy into these walls!

458
00:47:14,776 --> 00:47:15,896
Do you understand?

459
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:17,577
- Yes!
- Yes!

460
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:24,376
Do not be intimidated.

461
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:27,217
Fight and die like a Wangdang.

462
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,137
It is a last-ditch effort.

463
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:42,416
They cannot do anything.

464
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,097
Before the day is over,

465
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,737
they will kneel before me.

466
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:54,375
The Gong Sun family army will arrive soon.

467
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:55,976
Shall I have them set up the catapults?

468
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,177
There is no rush.

469
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:03,776
For now, we shall watch
and see what they do.

470
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,137
This should be amusing.

471
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:05,657
Your Majesty. It is dangerous.

472
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:07,456
Return to the palace.

473
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:12,896
His Majesty never sent his
men to the battlefield alone.

474
00:49:33,416 --> 00:49:34,816
I will fight alongside them.

475
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:41,496
Her Majesty the Queen...

476
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:44,217
will fight alongside you!

477
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:45,816
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

478
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:35,936
You will fear the enemy's weapons.

479
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:44,137
But we have something they do not.

480
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:50,336
The reason to fight.

481
00:51:56,537 --> 00:51:59,336
I do not want you or your descendants...

482
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:04,137
to live like chess pieces
controlled by others.

483
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:09,496
I will defend the palace...

484
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,296
and build a new Goguryeo!

485
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:17,496
And then I will end this war.

486
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:20,776
Brothers!

487
00:52:22,577 --> 00:52:24,177
Will you fight with me?

488
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,855
Prepare to attack!

489
00:53:23,856 --> 00:53:25,776
- Prepare to attack!
- Prepare to attack!

490
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:41,697
Be ready!

491
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:16,617
(Cart)

492
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:23,057
Open the gates!

493
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:30,657
Fire!

494
00:54:45,137 --> 00:54:49,177
(Queen Woo)

495
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,577
(Work by Director Jeong Se Gyo)

496
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:40,136
(All people, names, titles, incidents, )

497
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:42,375
(and episodes are partially fictional.)

498
00:58:42,376 --> 00:58:44,936
(Even if any are related to
reality, it is by coincidence.)
