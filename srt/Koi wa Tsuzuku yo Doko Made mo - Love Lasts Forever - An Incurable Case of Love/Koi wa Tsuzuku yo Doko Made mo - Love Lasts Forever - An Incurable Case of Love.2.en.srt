1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,870
Just how long are you going to follow me?

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,920
Doctor, why did you come here?

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,110
- What? This is my place.
- What?!

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,440
This is my place.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,800
I did hear someone was moving into the next unit.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,480
Welcome home, Kairi! I thought you would never come home.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,940
Oh? Is this our neighbor? Do you know her?

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,820
Unfortunately...

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,760
Well... Good night!

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,900
Fortune Cat... Was this really a lost cause?

11
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,020
Here, take this!

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,550
It was kept in the management office, but I'm glad to be able to give it to you.

13
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,510
Oh, thank you!

14
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,390
It's from home! Kagoshima fried fishcakes!

15
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,960
Wait... the management office?

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,120
- Yeah. I'm the building manager.
- Really?

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,820
I'm sorry for not introducing myself earlier. I'm Nanase Sakura.

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,890
Do you want some? They're made with edamame, corn, burdock root...

19
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,300
Wow! Want to come over? Do you care for a drink?

20
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,300
To your place...?

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Yeah, come on!

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,680
Come on in!

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,300
A love nest...

24
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,800
- Take a seat.
- Okay!

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Kagoshima fishcakes go well with...

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,990
- Ta-da!
- "The Devil."
[Devil]

27
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,400
Let's get drunk tonight.

28
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
It looks like you had quite a head start.

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,600
- Don't be so uptight, Nanako.
- It's Nanase.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,060
Aren't you one of the newbies? Let's drink to your new job!

31
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,190
To be precise, I'm still in training.

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,850
We do three-day rotations at each ward,

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,000
but I want to join cardiology with Dr. Tendo.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,400
- Wait... so are you the hero, Nanako?
- What?

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,090
I heard there is a hero among the newbie nurses who spent five years on her crush Kairi, the Devil,

36
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,300
and confessed her love on her first day, and he totally shot her down!

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,500
- You know all too well.
- Many of the hospital employees live here.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm so sorry!

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,350
I had no idea about you! I promise I won't interfere anymore.

40
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,610
What are you doing here?

41
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,420
If you're done, go home.

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,260
- O-Okay! I'm sorry for intruding!
- Wait, Naoko. Don't go!

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,410
I invited her, you Devil!

44
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,200
- Wouldn't that make you a witch, Big Sis?
- Sister?

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:49,980
Just call me "Booze Fairy".

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,030
Did you just call her "Big Sis"?

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,700
- W-What?! Older sister?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,020
Ryuko Tendo. I'm his older sister.

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,470
I see... His older sister?

50
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,390
Our family has been doctors for generations. Our hometown is Kagoshima, though.

51
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,610
Our grandfather bought this building to rent condos to doctors and nurses, mostly.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,380
That explains why the rent was so cheap!

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:28,720
Believe it or not, I was aiming to be a doctor once.

54
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,070
But I can't drink when I have night shifts!

55
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:40,510
I hate to be restricted, either by work or men.

56
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,730
Alright, cheers!

57
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,190
Cheers!

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,050
Man, that's good.

59
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,400
Does this mean in the future I'll...?

60
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,870
I received more Kagoshima fishcakes.

61
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Well, let's eat them together.

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:10,020
Here. Returning the favor for last night.

63
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,820
Oh! It's delicious.

64
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,300
Your place is always next to me.

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,950
Yes!

66
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,400
Something like that might happen in the future.

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,490
Why are you looking around the room with a grin?

68
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,720
- O-Oh, it's nothing...
- Listen up.

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,800
If you really do plan on joining our department, I'm not going to go easy on you.

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,910
You're so proud for someone who can't hold their liquor.

71
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:49,100
If you get in the way like a rock blocking, I'll fire you in a heartbeat.

72
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:55,500
There's still time. If you don't want to get fired, go to another department.

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't!

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,600
I'll become a capable nurse!

75
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,020
I won.

76
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,010
I see. Starting today, you're officially assigned to the department.

77
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,940
Welcome to the Cardiology Department.

78
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,830
- We'll be in your care.
- We'll be in your care.

79
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,520
I had a feeling that Miss Hero would be joining us, following Dr. Tendo.

80
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
With everyone's help...

81
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,050
my goal as a woman and a nurse is...

82
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,600
defeat the Devil!

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,700
I like it. That's the spirit!

84
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,600
All gone. The cream pan.

85
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm sorry! I couldn't save any for you today.

86
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,680
But that's why I have the cream pan savings...

87
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,640
- She was here first. Here.
- Oh no!

88
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,030
Dr. Tendo, did you want one?

89
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,140
No.

90
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,970
Please enjoy it, Head Nurse.

91
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,920
And our first choice, Sakai! Welcome to the ward!

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,800
A very warm welcome!

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,490
So many other departments tried to scout you.

94
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,820
Why did you pick us?

95
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:29,860
Because cardiology deals with the heart, the most vital part of the body.

96
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,810
So I thought I could learn everything about nursing here.

97
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,200
It is the best place to gain experience.

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,610
You're starting to sound like the perfect mentor, Numazu!

99
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,200
There you go again... still treating me like a newbie.

100
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,810
No, I'm appreciative! We're always working together, aren't we?

101
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,610
- That's right! Because I'm on Team Kisugi!
- Come on.

102
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,970
It means I often work with Dr. Kisugi.

103
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,100
That reminds me, Sakura. You'll be on Team Tendo. Good luck.

104
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,900
- Team Tendo?
- You seem to have a connection with him.

105
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,800
Look after him for me on and off duty.

106
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,850
Am I really the right person for that?

107
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,000
Man, I would like to work with Sakura. Why do I have Numazu?

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,690
Hey! That's not what you've said before!

109
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,910
It's fine! Dr. Kisugi is so mild-mannered, no matter what.

110
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:25,100
But Tendo is so cold and unfriendly. I know he's a skilled doctor,

111
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,910
but he's a sharp tongue and everyone's afraid of him, so...

112
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,750
I want him to mellow out like a normal human-being.

113
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,100
- Sir!
- He's super sadistic, isn't he?

114
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,800
- Dr. Tendo is skilled, but his personality...
- Miss Hero.

115
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,520
But right now, I just have to do the best I can at work.

116
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,400
If I don't, the sadistic devil will eat me alive...

117
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,310
The sadistic devil?

118
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,920
- Dr. Tendo!
- How long have you been listening?

119
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,740
From "Tendo is so cold and unfriendly".

120
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,380
You see this? This is what I was talking about!

121
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,380
Time for rounds, Dr. Tendo? Go on, Miss Hero!

122
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,230
Okay!

123
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,060
Go, Team Tendo!

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,580
Listen. I'm in a bad mood because I didn't get to eat breakfast.

125
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,400
Your usual cream pan? They're so good,

126
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,560
when they're freshly baked...

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,300
- If you're going to work with me, follow these rules.
- Okay!

128
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,400
- First, be sincere to the patients. Don't be unpleasant.
- Okay!

129
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,700
- Consider how you should act on your own initiative.
- Okay!

130
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,200
- Last, don't expect anything from me.
- Excuse me?

131
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,900
There's not even a 0.0001% chance of anything happening between us.

132
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,270
I'm rejecting you in advance.

133
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,510
But, Doctor, I don't think anything is absolute in this world.

134
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,000
So for you to say 0.0001% chance,

135
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,620
I know I'm not a catch, but still, 0.0001% seems a little—

136
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,030
Never.

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,580
Okay.

Starting today, I'm officially assigned to the Cardiology Department.

142
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm Sakura on Team Tendo!

143
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,620
What do you mean by "team"?

144
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,210
We've heard all about it, Doctor!

145
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,990
You've already wooed the cute, new nurse. I'm so jealous! What a lady-killer!

146
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,190
Oh, no! He's already rejected me.

147
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,180
- What? Really?
- Stop gibbering and get to work.

148
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,040
What a terrifying stare.

149
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,410
Mr. Kanda, are you still having shortness of breath?

150
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,610
It's gotten a lot better since I got the diuretics.

Let me listen to it real quick.

I'm so sorry!

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,110
Sorry about that.

154
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,230
Actually... I was recently rejected, too.

155
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,450
You were?

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,050
- Yu-chan?
- I worked at the appliance counter

159
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,140
selling washing machines and refrigerators.

160
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,880

161

Yeah.

162

After work, I mustered out my courage to ask her out to dinner.

163

She agreed. Then on the way home,

164
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,220
I collapsed. I haven't talked to her since then.

165
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,600
You should ask her out again after you get discharged!

166
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
That's right! I'm sure she's waiting for you.

167

Excuse me.

Doctor, Mr. Sugamo has a fever.

170

171
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,010
Okay.

172
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,720
We'll draw some blood and look for any bacteria in the blood.

173
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,260
Okay.

174

That's right! May I confirm your name?

Okay.

I'm disinfecting the area.

Why are you sighing? Is this really safe?

180

You did it, Sakura!

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm actually pretty good at placing needles!

183
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,320

Are we talking about baseball or soccer?

Did you prick yourself with a needle?

188
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm sorry. I was so nervous, it just slipped out.

189
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,630
Didn't take long for you to mess up, did it?

190
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,500
Submit an incident report to the infection control room right away.

191
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,200
Okay! But I'm really fine as you can see.

192

What's so fine about this, rock?

Listen. I did rounds without having breakfast,

194

Yes. I'm sorry for the trouble.

An atrioventricular block?

205
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,280
It's happening frequently.

206
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,700
There's a slight fluid buildup in his lungs, too. We should put in a pacemaker.

207
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,880
The tests show PVC and NSVT, too.

208
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,880
It's hard to say what'll happen. We have to be careful.

209

We may not have as much time as we thought...

210

We're concerned over Kanda's lack of appetite.

211
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,600
Right. It's been like that for a while.

212
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,780
Kanda is still young, and he collapsed so unexpectedly.

213
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,970
Maybe the situation hasn't quite sunk into his head.

214
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:35,700
- He's going into surgery soon. We have to build up his strength.
- Yes.

215
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,380
I've conducted an assessment on Kanda-san's lack of appetite.

216

Whoa! Our model student strikes again!

217
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,280
The cause is likely his increased anxiety over his condition.

218
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,100
We should consult with the doctors to adjust his dosage.

- Right.

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,210
Nanako, what's wrong?

478
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,500
Nanako! Nanako, are you okay? Nanako!

479
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,430
Nanako-chan, are you alright?

480
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,170
I'll leave this here.

481
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,220
I'll leave her in your care.

482
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,040
You haven't had a proper meal, have you?

483
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,410
Slight fever. Pale. Low blood sugar too, I presume?

484
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,820
Go back to sleep.

485
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,440
Farewells could be painful sometimes.

486
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,990
I know it's tough.

487
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,350
I still can't believe it.

488
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,310
Kanda is gone...

489
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,410
Are you feeling unwell?

490
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,770
I'll ask Yu out to a pork cutlet restaurant.

491
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,120
That makes me feel at ease.

492
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,690
He said when he gets discharged,

493
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,720
he wanted to go right back to work.

494
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:12,240
He wanted to go to a restaurant that serves fresh and crispy pork cutlets.

495
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,010
He was going to recommend me the best rice cooker.

496
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,150
But, in the end...

497
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:32,800
all I could do was watch him die.

498
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,320
I'm totally useless.

499
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,220
You were right about me.

500
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,260
I'm not cut out for this.

501
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm going to quit.

502
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,550
I've never though it would be so hard.

503
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,390
I will quit.

504
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,990
Everyone feels the same way.

505
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,680
All of us...

506
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,390
are tormented now.
