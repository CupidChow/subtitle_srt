00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,030
So I came up with the lovely name to praise your courage. It's totally out of respect!

162
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,930
So that's why you're "hero"...

163
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm so sorry for causing trouble!

164
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,300
I got so caught up and excited, but I just made everyone uncomfortable...

165
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,380
- Oh no, it was hilarious!
- What?

166
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,800
No, we were all just saying how you have good taste in men!

167
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Sure! I mean, Dr. Tendo is the top dog of this department!

168
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,300
You've fallen for such an obviously good guy! Right?!

169
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,000
B-But I thought before you called him the "devil"...

170
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,400
The devil... is a handsome prince!

171
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,600
Last time you just happened to catch him after an operation, so he was a little tired.

172
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,950
He's normally so gentle, and when he's around animals they surround him, meowing and barking...

173
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,700
He's the kindest doctor you'll find!

174
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,400
- Really?!
- Of course!

175
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,040
[Anri Shirahama]

176
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,920
As the doctor explained, you will be taking a Cardiopulmonary Stress Test.

177
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,780
A Cardiopulmonary Stress Test is where we

178
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,300
- look at your heart and endurance during exercise—
- I know, give it to me.

179
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,800
I bombed it right out the gate.

180
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,610
Don't worry about it, Nishi!

181
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,350
I'm fine drawing blood, but I panicked when it came out so unexpectedly...

182
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,640
We only just started, though. Let's keep our spirits up!

183
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,640
What's up? Are you feeling better?

184
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,990
They said Dr. Tendo really is a kind, princely doctor, after all!

185
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,400
Really?

186
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,840
Miss Hero! Miss Hero!

187
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,220
Perfect timing! This way, come on!

188
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,000
Look over there.

189
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,820
- Doctor! They told me I might get discharged.
- Yeah.

190
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,600
We'll do some tests, but if the results come back clear, you should be able to leave.

191
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,630
If I get out, I have to go back to the chorus club. The competition is soon!

192
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,170
That's amazing! You know...

193
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm totally tone-deaf.

194
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,160
What? Really? I want to hear you sing!

195
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,290
That smile...

196
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,840
He's really the same as before!

197
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,370
See? Didn't I tell you? He's charming when he smiles!

198
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,490
Do you have a second, Doctor? I wanted to introduce someone to you.

199
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,100
- I'm very sorry.
- Anri.

200
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,700
- Shall we head back?
- Yeah.

201
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,180
Excuse us. This is one of the newbies starting training today, Miss Hero—

202
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,540
Miss Sakura!

203
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,400
I want to apologize for what I blurted out this morning! I'm very sorry!

204
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,290
- Why are you smiling?
- Excuse me?

205
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,440
It's gross.

206
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,200
He's hopeless! How can he just say things like that?

207
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Gross? What does he mean by that?

208
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,300
He really is the devil, isn't he?

209
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,410
What? You finally found out?

210
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,890
I've heard loads more. He's exacting, strict, dolls out punishments for mistakes...

211
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,810
Nurses are always asking to change departments...

212
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,490
Miss Hero, you'll worry the patients with a face like that.

213
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,670
I guess I really don't have a good eye for things.

214
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,850
Then why did I become a nurse?

215
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,890
No, let's not think about that.

216
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,660
Excuse me, are you feeling unwell?

217
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,420
Oh, I'm fine! I'm sorry for worrying you.

218
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,020
But despite how he appears, he's very kind to his patients.

219
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,270
His instructions are concise, and he has good judgment.

220
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,600
I find him easy to work with.

221
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,100
You're talking about Dr. Tendo?!

222
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,800
- Mr. Sugamo, how's your chest feeling?
- Oh, Doctor...

223
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,200
- I've been feeling heaviness here since this morning.
- That's okay, you can stay there.

224
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,430
- Let me listen to your chest.
- Thank you.

225
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,360
Mr. Kanda, can I see your injury?

226
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,110
- It's here.
- Okay.

227
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,110
- Please, disinfect it.
- Okay!

228
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,180
When you fainted from arrhythmia, you hit the stairs, right?

229
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,190
You know a lot!

230
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,080
I've done all my homework. Excuse me.

Mitsuki Kanda, 24 years old. Admitted two days ago for arrhythmia.

232
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,630
Scolded last night for hiding and listening to music in the middle of the night.

233
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,630
I'll be more careful from now on.

234
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,000
- I'm disinfecting the area now.
- Okay.

235
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,600
Miss Hero, that's not clean!

236
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,400
Now, none of these it's clean.

237
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Remembering what's clean and dirty is basic knowledge to nursing.

238
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,080
I'm sorry! I'll be more careful from now on!

239
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,220
I don't think there's a problem, but we'll do a test to be sure.

240
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,210
- Mr. Sugamo needs to do an EKG.
- Sakura will assist.

241

Go quickly.

242
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,330
For now, try to get him to acknowledge you as a nurse.

243
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,840
He's not really the devil, it's just a mask.

244
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,820
- He's not?
- Of course!

245
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,100
Behind his seemingly harsh, strict appearance lies the real Dr. Tendo!

246

- The real Dr. Tendo?
- That's right!

Whether you see it is up to you. Win his trust!

The real Dr. Tendo...

Right... I had a crush on him for the past five years, after all.

250
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,260
I'll break through the mask!

- Why?!

Early morning operations,

We're certainly working you hard.

Quite exploitative, wouldn't you say?

297
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,710
But you shouldn't converse energy by mistreating your colleagues.

298

Be nice towards the newbies.

299

Win him over?

You can't all of a sudden get better at being a nurse...

Did you know that Tendo has a huge sweet tooth?

315
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,920
I don't like sweets very much, by the way.

Today, on my way to work,

318
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,200
a guy was selling really popular shu cream and only had one box left.
(T/N: japanese cream puffs)

319
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,620
Thank goodness! There's one left.

320
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,880
Someone was about to buy it or get it, so I ended it buying it first.

321
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,760
And I don't even like sweet things.

322
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,300
It was like I felt some sort of rivalry or competitive instinct...

323
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,780
Don't you think that idea is effective?

324
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,660
- Effective?
- I'll deliberately pretend to like you,

325
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,930
and spark Tendo's competitive instinct.

326
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,910
We'll call it "Operation Shu Cream."

327
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,060
I see... I get it!

328
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,270
Roger that! Okie Dokie! You're a lifesaver!

329
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,300
You act a little old-fashioned.

330
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,360
It's because I lived with my grandparents.

331
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,290
Dr. Kisugi, I appreciate your kindness.

332
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,150
Oh? What's up Kisugi?

333
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,450
- Did Sakura make a mistake?
- Oh, no.

334
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,020
Actually, I wanted to cheer her on.

335
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,040
Oh, that's right.

336
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Here's some shu cream I bought this morning.

337
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,020
Ah! I know those! They just started selling in Japan!

338
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,000
Have as much as you want.

339
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,300
Thank you!

340
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,000
- Thank you so much!
- This is the best!

341
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,270
- I was craving for sweets.
- Dr. Kisugi is thoughtful as usual.

342
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,960
He's always been a calculating guy.

343
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,190
Doesn't matter if he's calculating, careless, lecherous... although that would be pretty funny, huh?

344
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,900
But regardless, Kisugi's popular.

345
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,240
And I'm not popular.

346
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:52,030
There are lots of emergencies in cardiology. And with reading EKG's and all the tests, it's highly specialized.

347
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,760
The young kids shun the hard work and quit left and right.

348
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,940
Our goal this year...

349
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,470
Is to not let anyone quit.

350
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,200
That's right. So be nice. I'm counting on you.

351
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,320
In ten seconds, we'll go up another level.

352
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,050
[Kanda: Arrhythmia. Seemed like a nice guy!]

353
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,900
[Cardiology Staff Station]

354
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,330
Mr. Kanda, Is there something wrong?

355
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,950
I can't... breathe...

356
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,540
I'll be right there!

357
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,660
Doctor, please help!

358
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,710
Why is a freaking newbie the only one here?

359
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,740
I know I'm a newbie, but I passed the National Exam, you know!

360
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,540
And my name is Sakura!

361
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,900
Then come along, newbie.

362
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,890
- Mr. Kanda, the doctor is here!
- Are you okay, Mr. Kanda? Pardon me. Are you alright?

363
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,640
- Start the IV.
- Okay!

364
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,120
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me!

365
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,270
Administer the oxygen first!

366
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,520
Okay!

367
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,100
You'll feel a lot better soon, Kanda. Just a moment.

368
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,300
Pardon me.

369
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,270
- Connect it.
- Okay!

370
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,820
- Hurry.
- Okay!

371
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
- Enough, move!
- Sorry!

372
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,100
Excuse me.

373
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,090
Gently clench your hand.

374
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,030
- I'm very sorry.
- I'm very sorry.

375
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,160
It was my fault for leaving her alone.

376
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,320
No, it was my incompetence.

377
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,490
- I panicked and I—
- Just quit.

378
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,930
You're not cut out for this.

379
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,300
- I'm sorry, I—
- You followed me here? To this hospital?

380
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,560
- I wanted to treat patients like you—
- I don't care!

381
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,750
We look after people. Save lives. I don't care about anything else.

382
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,240
The patients come first. Get out of here before you do real harm.

383
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,420
- Let's help out with bathing and the rounds.
- Okay.

384
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,300
- Coming, Sakai?
- Yeah.

385
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,000
The fourth one...

386
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,860
The fourth what?

387
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Anri, right?

388
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,600
I'm Sakura.

389
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,100
I'm training in cardiology right now, but I keep making mistakes—

390
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,310
Come here.

391
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,300
This is my secret hiding place.

392
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,500
I heard the new people come here to cry.

393
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,090
It looks like you're the first one this year.

394
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,940
Here you go!

395
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,230
Thank you.

396
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,900
Hold on! Just a little more.

397
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,500
A cat...

398
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,770
This one, please!

399
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:02,710
It's alright now, thanks to you.

400
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,420
I finally became a nurse, but I'm useless at it.

401
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:20,060
Everyone grows a little after crying. Hang in there, Sakura.

402
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,500
You're so wise, Anri!

403
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,200
It's because I'm the leader of the chorus club! I'm also the secretary of the student council.

404
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,600
There's so much I want to do after I get out of here!

405
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,790
You're getting discharged? Congratulations!

406
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,650
You can always come to me if anything happens.

407
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,830
I'll pull myself together so I can listen to your troubles next time!

408
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,300
Oh! You'll be training in pediatrics too, right? I'll introduce you to everyone!

409
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,510
What?

410
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,490
Kengo's like my little brother! He has cardiomyopathy too, but his is hypertrophic.

411
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Anri always helps me with my studies.

412
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,960
Asuka is super girly, and Mirei was just recently admitted.

413
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,730
And Kanta's a little shy!

414
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,230
That's amazing, Anri! You're like the head of pediatrics!

415
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,730
- I finished.
- Really? That was quick!

416
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,260
Good work today.

417
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,800
- Anri brought you here?
- Yes.

418
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,590
She first came here when she was six.

419
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,770
She's been in and out a lot.

420
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,170
This time we weren't quite able to get her heart failure under control.

421
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,070
She's been here for three months.

422
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,180
But thanks to you, she can go home.

423
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,000
[Discharge!]

424
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,030
Oh? Why are you here, Sakura?

425
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,230
Hey, Dr. Sayoko!

426
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,730
I think Nishi would do well in pediatrics!

427
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,710
Really? He got a passing score?

428
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,700
But he's unreliable if there is unexpected blood.

429
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,710
You didn't have to go that far, Anri.

430
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,500
You just have to get more experience. Keep at it, newbies.

431
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,450
- Yes.
- Yes.

432
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,190
Whoa! You got full marks!

433
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,890
Look! Isn't it great?

434
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,300
I hope they all recover.

435
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,500
We have to get better... to help them get better.

436
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,290
Yeah.

437
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,400
Alright.

438
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,820
You're fine. It's no big deal.

439
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,190
Please, don't hurt me.

440
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,200
Please help me! I beg of you!

441
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,560
And now, the sinner's operation will begin!

442
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,400
No, no, no!

443
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,300
Sorry.

444
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,900
The blood was so realistic.

445
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,950
No, I'm sorry. It's not what you think.

446
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,100
- I was trying to get this off.
- Oh...

447
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,220
I was the one that threw them during the movie. I freak out when blood spurts out.

448
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,900
Even though I work in a hospital...

449
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,380
- A hospital?
- Yes.

450
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,310
I'm a nurse... for the time being.

451
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:53,470
So I-I'm not some creep. I'm sorry for startling you.

452
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,670
Here.

453
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,530
Pardon?

454
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,440
Good luck with your job.

455
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Great work today, Sakura.

456
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,300
Do you want to get drinks?

457
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,180
I thought I had worked hard these past five years...

458
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,630
I wonder why I'm a complete loser in front of patients.

459
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:06,400
Things are way different in real life than they are in the textbooks.

460
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,750
When we're done with training, we submit our preferences, right?

461
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,040
Are you going to go with cardiology?

462
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,690
I'm not sure...

463
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,790
I don't care where I go as long as I can do the work.

464
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,740
I just want a steady paycheck for the rest of my life.

465
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,980
I was a sick kid, always in and out of hospitals.

466
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,700
My nurse back then was very capable. I really admired her.

467
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,890
She must have been like you, Sakai.

468
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Everyone praised that you are an effective workforce to the team.

469
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm so envious.

470
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,700
- I'm envious of you, Sakura.
- What?

471
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,220
My mom was a nurse, but she's not anymore. She was sued over a medical error.

472
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,780
A medical error?

473
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,580
She was crushed.

474
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:56,660
That's why I wanted to be an excellent nurse, to make her proud.

00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,580
It's not just treating the sickness...

638
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,760
We support people in order for them to keep living.

639
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,650
That's the kind of place the hospital is.

640
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:07,730
I wonder why I forgot?

641
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:12,030
What a shame. That was pretty impressive.

Great job today, Miss Sakura.

645
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:32,480
Dr. Kisugi! You must be tired.

646
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,140
So we're still on for Operation Shu Cream?

647
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,220
Thank you!

648
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,440
But... why would you go so far to help me?

649
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,840
Well... I'd like to see the hero defeat the devil.

650
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,400
And so... I'll grant you a sword!

651
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,220
Thank you, wise sage!

653
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,920
What a crazy day. You must be exhausted.

654
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,820
Yeah... But I'm alright!

655
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:14,680
- Really? Don't overdo it.
- Okay!

656
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,010
Good night.

657
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,800
Dr. Tendo!

658
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:32,020
I'm going to submit cardiology as my preferred placement!

659
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,320
Oh? Even though you didn't do well at all?

660
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:40,110
- I think I might have some hidden potential.
- I have the right to choose, too.

661
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:43,550
Plus, after training, everyone was telling me,

662
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,020
"Come here! You have to! We'll wait for you!"

663
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,070
- They were just being polite.
- Besides...

664
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:58,160
Setting aside your true personality... I think I like you as a doctor.

665
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,550
Setting aside my true personality?

666
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,030
You've got no right to say that.

667
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:12,780
Anyway... I was hoping you would retrain me!

668
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:19,260
Someone useless joining the department will only increase the workload.

669
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,250
- Then make me useful!
- Why does that punishment fall to me?

670
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:30,230
You grumble, but I think you really want a super rookie like me that can jump into action on your team!

671
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,780
I'll schedule you for a brain wave scan tomorrow.

672
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:37,000
- Want to see the brain waves of a super rookie?
- Listen!

673
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,660
I'll kick you out the second you get in my way...

674
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:44,920
Just how long are you going to follow me?

675
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,030
Doctor, why did you come here?

676
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,310
- What? This is my place.
- What?!

677
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:54,890
This is my place.

678
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:59,290
I did hear someone was moving into the next unit.

679
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:08,160
Welcome home, Kairi! I thought you would never come home.

680
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:13,530
Oh? Is this our neighbor? Do you know her?

681
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,150
Unfortunately...

682
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,300
Well... Good night!

683
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Dear God... What on earth is this?!
