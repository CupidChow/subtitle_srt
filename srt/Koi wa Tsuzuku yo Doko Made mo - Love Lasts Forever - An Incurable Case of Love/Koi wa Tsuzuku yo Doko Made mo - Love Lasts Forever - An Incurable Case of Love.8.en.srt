Physical assault? Instigated by Tendo?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,240
Our client, Mr. Kamijo, claims that the day he consulted Dr. Tendo about his further treatments,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,570
they got into an argument and Dr. Tendo punched him.

What happened?

14
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,290
Dr. Tendo, what on earth happened here?

15
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,260
I did not punch Mr. Kamijo.

16
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:21,230
These are the bruises left by Dr. Tendo's attack.

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,750
How would you explain these bruises, Doctor?

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,970
There's no way Tendo would harm a patient.

19
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,380
Absolutely not. I'm sure of it.

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,520
Due to the incident, I immediately checked Mr. Kamijo's physical condition.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,000
However, there was no such bruise to be found.

What does that mean?

24
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,230
I see now. That means Mr. Kamijo, in an effort to pin the blame on Dr. Tendo,

25
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,960
punched himself after he was set on suing.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,180
Mr. Kamijo then turned that in as evidence. Case closed.

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,820
Dr. Tendo didn't seem to get along with Mr. Kamijo.

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,300
Perhaps Mr. Kamijo felt some sort of resentment.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,700
But to sue for that reason alone... How petty.

30
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,870
Mr. Kamijo will be ejecting any and all examinations by Tendo.

31

Shouldn't you get a lawyer? Should I consult about it with our parents?

00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,800
I see...

485
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:12,020
My plan is to train here and become a capable nurse.

486
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,830
So...

you don't need to worry about me anymore.

00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:27,180
♫ I love, I love, so many times ♫

Doctor?

491
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,950
Don't go disappearing on me.

492
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:49,730
♫ Like paints diving into a water tank and melting, irregular ♫

493
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:56,420
♫ I wouldn't have noticed such vivid colors ♫

494
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,290
Didn't you say you'd stay with me forever?

495
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,210
♫ You feigned ignorance ♫

496
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:09,140
♫ And said it’s normal ♫

497
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:19,380
♫ I love… let me finish what I started to saying to you ♫

498
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:34,310
♫ We accept each other as the nameless night goes on ♫
