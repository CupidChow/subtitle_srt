00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,650
I'm here for you.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,090
I like you.

3
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,020
I-I appreciate it.

4
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,550
Dr. Kisugi, I... really...

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,380
really admire you.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,200
You're someone I completely trust.

7
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,400
But...

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,770
I...

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,110
I fell in love with you

11
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,540
because of the way you are, Sakura.

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,370
Go talk to Tendo face-to-face.

13
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,150
Here you are. See you tomorrow.

14
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:07,510
I've... fallen for you.

15
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,110
What's wrong?

16
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,430
Miori...

17
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,330
loves you, doesn't she?

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,330
I think you two are a perfect match.

19
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,650
Miori is beautiful, brilliant,

20
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,890
and everyone likes her.

21
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,190
As for me,

22
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,210
I'm forgetful at work, a lously drunk, and I doze off.

23
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,180
I have no redeeming qualities.

24
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,390
It seems...

25
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,760
we're not a good match at all.

26
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,520
Don't you think it's too late to be saying that now?

27
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,130
I've known we weren't a good match

28
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,940
for a million years.

29
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,000
A million?

I'm home! Listen to this, Kairi—

Oh... I'm leaving.

33
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,410
Hold on! I was just leaving.

34
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,310
- Why are you leaving?
- Pardon?

35
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,810
It was all me.

36
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,450
What was?

37
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,700
Getting worked up, then getting jealous and depressed.

38
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,320
I'm a good-for-nothing.

I wonder...

41

Is there anyone who can stay composed when they're in love?

42
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,410
Oh, right. Look at what I got!

43
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,900
Tada, tada, tada! Isn't it great?

44

Where were you drinking?

50
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,930
Use them to go on a date! It's for a botanical park or something.

51
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,210
It says "amusement park."

52
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,950
Really? Well, a park is a park... It should be fun!

53
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,460
I don't have time for that.

54
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,710
Then it's decided! Go the next day you have off!

55
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,090
An amusement park date with Dr. Tendo.

56
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,840
Wait... I haven't said yes!

57
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,630
Then hurry and say it, stupid! Idiot!

58

Sorry, but could we have a chat?

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,990
Sure.

66
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,530
I thought I should come out and tell you.

67
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,440
I've... fallen for you.

68
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,850
I'm dating someone.

69
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,360
I know.

70
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,560
But I just...

71
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,900
I believe I could be the partner you need.

72
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,080
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,990
A single blow...

74
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,840
But it sparked a fire in me!

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,220
When I find someone, I pursue them. I don't give up.

76
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,180
And I've decided on him.

77

Sorry for telling you this.

78

It's fine.

79

I just thought it was better than sneaking behind your back.

Yes?

82
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,670
I wasn't lying last night, Sakura. I do love you.

83
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,320
But I want Tendo to be happy just as much.

84
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,770
So I'll continue being your greatest confidant, just like before.

You probably don't know this, but I'm pretty popular.

What? You don't believe me?

88

You know, they call Tendo and me the "Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio of cardiology."

What was that again?

Well... who's who?

92
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,520
It's a secret.

93
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,420
What? No way...

Break up? Why?

Just give me a reason!

- What?

100

So... sorry! Just forget about me!

101

What? Why her out of all people?

102
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,790
You have poor taste in women.

You look great! It really suits you.

104

I'll pay for this.

105
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,830
Don't worry about it. It was totally my fault.

The 790-yen apple!

111
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,000
I wanted one because it was so cute

112
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,170
but 790 yen was a little pricey.

113

No, thank you. I'm in a hurry.

114

Okay?

I would definitely pay 790 yen for this. No...

121
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,990
I don't mind paying even 800 yen!

He's wonderful, and he's capable at work, too.

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,430
He sounds terrible.

132
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,670
But apparently, we're not a good match.

133
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,410
It's been decided a million years ago.

134
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,450
Then why not just become his perfect match?

135

You're right.

It was a fun date, wasn't it?

164
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,170
Date?

165
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,160
Don't tell me you two were...

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,410
No, no, no! It wasn't anything like that!

170
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,010
I've heard about you from the director.

171
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,740
Hi.

172
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,950
This will be your attending physician...

173
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm Tendo.

174
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,090
- He's the best doctor in the department?
- Yes.

175
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,800
Nice to meet you. I chose this hospital because of you.

176
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,500
Let's both give our best effort.

177
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,270
Oh, right...

178
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,490
Can Nanase be my exclusive nurse?

179
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,210
What?

180
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,010
Sakura?

181
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,110
We can't really assign one nurse to you exclusively—

182
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,890
You don't mind it, do you, Head Nurse?

183
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,800
It won't be a problem at all.

184
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,000
Good! Let's be friends, Nanase.

185
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,360
Sakura.

186
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll do my best to look after you. I look forward to it.

187
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,920
Just to clear things up, I did not go on a date with Kamijo.

188
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,080
I ran into him yesterday and got a drink thrown at me!

189
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
What?

190
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,050
From the smell, it was probably ice tea.

191
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,160
Kamijo, what's happened?

192
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,370
Okay, I'll be right there!

193
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,270
Chikashi Kamijo, 25 years old.

194
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,450
Aortic arch syndrome?

195
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,770
Yes, and it has become quite complex.

196
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,180
You'd normally go with bypass surgery over catheterization, right?

197
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,370
Normally, yes.

198
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,720
It's the patient's wishes.

199
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,420
Since he was diagnosed at age ten, he's been in and out of hospitals for nearly fifteen years.

200
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,190
He's had open heart surgery twice

201
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,690
and he had an operation performed by a famous surgical professor a year ago.

202
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,080
- Sorry for the wait!
- You're slow. It took you two minutes and fifty-three seconds.

203
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,510
Sorry! I did hurry over here.

204
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,030
Is something the matter?

205
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,400
I was just bored.

206
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,360
That's not really...

207
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,060
So he wants a catheter instead of another operation?

208
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,660
It's a difficult case, but if we remove the calcification and use DCB,
(T/N: Drug-coated balloon)

209
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,800
we should lower the risk of re-treatment.

210
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,000
Got it. I'll be on stand-by that day.

211
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,580
Thank you.

212
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,710
Excuse me.

213
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,250
So it's Dr. Tendo, right?

214
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,600
What?

215
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,970
The wonderful boyfriend you mentioned when we met.

216
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,020
I cannot answer that.

217
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,940
It's not something you have to hide.

218
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,850
What's wrong?

219
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,350
My scar hurts.

220
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,160
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

221
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,140
I'm fine. The pain will subside soon.

222
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,900
There. It's gone.

223
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm glad.

224
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,470
If you need me, call me anytime.

225
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,100
Anytime?

226
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,590
Sure.

227
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,100
Good evening! I'm coming in.

228
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,780
What happened?

229
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,950
- Look, this is nuts!
- What?

230
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,030
This scene is crazy!

231
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,170
A movie...?

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Thank you!

233
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,320
Miss Hero!

234
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,800
Yes?

235
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,190
Wow, that's a feast.

236
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,570
Who brought these?

237
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,900
- It's a present from Kamijo.
- What?

238
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,500
As expected from a rich son. He is so generous!

239
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,530
Good afternoon.

240
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,010
Miss Hero! Come look at this!

241
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,280
What's that? How awesome!

242
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,020
Wait. Don't tell me...

243
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,270
It's a donation from Kamijo! Everyone's so happy!

244
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,840
It finally turned into...

245
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,820
A son of a rich family is so generous!

246
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,590
Good afternoon.

247
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,830
Excuse me.

248
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,400
You're really good at this.

249
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh, right! You guys can go to this if you want.

250
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,150
- Seriously?
- What is that?

251
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,200
It's a present from you, Chikashi?

252
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,400
- Kamijo, can I take your temperature—
- Oh, Miss Hero! These are my friends.

253
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,370
It's a pass to Universal Studio Japan! Even tickets for the plane and hotel!

254
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,000
Send me pictures! It'll feel like I went there, too.

255
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,890
I'll send them! Thank you, Chikashi! I love you.

256
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm so happy.

257
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,600
How is going with the rich kid?

258
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,950
- He's kind of a celebrity in the hospital.
- Yeah.

259
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm grateful he made those donations for the kids,

260
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,500
but I wonder why he spends money so recklessly.

261
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,230
Because he has a ton of it?

262
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,400
But he's just a son of a company president.

263
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,180
It's not like he does anything himself.

264
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,590
But you know... I kind of get it.

265
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,320
Not about the money,

266
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,100
but I think he feels anxious.

267
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,930
Anxious?

268
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:13,210
People who have nothing to offer, don't know how to win other's affection.

269
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,920
People who have nothing?

270
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,830
[Cardiology Staff Station]

271
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,460
What's wrong?

272
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,790
Dr. Tendo, are you still working at this hour?

273
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,300
Yes.

274
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,320
It must be hard for doctors since there is no time to enjoy personal lives.

275
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,800
That must be why Nanase looked like she had so much fun when we first met!

276
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,550
We just went clothes shopping and ate a candied apple,

277
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,850
but it was kind of like a date.

278
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,200
Anyway, sorry for always keeping your girlfriend to myself.

279
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,810
Not at all. Patients normally feel anxious while they're here.

280
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,520
You can talk to the nurses about anything.

281
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
Pardon me.

282
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,310
Doctor.

283
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,780
I've been waiting for you.

284
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,350
You look excited.

285
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,100
Obviously! I'm at an amusement park with you!

286
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,080
I hate crowds.

287
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,200
Don't say that! We've come all the way here...

288
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,390
I've come up with a plan for us to conquer all the rides!

289
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,830
All the rides?

290
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,890
Well, let's get started!

291
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,140
The first one is... the Coffee Cups!

292
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,000
Doctor, pick up the pace!

293
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
What's that string?

294
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,560
It's coming from your back.

295
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,050
No way! What's going on here?

296
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,880
You're really something.

297
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,430
I appreciate the compliment.

298
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,720
It wasn't a compliment.

299
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,460
Amusement parks are awesome, don't you think?

300
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,030
Are you okay, Doctor?

301
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,530
Why wouldn't I be?

302
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,910
Here you go!

303
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,720
Let's eat!

304
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,140
It's so good!

305
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,700
I'm not going to wipe that off.

306
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,360
Wipe what off?

307
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,540
How pretty!

308
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,430
I can see so far away! Right, Doctor?

309
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,970
- Doctor, what's wrong?
- Don't move!

310
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,920
Don't move a muscle.

311
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,870
Don't tell me... are you scared of heights?

312
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,820
Of course not, you idiot.

313
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,590
I said not to move!

314
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,640
Sit down.

315
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,260
Okay.

316
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:29,550
Doctor... you said before

317
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:36,960
"There was a 0.0001% chance of something happen between us."

318
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,930
Did I say that?

319
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,620
Yes, you did!

320
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:49,800
But this is that 0.0001% chance, isn't it?

321
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,150
Us being together, on a Ferris wheel date at an amusement park.

322
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:07,070
This is a 0.0001% miracle!

323
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,370
Good evening.

324
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,930
Good work today.

325
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,550
Good work.

326
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,160
Good work.

327
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,130
Why did you say it twice?

328
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,590
It's just...

329
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,620
you looked like you were worrying over something.

330
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,030
Over what I should eat.

331
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,170
I was debating whether to eat a Genma Onigiri or a Curry pan.
(T/N: brown rice ball and curry bread)

332
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,560
I like both, though.

333
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,660
I like...!

334
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,420
What?

335
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,630
Onigiri and Curry pan.

336
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,250
I like both, too.

337
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,880
It's a tough choice, right?

338
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,470
Hello, Kamijo! What's wrong?

339
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,430
Nanase...

340
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,530
I'll be right there!

341
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,870
Excuse me! Kamijo?

342
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,600
- It's my chest...
- Are you alright?

343
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,060
Let's lie down. Just lean back.

344
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,020
It'll be okay. A doctor will be here soon.

345
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,500
Kamijo, are you okay? Nitroglycerin.

346
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,050
- Okay.
- Are you all right?

347
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,170
- Here you go.
- I'm giving you some nitroglycerin.

348
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,140
- Do an electrocardiogram.
- Okay!

349
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,750
You'll feel better soon.

350
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,370
Angina at rest, CCS Grade 4?
(T/N: Canadian Cardiovascular Society)

351
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,720
His condition is becoming unstable.

352
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,310
- Let's expedite his treatment.
- Yes.

353
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,190
The patient is very shaken up, worrying over when the next attack will be.

354
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,320
There is a lot to process mentally, too.

355
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,860
I'll continue providing bedside care as often as I can.

356
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,590
We'll provide backup, too.

357
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,780
[Hiura General Hospital, Dr. Kairi Tendo]

358
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,300
What's wrong?

359
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,080
Are you feeling unwell?

360
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,600
Not really. There's no problem.

361
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,720
Things have gotten a little crazy with the VIP here.

362
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,890
As for now, we have to provide the best care for Kamijo.

363
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,170
What I'm afraid of is the patient might lose hope.

364
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,050
The way he's treated outside won't translate here.

365
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,730
Illness makes everyone feel equally powerless.

366
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,140
I think that's especially hard for people like Kamijo.

367
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,020
Excuse me.

368
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,110
- What's the matter?
- Nanase.

369
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,150
Open that drawer.

370
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,590
Okay.

371
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,970
Did you want this?

372
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,620
Open it.

373
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,830
That's for you, Nanase.

374
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,450
- I can't accept that!
- It's fine! It's for always treating me so well.

375
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,950
I bet you're annoyed for putting up with my selfish requests.

376
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,650
- I'm not—
- It's fine. Just take it.

377
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,930
It'll look good on you.

378
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,580
I've never been annoyed with you.

379
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,230
It's not like I was forced into being your exclusive nurse.

380
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:42,450
I'd treat you just as attentively if you were staying in our public ward.

381
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,250
Would you?

382
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,070
Of course!

383
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,880
Be with me.

384
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,930
Excuse me?

385
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,280
If you were with me, I'd make any wish come true.

386
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,990
I'd take you anywhere. Give you anything you want.

387
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,060
Kamijo...

388
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,410
I have nothing.

389
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm well aware of that.

390
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:27,220
That's why... I'm alone.

391
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,690
Kamijo...

392
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,810
Kamijo, please stop.

393
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,840
I'll check the puncture site for tomorrow's catheterization.

394
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,160
Gently make a fist.

395
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,750
And open it.

396
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,300
Everything looks fine.

397
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,500
I'll be back again later.

398
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,780
Amazing...

399
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,590
His expression didn't change at all.

400
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,840
Kamijo...

401
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,970
I'll be by your side.

402
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,140
As a nurse, I'll be by your side.

403
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:32,160
Everyone... all these people here want to help you.

404
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:42,920
Didn't you tell me when we first met?

405
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:49,150
When I said Dr. Tendo and I weren't a good match,

406
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,030
you told me to just become his perfect match.

407
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:02,650
Those words inspired me to try even harder.

408
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:10,480
You gave me courage.

409
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,160
So don't think you have nothing.

410
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,660
Excuse me.

411
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,840
Excuse me.

412
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,230
- Doctor... about before with Kamijo—
- I know.

413
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,910
Get back to work.

414
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,990
Okay.

415
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,560
Cool, quiet, and handsome. Isn't that right, Dicaprio?

416
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,630
What?

417
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,600
Refill.

418
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,530
I'll buy you one.

419
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,300
You okay?

420
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,910
What do you mean? I'm totally happy.

421
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,190
The way you drink, tells me you're not happy.

422
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,620
Sorry for the wait.

423
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,880
I might... get married.

424
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,370
What?

425
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,420
What's this?

426
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,940
Marriage candidates.

427
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,090
How old-fashioned...

428
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,340
I was told that if I'm living my life aimlessly and I need to hurry and get married.

429
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,400
I get it.

430
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,200
They don't have to tell me how worthless I am.

431
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:50,740
I think your parents probably just want you to be happy.

432
00:36:52,260 --> 00:37:01,200
Although, I'm not sure if marriage guarantees happiness.

433
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,320
Excuse me.

434
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:24,560
Kamijo, your inflammation is subsided. You can rest easy.

435
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,570
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

436
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,540
What is it that you like?

437
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,130
Pardon?

438
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,310
What is it that you like about her?

439
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,970
Just so you know, she was the one who was friendly with me first.

440
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,430
It's always the quiet ones that flirt with me.

441
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,690
Wagging their tails so excitedly.

442
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,190
Doesn't this type of girls make you wonder?

443
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,660
No matter when you call or what you ask for, they smile and oblige.

444
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,780
- That's the current situation...
- I see.

445
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,280
What happened?

446
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,300
Dr. Tendo, what on earth happened?

447
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,720
What will you do?

448
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,770
Do you want to change doctors for tomorrow's catheterization?

449
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,890
You do it.

450
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,600
We'll move you now.

451
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,010
- Good luck, Kamijo!
- Yeah.

452
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,220
[In use]

453
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,880
Thank you.

454
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,520
- Let's begin.
- Yes.

455
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,750
- Prepare the guiding catheter.
- Okay.

456
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,720
Yes?

457
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,010
Kamijo's operation has just finished successfully.

458
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,980
Okay! I'll be right there.

459
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,830
- Next, please explain the discharge procedure to Tanabe in room 701.
- Okay.

460
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,810
Also, Dr. Tendo has just got home sick.

461
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,960
- Dr. Kisugi and Dr. Koishikawa will take over—
- What?

462
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,060
- You didn't know, Miss Hero?
- No!

463
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,620
You're a failure as his girlfriend.

464
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,690
You're right.

465
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,180
I'll go check up on him after my shift.

466
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,160
That's good.

467
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,600
Your porridge is ready, Doctor.

468
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,950
I told you not to worry about me.

469
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,150
Enough of that! You need to eat.

470
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,830
Here you go!

471
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,810
Where's Ryuko?

472
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,650
She's staying at a hot spring resort for a few nights.

473
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,480
Really?

474
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,000
You work too much!

475
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,650
The Devil neglects his own health.

476
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,890
I don't understand why you look happy.

477
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,590
Sorry!

478
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,690
I've never seen you look so fragile.

479
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,880
What's that supposed to mean?

480
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,590
But I am happy.

481
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,490
I haven't been in the ward recently,

482
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,020
so I'm happy to be taking care of someone.

483
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,260
Could I ask you...

484
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,610
about Minori?

485
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,060
Minori's death...

486
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:13,740
I still feel the fear and pain of losing someone important to me.

487
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,390
I'm sure it'll never go away.

488
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:24,780
As a doctor, I don't think I should get rid of it.

489
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,940
But that's all.

490
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,680
How dare you...

491
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,610
- That weirdo has a soft spot for you.
- What?

492
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,150
What's up with "exclusive nurse"?

493
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,580
I really don't like it. Good night.

494
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,660
Doctor, are you...?

495
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,010
Could you be... jealous?

496
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,220
