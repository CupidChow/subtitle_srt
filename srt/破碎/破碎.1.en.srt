Dammit!

8
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:58,946
What the hell?

9
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,613
Damnit.

10
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,347
Go after him.

11
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:04,138
Son of a gun.

12
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,638
(Oslo Karaoke)

13
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:16,888
Wait a minute.

14
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:19,763
Isn't this Moon-young's karaoke?

15
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,388
That must've been Seok-tae.

16
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,055
He probably got high somewhere.

17
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:31,030
So, should we mess him up today?

18
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:34,680
Not today,
let's do it another day.

19
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,930
Goddamn jerk.

00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:44,430

It's raining, get your laundry!

26
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,930
Min-tae, I think I messed up.

27
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:42,930
Come home.

28
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,513
Freaking idiot.

29
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,821
You made us work,

30
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:21,597
so pay up!

31
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,180
It's already been months!

32
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,847
How can they stiff pay
in this day and age?

33
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,680
Get the boss out here!

34
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,238
I think they'll pay this time,
please go back home.

35
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:39,738
There he is!

36
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:42,196
So many of you are here.

37
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,030
Gents!

38
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,488
It's a cold day,

39
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:49,196
why are you causing
a scene so early?

40
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,988
If we got paid on time,

41
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:51,946
would we be here?

42
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:53,071
Can't you tell?

43
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:54,946
Do you know how much you owe us?

44
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:58,263
I don't know,
how should I know that?

45
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,138
We can't pay right now!

46
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:06,680
Go home and wait,
I'll call you, okay?

47
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,597
Who the hell are you?

48
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,613
Hey.

49
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,805
Don't mess around.

50
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:31,321
At least pay me
half of what you owe.

51
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:33,055
Got it?

52
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,030
I'll leave it up to you, chief.

53
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,097
Yes, sir.

54
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:09,946
(Cha Moon-young - $750)

55
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,653
Please make sure
the recipient is correct.

56
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,722
(To: Moon-young)

57
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,363
(Not a lot of work this month,
sent you half)

58
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,138
(And Seok-tae is not
answering his phone)

59
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,805
I'll give you three days.

60
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:51,946
I don't care about anything,

61
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:54,113
just grab the guy

62
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,430
who was with the CEO's son.

63
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,013
We'll get something out of him.

64
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:02,430
He could've tried to kill him,

65
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,113
or maybe something else.

66
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,905
Three days won't be enough,
I'm short-staffed too.

67
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,805
Capt. Park.

68
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,405
The son of a powerful executive
got knifed and is in a coma,

69
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:18,722
crime scene's full of
drugs and needles,

70
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,738
we have to take care of this

71
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,680
before it leaks,

72
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,946
if this goes upstairs,

73
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,430
we'll have to clean up the mess.

74
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,738
Who's he?

75
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:39,113
Bae Seok-tae, a local gangster,

76
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,030
he was one of
Chang-mo Clan's boys.

77
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:44,363
He was likely with
the CEO's son at the time.

78
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,571
Yeah?

79
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,055
If we grab Bae Seok-tae,
we may get something.

80
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,555
(Cha Moon-young)

81
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:04,405
Any family?

82
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:05,821
He wasn't married

83
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:07,430
but he lived with a woman.

84
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:10,196
She's not reachable either?

85
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:12,780
Intentionally or not,

86
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,347
she's not answering her phone.

87
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,405
His brother had a prior?

88
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:18,863
His name is Bae Min-tae,

89
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,638
he was also part of
the Chang-mo Clan,

90
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,222
but looks like he got out of it.

91
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,988
He wanted a clean slate?

92
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm not sure about that.

93
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,905
But after his release,

94
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,763
he stopped coming around.

95
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,030
Why was he locked up?

96
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:39,847
What's funny is that,

97
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,638
he took it out on the guy
who stabbed Bae Seok-tae.

98
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:47,655
He avenged his brother's
attacker and went to jail?

99
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,488
I heard the younger one
was a roughneck,

100
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:53,013
but Bae Min-tae was
doing well for himself.

101
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:56,638
The younger one causes trouble,
and the older one cleans up.

102
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,180
Beautiful.

103
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,472
Moon-young.

104
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,638
I don't know
what to say about her.

105
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,680
She must be connected to
the man who lived here.

106
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,472
His wife, probably.

107
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,763
Or maybe not.

108
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,722
When was the last time
you saw either of them?

109
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,597
Well,

110
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,321
I rarely got to see them...

111
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,555
(Nocturnal)

112
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:30,930
Did something happen to her?

113
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:33,696
No, it's nothing like that.

114
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:36,763
Why? Would something
happen to her?

115
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:41,113
He'd constantly beat her,

116
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,097
like he owned her.

117
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,388
He was brandishing
a knife recently.

118
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,405
He sounds like a bad guy.

119
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:56,238
He's a scoundrel for sure.

120
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:58,488
She actually had a kid,

121
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,738
but he was so bad to her that

122
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:04,305
she left the kid with a friend
for the sake of the youngster.

123
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,613
Did anyone come by?

124
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,930
Someone sure did.

125
00:15:09,347 --> 00:15:10,196
Who?

126
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:14,763
His brother came by just now.

127
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,638
Why didn't you
tell us that earlier?

128
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,222
When else should I tell you?

129
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,738
Sir.

130
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:29,430
Isn't that Min-tae?

131
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,180
Still working in construction?

132
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,722
Yeah.

133
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,530
Is Seok-tae having
a tough time lately?

134
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,305
Seok-tae?

135
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:00,905
What about him?

136
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:03,388
I can't reach that idiot.

137
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:11,013
He ghosted us one too many times.

138
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,597
Probably hiding out
after causing some trouble.

139
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,930
No problems
with Kang-ho Clan lately?

140
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,013
Buddy.

141
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:29,555
You're not with us anymore,

142
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:32,530
if you suddenly drop in
and interrogate me,

143
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:35,513
should I spill my guts out
to you in vivid detail?

144
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,638
I'll go see Kang-ho's boys
and hear them out.

145
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:46,946
Things are bad around here,

146
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,780
it won't do anyone any good,

147
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:51,805
if you mess with Kang-ho's boys.

148
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,946
Stay put and wait it out,

149
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,430
I'll look into it myself.

150
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:01,222
I didn't come here
to ask you for permission.

151
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,763
Yeah?

152
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,305
Then why are you here?

153
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,680
I thought you should know.

154
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,888
That's it, Min-tae.

155
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,613
That's how you should work,

156
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,930
sharing and helping each other.

157
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,696
You can't head butt

158
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:27,472
whoever on a whim like before.

159
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:32,655
It's time for you
to live a proper life.

160
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,263
Am I right?

161
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,472
Sure, understood.

162
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,347
Good.

163
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:44,680
Do well.

164
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,305
Sir.

165
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,680
Sir!

166
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,446
Stop poking around
looking for Seok-tae.

167
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:09,263
It'll be difficult
to clean up your crap.

168
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,597
What did you say?
I didn't hear you.

169
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:17,321
Honestly, we've been cleaning

170
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,013
after Seok-tae's troubles,

171
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,805
and if you cause more stink,
who's cleaning up that mess?

172
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,180
All right.

173
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,263
Freaking jerk.

174
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,347
Goddammit.

175
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:53,946
You guys head back.

176
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,113
What's wrong, sir?

177
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,738
Just go.

178
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,638
Yes, sir.

179
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:17,597
Young-seob, get over here.

180
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,571
I'll just stay over here,
I can hear you clearly.

181
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:23,013
Get over here,
I can't hear very well.

182
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:37,180
Sir.

183
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:42,222
You know you shouldn't be
in my neck of the woods.

184
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,430
It doesn't matter,
I'm a civilian now.

185
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:50,138
What brings you here?

186
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,472
Have you seen Seok-tae recently?

187
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,263
Seok-tae?

188
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:03,946
Yeah, I saw him in front of
Cha Moon-young's karaoke

189
00:20:04,013 --> 00:20:05,388
a few days ago.

190
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,680
- You sure?
- Yeah.

191
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:12,638
Where's Kang-ho?

192
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,597
Don't look for him.

193
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,847
He's got a lot on his plate.

194
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:22,097
He'll only get worked up
seeing your face.

195
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:27,263
All right, I get it.

196
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:32,763
Bud, I'll be back tomorrow,

197
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,472
so let him know.

198
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,680
What a poser.

199
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:56,847
Don't go too far, Mang-chi!

200
00:21:34,305 --> 00:21:37,680
Blood was discovered at
Cha Moon-young's karaoke.

201
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,597
Do I need to dye my hair black?

202
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:17,763
Do whatever.

203
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,347
Should I cut it short?

204
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:24,763
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

205
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:26,888
As you were.

206
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:34,055
So, you're Seok-tae.

207
00:22:34,638 --> 00:22:37,722
You seem like a handful.

208
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:39,805
Greet him.

209
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,222
Hello, I'm Bae Seok-tae.

210
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,555
Okay, sit, sit.

211
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:54,597
What are you good at?

212
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:57,305
Well, I.

213
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,222
I'll take him around,
and see what he's good at.

214
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,571
Very well, do it.

215
00:23:04,638 --> 00:23:06,013
I'll do my best, sir.

216
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:07,805
Sure.

217
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:18,071
Do you know Cha Moon-young?

218
00:23:18,138 --> 00:23:19,638
She lived with your brother.

219
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,263
Do you know?

220
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,222
Do you know Cha Moon-young?

221
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:28,821
I heard you were
recently released,

222
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:29,888
were you in Chungju Pen?

223
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:33,680
Yes, why?

224
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:37,155
We understand what
you're going through,

225
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:40,847
and we can only wrap it up
with your cooperation.

226
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,680
Yes, of course.

227
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:46,722
I'm asking just in case,

228
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:50,763
you're not thinking of
doing something in retribution?

229
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,763
From what I hear,
you've caused problem in the past.

230
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,347
If you're done with questions,
I'll be out of your way.

231
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:23,763
Byung-gyu.

232
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:25,780
Yes, sir?

233
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:27,305
Work with me for a few days.

234
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:31,888
I'm really sorry.

235
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,472
If the boss finds out,
he won't be too happy.

236
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:40,055
Things aren't
what they used to be.

237
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:43,513
Why?

238
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,530
He told you to shun me?

239
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:48,847
No, it's not like that.

240
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:58,722
Is this Chang-mo's joint too?

241
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:01,097
Yes.

242
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:03,347
Is he taking good care of you?

243
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,347
All right.

244
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,722
Sir.

245
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,680

248
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,638
What's with you?

249
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:45,013
No means no.

250
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:50,180
Come on.

251
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,013
Do you take me for a fool
because I played nice?

252
00:25:58,763 --> 00:25:59,847
Young-seob.

253
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,571
This is where it happened?

254
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:39,888
The main event happened here.

255
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:41,513
And then.

256
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,821
Some blood was spilled

257
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:45,388
while moving the body.

258
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,555
Was this premeditated
or a spur of the moment?

259
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:51,280
It's too clean to be

260
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:53,638
a spur of the moment,

261
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,597
but too clumsy to be

262
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:57,972
premeditated.

263
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:00,488
What the hell are you saying?

264
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,222
I'm not sure yet.

265
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,763
Why are you here?

266
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,571
Sir, while digging into
Cha's financial records

267
00:28:13,638 --> 00:28:15,405
I found out that her account

268
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,613
was emptied after Bae's death.

269
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,196
You sure?

270
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:20,847
There's not a penny left.

271
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,030
Security cam?

272
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:24,405
It's been smashed.

273
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:27,763
Someone went nuts on it,
it can't be restored.

274
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,222
And

275
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:35,530
Det. Min will replace me
from here on.

276
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:37,738
Why'd narcos get involved in this?

277
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,555
The chief wanted us
to cooperate with narcos.

278
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,113
There's a ton of pressure
from above

279
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,113
to take care of this.

280
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,321
What about Cha's
last known contact?

281
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:52,363
I filled in Det. Min with that.

282
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,780
- Det. Min?
- Yes?

283
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:54,887
What's going on with that?

284
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:00,446
'Sound of his footsteps
in the distance feels like, '

285
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,888
'Getting needle
poked all over my body.'

286
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,905
'Narrowing distance between him'

287
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,680
'Means torturous moments
with him are near.'

288
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,613
'Like a revolving door of
ruthless jerks, '

289
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,030
'They are always within my reach,
gnawing my life away.'

00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:57,905
We checked her call logs,

297
00:29:57,972 --> 00:30:01,555
and you were
the last person she called.

298
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:04,071
I haven't spoken to her recently.

299
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:07,113
Yes, the call never connected,

300
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,180
she called but you didn't pick up.

301
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,530
What do you want to hear from me?

302
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:20,530
We're here because
her live-in boyfriend is dead,

303
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:21,972
and she's not reachable.

304
00:30:22,638 --> 00:30:24,613
We were wondering
if you contacted her

305
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
or met her recently.

306
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:34,196
No, not since last year.

What is your relation to her?

309
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:46,180
We met at the cultural center.

310
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,513
She attended a few of my lectures.

311
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:55,763
And then?

312
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:58,347
What?

313
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:03,972
She attended a few lectures,
anything else afterwards?

314
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:09,613
Do I need to disclose
all my private events?

315
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,138
No, you don't need to
tell me everything.

316
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:18,946

339
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:04,555
I have those thoughts
as I stare at his face.

340
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,722
'I wish his eyes
were shut for good, '

341
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:12,847

343
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:19,946
but he found me in the end.

344
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:21,305
That's when I thought,

345
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:25,972
'I can only escape
from here once he's dead, '

346
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,763

would kill him.'

370
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,472

371

I'm sorry.

376
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:54,513
My friend lives here,
but I couldn't reach her.

How do you know Moon-young?

378
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:09,113
Well, we got to know
each other somehow...

Why are you here?

384
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,097
I, uh.

385
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,722
Sorry for the intrusion.

386
00:39:31,222 --> 00:39:32,555
Are you kidding me?

387
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,780
You were searching
her things earlier!

388
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:37,013
Why did you?

389
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,347
Hey! Stop!

390
00:39:41,888 --> 00:39:44,446
If I asked you a question,
at least answer me!

391
00:39:44,513 --> 00:39:46,488
What. What are you doing?

392
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,180

Why did you enter her home?

396
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,180
She wasn't reachable,

397
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,888
so I was worried.

398
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,113
Even so, you know better,

399

how could you trespass?

400
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:27,180
By the way, that novel you wrote,

401
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:29,030

402
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:31,405
Is that the right title, Det. Min?

- Yes?
- Talk about that book.

and Cha Moon-young.

406

Drug addict husband dies
and the wife disappears.

408
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:02,113
These are quite similar
to our current case,

409
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,530
so we were wondering

410
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,013
if you did not tell us anything.

411

412
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:11,405
that's utter nonsense,

413

you should do so.

419

the story goes in the book?

420

00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,513
Sit wherever you like.

553
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:31,013
What can I get you?

554
00:54:32,847 --> 00:54:34,805
Ma'am, do you know Cha Moon-young?

555
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:39,388
I'm not sure.

556
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:43,138
You got the wrong place.

557
00:54:53,597 --> 00:54:54,946
Could I get some dumplings?

558
00:54:55,013 --> 00:54:56,055
Sure.

559

Dammit.

562
00:58:00,138 --> 00:58:01,388
Honey.

563
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:14,680
Ma'am, where is she?

564
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:19,680
She'll be happy
if you just let her be!

565
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:28,430
She said she's meeting a friend...

566
00:58:40,055 --> 00:58:41,613
How did it go?

567
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,680
Let's head back.

568
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:44,888
Sure.

(Oslo Karaoke)

(Nocturnal Interview 1)

571
00:59:33,972 --> 00:59:37,013
Even now,
when he's high with drugs,

572
00:59:37,347 --> 00:59:40,013
I think about choking him.

573
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:42,472
With him gone,

574
00:59:42,972 --> 00:59:46,097
I could probably go back to
my hometown with Su-min.

575
00:59:48,388 --> 00:59:52,722
I know I shouldn't,
but there's no other way.

576
00:59:54,763 --> 00:59:56,555
Not a single person will help.

577
01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:26,363
In the novel, she leaves Korea.

578
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,972
If she didn't leave,
where would she be?

579
01:00:30,513 --> 01:00:32,946
Someone asked a similar question.

580
01:00:33,013 --> 01:00:34,113
Yes.

581
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,613
If she could go back in time,

582
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,613
when would that be?

583
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,305
I understand, boss.

584
01:00:43,013 --> 01:00:47,972
The answer was,
'Before she ever met him.'

585
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,888
Let's go to Haenam.

586
01:00:53,555 --> 01:00:54,555
Haenam?

587
01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:57,347
Yeah, Haenam.

588
01:00:58,513 --> 01:00:59,680
Let's go.

589
01:01:01,597 --> 01:01:02,597
Sure thing.

590
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,222
Evening, sir.

591
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:20,280
What are you doing here?

592
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,180
He has a brother
named Bae Min-tae,

593
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,113
if something happens to Seok-tae,

594
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,347
he won't stay put.

595
01:01:27,847 --> 01:01:30,263
That man will
kill for his brother.

596
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:33,013
So, what then?

597
01:01:36,513 --> 01:01:39,222
Please track locations for
Kang Ho-ryung and Bae Min-tae.

598
01:01:40,138 --> 01:01:42,263
Then we may be able to
find Cha Moon-young.

599
01:02:35,555 --> 01:02:36,555
Sir.

600
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:41,930
If Moon-young killed him,
what will you do?

601
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,555
I'll send her to
where Seok-tae is.

602
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:14,280
Should I come with you?

603
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:15,847
Stay put here.

(Lovers' Coffee Shop)

605
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:28,222
Welcome.

606
01:03:43,763 --> 01:03:44,972
What's up?

607
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:48,763
He doesn't look like a local.

608
01:04:05,347 --> 01:04:06,555
Could you take my order?

609
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:22,513
What can I get you?

610
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,597
I don't see Moon-young around.

611
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,055
Who?

612
01:04:32,388 --> 01:04:33,680
Give me a Sprite.

613
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:41,513
Ma'am, do you know him?

614
01:04:49,305 --> 01:04:52,013
Look at you, sitting all pretty.

615
01:04:54,347 --> 01:04:59,055
Why are you kicking up dust
and poking around?

616
01:05:04,055 --> 01:05:05,055
Geez...

617
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:08,763
You laugh?

618
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,430
Do you not hear me?

619
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:20,513
Where are you from?

620
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:24,888
Seoul?

621
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,097
Walk away.

622
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:32,097
If someone talks to you,
be a little courteous.

623
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,655
Prick.

624
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,430
What the hell did you say?

625
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,263
You son of a gun!

626
01:05:48,555 --> 01:05:49,555

627
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,430
Stay back, jerk.

Sprite, please?

629
01:07:16,888 --> 01:07:19,805
What in the world is going on?

630
01:07:23,722 --> 01:07:26,180
Ma'am, another Sprite, please!

(Moon-young,
that man came to the shop)

632
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:49,347
What brings you here?

633
01:07:50,097 --> 01:07:51,597
To the farthest end
of the country.

634
01:07:52,972 --> 01:07:54,305
You're a busy man.

635
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:02,597
To meet Moon-young?

636
01:08:08,513 --> 01:08:10,055
All right, don't talk.

637
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:15,513
In your book,
she killed my brother.

638
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:18,347
What was the reason?
Why did she kill him?

639
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:22,680
Are you really oblivious,

640
01:08:23,555 --> 01:08:25,388
or just pretending to be?

641
01:08:26,097 --> 01:08:28,347
Damn, how would I know?

642
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,680
You know better.

643
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:39,013
You know
what your brother was like

644
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,305
and how he lived.

645
01:08:45,263 --> 01:08:46,888
That's why she wanted him dead?

646
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,722
So hungry.

647
01:08:52,763 --> 01:08:55,446
Since Moon-young's back,

648
01:08:55,513 --> 01:08:56,680
should we have a feast?

649
01:08:57,597 --> 01:09:00,347
What are you saying?
Go mop the floor.

650
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:02,305
Why?

651
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:24,222
Where's Moon-young?

652
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:31,930
She's at home, my home.

654
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,722
Where's your boss' home?

655
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:29,555
Where is it?

656
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:33,722
Upstairs.

657
01:10:40,347 --> 01:10:41,680
Yes, boss.

658
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:44,013
I think we found her.

659
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,680
Sir.

660
01:10:53,055 --> 01:10:54,513
We may have found her.

661
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,138

662
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:06,488
Madame, what brings you here?

663
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:08,847
I didn't order coffee.

664
01:11:17,763 --> 01:11:19,763
Mister, who are you?

665
01:11:23,305 --> 01:11:24,722
Wrong house, I guess.

666
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:30,138
Is this your home?

667
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:36,972
It is indeed, can I help you?

668
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:39,597
Freaking hell.

669
01:11:46,472 --> 01:11:47,905
(I'm heading to the terminal, )

670
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:49,305
(I'll call you from there)

671
01:12:21,013 --> 01:12:21,905
Turn the car around!

672
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:23,405
- What?
- Turn it around!

673
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,196
What is it? Who was that?

674
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:25,263
That writer jerk.

675
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,513
Jerk.

676
01:12:43,555 --> 01:12:45,347
What the...

677
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,847
Come on.

678
01:12:53,222 --> 01:12:54,555
What should I do, sir?

679
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,863
Could you open the door?

680
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:02,280
I'm not mad, let's talk.

681
01:13:02,347 --> 01:13:04,347
Open the door!

682
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:06,071
Let me cut your throat open,

683
01:13:06,138 --> 01:13:09,013
so open up!

684
01:13:09,513 --> 01:13:11,263
You damn prick!

685
01:13:14,722 --> 01:13:16,722
Open! Open up!

686
01:13:17,347 --> 01:13:18,847
Son of a gun!

687
01:13:19,222 --> 01:13:20,805
Let him go!

688

689
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,738
So, you think
you killed Oh Ha-sung,

690
01:14:23,805 --> 01:14:25,347
the son of D.K. Corp's CEO?

691
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,180
Yes.

692
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,347
Goddamn, Seok-tae,

693
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:35,722
we're so doomed.

694
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:38,638
Is he really dead?

695
01:14:43,722 --> 01:14:46,513
I told you not to give him drugs.

696
01:14:46,888 --> 01:14:51,680
Didn't I say if his dad finds out,
we are all freaking dead!

697
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,430
So, why did you kill him?

698
01:15:02,305 --> 01:15:04,763
I'm not sure if he's dead.

699
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:07,097
Damn jerk!

700
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:10,680
You just said he's dead!

701
01:15:16,972 --> 01:15:22,847
That jerk wanted Moon-young.

702
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:26,263
What?

703
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:31,430
Dammit.

704
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:39,680
(Mr. Han - D.K.)

705
01:15:48,055 --> 01:15:49,180
Yes?

706
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:55,097
Yes.

707
01:16:04,847 --> 01:16:06,305
I understand.

708
01:16:08,222 --> 01:16:09,263
Yes.

709
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:48,055
Moon-young.

710
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:08,805
Never mind.

711
01:17:39,597 --> 01:17:44,097
Have you met anyone
on the way here?

712
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:30,513
Let go.

713
01:19:10,222 --> 01:19:11,555
Close up the shop.

714
01:19:15,055 --> 01:19:18,430
Did you hear me? Close up!

715
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:37,680
Moon-young.

716
01:19:40,013 --> 01:19:41,180
What do you want to do?

717
01:19:43,013 --> 01:19:49,055
Do you want to end
your miserable life here?

718
01:19:50,722 --> 01:19:53,013
Or go away and live under a rock?

719
01:19:57,013 --> 01:19:58,597
Listen carefully.

720
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,680
If you get caught by
the police or Min-tae,

721
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:09,555
you are as good as dead.

722
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:15,013
Your daughter as well.

723
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:19,847
Understand?

724
01:21:21,513 --> 01:21:22,763
Byung-gyu.

725
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:28,347
It's Chang-mo.

726
01:21:31,138 --> 01:21:32,138
Yes.

727
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,513
I understand, boss.

728
01:21:55,722 --> 01:22:03,222
The Haenam Express bound for Seou
is about to depart soon.

729
01:22:58,847 --> 01:23:01,013
There he is! It's that prick!

730
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:32,138
Moon-young!

731
01:23:44,847 --> 01:23:46,222
Byung-gyu!

732
01:24:07,638 --> 01:24:08,638
Byung-gyu!

733
01:24:10,222 --> 01:24:11,263
Hey!

734
01:24:12,097 --> 01:24:13,138
Get out, prick!

735
01:25:39,013 --> 01:25:40,571
Don't.

736
01:25:40,638 --> 01:25:42,180
Don't follow me, prick!

737
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,722
Stay away! Creep!

738
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:00,930
Dammit.

739
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,388
Get out of there.

740
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,013
Get out!

741
01:26:40,013 --> 01:26:41,863
- Byung-gyu...
- Sir...

742
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:45,847
Why did you do it, tell me!

743
01:26:46,305 --> 01:26:47,555
Why?

744
01:26:49,847 --> 01:26:52,472
I'm sorry, sir...

745
01:26:54,722 --> 01:26:56,155
I'm so sorry.

746
01:26:56,222 --> 01:26:57,930
Did Chang-mo order you?

747
01:27:00,513 --> 01:27:02,055
I'm sorry.

748
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:06,472
I'm so sorry.

749
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,097
Why did you do it?

750
01:27:55,097 --> 01:27:57,513
Just send out an APB!

751
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:13,113
A tomorrow I've never seen

752
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:17,055
It felt like I had everything

753
01:29:18,055 --> 01:29:22,805
Living as an adult in this world

754
01:29:23,597 --> 01:29:28,071
When it sometimes feels too hard

755
01:29:28,138 --> 01:29:31,680
I call out to you

756
01:29:33,013 --> 01:29:35,388
As a friend.

757
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:06,555
Sir, does the drink taste good?

758
01:31:07,263 --> 01:31:09,263
Would you like some more?

759
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:15,930
Where's Chang-mo?

760
01:31:18,847 --> 01:31:23,013
Finish up and head back quietly.

761
01:32:12,013 --> 01:32:13,013
You prick!

762
01:34:20,555 --> 01:34:23,180
So damn tired.

763
01:34:36,347 --> 01:34:37,972
What brings you here?

764
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:41,805
I came to see you.

765
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:49,138
You didn't need to come
so far to see my ugly face.

766
01:34:51,263 --> 01:34:52,472
Indeed.

767
01:34:57,097 --> 01:34:58,097
Boss.

768
01:34:58,972 --> 01:35:00,805
Where are Seok-tae's legs?

769
01:35:12,847 --> 01:35:15,597
You saw his face,
isn't that enough?

770
01:36:04,555 --> 01:36:06,430
(Mr. Han - D.K.)

771
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,680
(Ha Jung-woo)

772
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,722
(Kim Nam-gil)

773
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:28,722
(Yoo Da-in)
