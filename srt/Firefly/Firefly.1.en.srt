1
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,041
Mr. Alvaro.

2
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,125
Tonton.

3
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,833
Sorry?

4
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,500
It's Tonton.

5
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,291
Did you write this?

6
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,583
It's just Tonton.

7
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,375
Mr. Alvaro,

8
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:13,458
I'm here because my editor told me that
you have a confession to make.

9
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,416
You didn't write the story that won
the National Children's Book Prize.

10
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,666
I wrote it.

11
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,083
Those are my drawings too.

12
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,625
So, this is rightfully yours?

13
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,916
Honestly,

14
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,958
I never thought I'd see my face up there.

15
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,791
So, why fireflies?

16
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,791
If you wrote it,

17
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,791
then what was the inspiration behind it?

18
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:58,708
There weren't any fireflies
where I grew up.

19
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,791
When I was young,

20
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,083
I really wanted to see them.

21
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,916
Why?

22
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,833
Someone told me you can make any wish

23
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,000
when you see the light of a firefly.

24
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,500
Who told you that?

25
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,625
The one who first told me this story.

26
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,625
So, you admit it?

27
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,208
It's not an original story, then?

28
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,541
That's not what I mean.

29
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:38,833
Mr. Alvaro, there's a reason
why you agreed to be interviewed.

30
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,625
You said that you want everyone
to know the truth.

31
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,708
So tell me,

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,708
from whom did you steal this story?

33
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,125
Which one do you want?

34
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,333
-Which one?
-This one.

35
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,541
Hold on.

36
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,291
Hey, Tonton!

37
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
Where's your money?

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,541
You can do this, Tonton.

39
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,458
Thanks, Miss Norma!

40
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,583
Hey!

41
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:42,958
Run after him!

42
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,791
Move!

43
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:49,625
Hurry up! Faster!

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,458
-Goodness.
-Let's go, sir!

45
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:04,583
You again, Tonton?

46
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,375
We'll get you!

47
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,791
Watch out!

48
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,125
We'll get you, Tonton!

49
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,791
We'll get you!

50
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,166
You're dead!

51
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,750
We'll get you!

52
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,041
Watch out!

53
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,375
You're dead!

54
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,833
You're dead!

55
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,791
Stop here, sir!

56
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:39,500
Let's go.

57
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,083
-Ouch!
-Sorry!

58
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,250
Oh!

59
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,125
Ma!

60
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
Ma!

61
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,166
Look!

62
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,458
Look at that!

63
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,833
What a coward!

64
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,333
-Tonton!
-Ma…

65
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,083
Shoo! Scram!

66
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,166
Tonton?

67
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,458
-Ma. Ma.
-Tonton? Tonton! Dear.

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,875
-Don't be afraid.
-Ma.

69
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,500
Ma!

70
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,208
Ma.

71
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,458
-Come here. Hush.
-Ma.

72
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,958
Hush.

73
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,416
Hey! You kids!

74
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,666
What are you doing?
Go home to your mothers!

75
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,583
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

76
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,208
My timing was good, Auntie Linda.

77
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:29,500
Well, I don't wanna hear it.

78
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,500
Elay, this is your fault.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,750
Why do you allow him to go out on his own?

80
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,666
He just gets into trouble!

81
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,958
Auntie, he can handle it, right?

82
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,125
Don't be mad.

83
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,875
I'll take you to the salon tomorrow.

84
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,166
Goodness.

85
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,208
You can't fool me.

86
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:53,666
You, why do you keep going back there?

87
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,125
You know that's where
the troublemakers hang out.

88
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,916
It's the only place I can get this,
Auntie Linda.

89
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,416
What's that?

90
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,500
Happy birthday, Ma!

91
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,375
-Wow! One for me! My goodness!
-Gosh!

92
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,250
Thank you!

93
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,583
It's squished though.

94
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,583
No! That's my favorite!

95
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:16,958
I only eat the squished ones.

96
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,375
You two! That's what you're good at!

97
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,708
Hold on, Elay.

98
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,666
I have something for you too.

99
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
-Got you!
-No fair!

100
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,625
-Why?
-Wait!

101
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,416
You didn't call a timeout.

102
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,291
Don't you do that in school?

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,041
Ma…

104
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,041
do you think I'll get taller?

105
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,875
Of course.

106
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:10,291
I wish I was bigger like the other kids.

107
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,833
Maybe then I'd be brave.

108
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,958
Hey.

109
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,625
You know, son.

110
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,500
You're brave.

111
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,916
Much braver than you think.

112
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,500
See how you outran them?

113
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,125
That was brilliant!

114
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,833
That was just luck, Ma.

115
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,708
I'm still a coward.

116
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,083
Listen.

117
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,666
Remember,

118
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,916
sometimes the smallest ones
are the toughest.

119
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,333
Just like the story?

120
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,583
Just like the story.

121
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,625
Okay, fine.

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,041
Fine.

123
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:26,666
Once, on an enchanted island
filled with light,

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,666
a creature made a wish.

125
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,333
"I wish I had a friend,"

126
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,041
said the butterfly.

127
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,625
Just then, a firefly

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,333
appeared from a tree.

129
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,458
"Where did you come from?"
asked the butterfly.

130
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,208
"You wished upon the light
of the fireflies, did you not?"

131
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,625
said the firefly.

132
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,833
"From now on, we'll always be together."

133
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,416
One day, a ferocious dog appeared.

134
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,958
It was attracted by the butterfly's wings

135
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
and wanted to take them.

136
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,166
But the firefly wouldn't allow it.

137
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,291
It mustered all the light in its body
to stop the dog.

138
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
The beast was blinded,

139
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,000
and the friends escaped.

140
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,708
But because the firefly had given
all the light it had inside,

141
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,375
it lost its shine,

142
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,583
until it no longer remembered
that it was a firefly.

143
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,375
"Someday," the butterfly said,

144
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,458
"we will return to the island

145
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:57,541
and wish upon a thousand fireflies
so that your light may return."

146
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,416
They say

147
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,916
that if you look around,

148
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,208
you might see them.

149
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They're still searching for the light

150
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:23,208
of the bravest firefly on the island.

151
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:37,083
She'd tell me that story
whenever I got bullied.

152
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,041
Troublemakers always found me.

153
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,250
I found courage in her stories

154
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:48,541
because I knew I didn't have it in me.

155
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:53,666
But why does it feel unfinished?

156
00:12:55,291 --> 00:13:00,583
The first book ended
without them finding the missing light.

157
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,750
That's the beauty of stories.

158
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,666
You can always continue.

159
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:15,750
When I was young, it felt like
my mother's stories were alive.

160
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,166
There was always more to be told,
and they kept evolving.

161
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,000
Ma, how come we don't have fireflies here?

162
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,958
Why?

163
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,583
I want to see one.

164
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,958
You won't find any here.

165
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,833
Ma, are you okay?

166
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,083
Yes.

167
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,583
You've got a better chance
in the countryside.

168
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
That's where you'll find them.

169
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,000
The air is cleaner there.

170
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,958
How do I find them, Ma?

171
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,875
You really want to know?

172
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,250
I'll tell you.

173
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,833
The island is real, Ton.

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,416
How will I get there, Ma?

175
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:16,333
People say the enchanted island
is in Ticao.

176
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,250
In Bicol.

177
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,708
Ticao?

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,583
Let's find it, Ma!

179
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,833
Of course!

180
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,708
You're lucky I still remember the map!

181
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,791
First, you'll see the fairy
with a very long dress

182
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,541
and a white crown touching the sky.

183
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,125
As long as you can see the fairy,

184
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,250
you're heading in the right direction.

185
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,666
After the fairy,

186
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:14,208
you'll pass a sneezing giant.

187
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,750
When it sneezes,

188
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,666
all the rivers fill with water.

189
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,916
Achoo!

190
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,458
Now, the final challenge.

191
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:03,666
You'll need to cross the ocean
to reach the mouth of the stone man.

192
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,583
Stone man?

193
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,208
Stone man.

194
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,583
Roar!

195
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:17,041
From afar, he looks like
a bump in the middle of the sea.

196
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,958
But if you look closely,

197
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,833
you'll see his face.

198
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:30,166
You need to go inside his mouth

199
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,083
to see the light of a thousand fireflies.

200
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,000
Remember, Tonton.

201
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:42,375
When you get there,
your wish will come true.

202
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,541
Do you think I'll make it, Ma?

203
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,375
Wait, do you doubt your own mother?

204
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,458
I promise, when we get there,

205
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,083
we'll be welcomed by bright lights!

206
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,958
You promise?

207
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,375
Promise!

208
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,166
-For real?
-Of course!

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,041
Wait.

210
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,166
-Ma? Can I make a wish there?
-Mm?

211
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,583
Of course.

212
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,375
Mm?

213
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:46,041
Can I wish to be brave?

214
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,041
Is that what you want?

215
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,375
Mm-hmm.

216
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,833
Yes.

217
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:53,916
Okay.

218
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,833
We'll both make a wish. Anything you like.

219
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:57,916
Let me do it.

220
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh?

221
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,166
What a good boy.

222
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,500
Bananacue! Freshly cooked!

223
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,208
Wow! Nice! Very good!

224
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,625
What's this? A butterfly?

225
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,000
How corny!

226
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,208
Don't make fun of my mother's story!

227
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,833
Don't make fun of my mother's story!

228
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,500
Give me that!

229
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,791
-Please! Give it back!
-Baste!

230
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,375
Please! Give it back!

231
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey!

232
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,041
Please! Give it back!

233
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,250
Give it back!

234
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,541
Baste, stop it! That's wrong!

235
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,500
See me later.

236
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,291
Tonton?

237
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,375
Tonton? Dear?

238
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,458
Tonton.

239
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,500
Firefly,

240
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,625
please make me brave.

241
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:02,166
You'll take care of Tonton, right?

242
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,875
I'll show you something.

243
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,083
What is it, Ma?

244
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,875
Close your eyes.

245
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,666
Surprise!

246
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,333
What's that?

247
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,875
It's your stories.

248
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,250
I left the map there

249
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,041
so you won't get lost.

250
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,416
So you can find the island.

251
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,708
We'll find it, Ma!

252
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,083
Of course! We've got each other, right?

253
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,541
Promise you won't lose that.

254
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,000
Promise.

255
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:25,416
I still need to add things to my story.

256
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,000
What things, Ma?

257
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,500
You're good at drawing, right?

258
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,083
I'll try, Ma.

259
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,000
But what happened, Ma?

260
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,625
Huh?

261
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:43,875
What happened after the firefly
and butterfly left the island?

262
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,500
I'll tell you, okay?

263
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,833
I'll write it down.

264
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:50,916
Hmm?

265
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,958
Then you'll draw it?

266
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,333
-There.
-Okay.

267
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,000
I take children!

268
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,416
Who's there?

269
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,500
Ha! They're no match!

270
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,750
Merry Christmas, son!

271
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,833
Thank you, Ma.

272
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,208
-Let's eat!
-Ma.

273
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,833
-Oh?
-I also have something.

274
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,250
Here.

275
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,625
I Love you
Ma

276
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,166
Love you, Ma!

277
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,375
I love you, son!

278
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,750
It's almost done, Ma.

279
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:18,916
You know, Ton,

280
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,625
a person's life

281
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,958
is like a story.

282
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,416
It has a beginning,

283
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,458
joys in between,

284
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,791
and then it ends.

285
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:54,416
Everyone has to say goodbye someday.

286
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,833
Even you, Ma?

287
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,416
Ma, when we get to the island,

288
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll make a wish.

289
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,625
I know. You'll wish to be brave, right?

290
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,583
That's not all.

291
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:18,916
I will wish for us
to never, ever be apart.

292
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,625
I'm sorry, son.
I don't think I can go with you.

293
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,833
Why not, Ma?

294
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,791
Just think of it

295
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:45,625
as I'll be going on ahead.

296
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:50,708
When the time comes, you'll find me there

297
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:54,083
on the island of the fireflies.

298
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,000
No! I want to go with you, Ma!

299
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,416
You can't. You still have to
finish that, right?

300
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:03,666
I don't want to!

301
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:06,958
Son.

302
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,333
Son, listen to me.

303
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:15,750
Do you remember

304
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,625
in the story

305
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,583
how the firefly became brave?

306
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,708
At first, he couldn't fight off the dog

307
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,291
because he was so tiny.

308
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,916
The dog was so fierce.

309
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,291
-He was scared.
-Ma…

310
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,791
But he remembered something.

311
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,208
What did he remember, Ma?

312
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,333
He remembered that he loved the butterfly,

313
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,500
and that gave him courage.

314
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,708
My son,

315
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,500
be brave.

316
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,125
Ma…

317
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,458
When you're in the dark,

318
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,166
look for the fireflies.

319
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,833
You'll find me there.

320
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:18,458
Promise me, okay?

321
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:19,666
Ma…

322
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,208
Please, son.

323
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,250
I promise, Ma.

324
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,416
Promise?

325
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,166
Promise.

326
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:55,666
She prepared me the only way she could.

327
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,583
Can I ask…?

328
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:03,041
Metastatic breast cancer.

329
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:08,083
In the end,

330
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,666
all that was left were her stories.

331
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,500
Why did you cremate Elay, Miss Linda?

332
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,791
Poor thing.

333
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:28,208
Good thing City Hall paid for it.

334
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,083
I had to beg them.

335
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,208
Let it be. It's what Elay wanted.

336
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,458
So she could be brought home to Bicol.

337
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:42,208
Wait, why are you even asking?

338
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,875
Have some respect.

339
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,500
Are you even our relative?

340
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,000
Auntie Linda?

341
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:15,958
Auntie Linda.

342
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,166
-Auntie Linda?
-Oh?

343
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,583
Hey. Come in!

344
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:24,833
Auntie Linda.

345
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:28,000
Are we taking Mama to Bicol?

346
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,666
Um… I don't know yet.

347
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,500
It may take some time.

348
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,541
Wait, hold on. Here.

349
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,500
Here, have some biscuits.

350
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:38,083
-Auntie Linda?
-Yes?

351
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,083
Can't we go to Ticao?

352
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,375
Yes. Hold on, Tonton.

353
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,083
Here. What?

354
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,333
There's some coffee inside
if you'd like some.

355
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,166
-Auntie Linda.
-Ton! Stop it!

356
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm busy!

357
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,833
Let's talk about it some other time, okay?

358
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,458
Not now.

359
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,125
Hello! Welcome…

360
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:17,791
Ma, I need you here.

361
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:23,375
Look for the fireflies, son.

362
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,583
Promise me, okay?

363
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,291
Fireflies.

364
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,750
The island of the fireflies.

365
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,791
I thought

366
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,541
that if only I could find the fireflies,

367
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,375
maybe they could…

368
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,250
I wanted to wish her back.

369
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,041
I'm sure…

370
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,291
I'm sure she's proud of you.

371
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,083
You finished the books
you were drawing together.

372
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:30,250
I wanted to believe
I did everything I promised her.

373
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,166
So, I looked for that island.

374
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:40,041
You mean the firefly and butterfly
in the book?

375
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,791
In the story, they did that, yes.

376
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,000
But that's not what I meant.

377
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,375
What I mean is,

378
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,833
I kept my promise.

379
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,791
I searched for the island.

380
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:37,541
Bicol, Legazpi, Sorsogon.

381
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,125
Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry.

382
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,958
So, I'll get to Bicol in the morning.

383
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,416
I'm just waiting, Ma.

384
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,708
-"Elay"?
-I'm waiting for the bus.

385
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,500
Yes, Ma. Yes, okay.

386
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,125
Sorsogon! Sorsogon!

387
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,416
Ah, it's here. Okay.

388
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:06,708
Bye.

389
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,458
Sorsogon! Sorsogon!

390
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,708
Sorsogon!

391
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,875
Sorsogon, Sorsogon!

392
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,875
Sorsogon!

393
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,666
-Brother!
-Sorsogon!

394
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,916
Brother, can I listen too?

395
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:35,875
Brother!

396
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,500
Sorsogon, Sorsogon!

397
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,875
Sorsogon!

398
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,708
Sorsogon! Sorsogon!

399
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,458
Is anyone with you, kid?

400
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:04,166
My brother.

401
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:22,958
Here, miss. Let me help.

402
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,875
Thank you!

403
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,750
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

404
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,541
Everyone on board? We're leaving!

405
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:25,333
The typhoon is now inside
the Philippine Area of Responsibility

406
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,291
and will make landfall in 24 hours.

407
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,000
Southern parts of the Bicol region
will be affected.

408
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:36,000
Residents in coastal areas
are advised to take caution…

409
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,458
Don't worry.

410
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,833
The skies are clear.

411
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:45,166
The storm won't land
while we're traveling.

412
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,791
We'll get there in less than 24 hours.

413
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,083
You know what?

414
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,791
You remind me of my son.

415
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,666
Hi, Auntie.

416
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,791
Hi.

417
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,791
Sir, do you know where Ticao is?

418
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,250
Ticao?

419
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,625
Yes.

420
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,500
From Sorsogon,

421
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,708
you'll need to ride a ferry to Ticao.

422
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,916
Doesn't your brother know?

423
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,416
Ah, young man? Young man?

424
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,333
Please don't. He's a grouch.

425
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,000
Ah, young man?

426
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,375
-You're awake.
-Huh?

427
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,333
Your brother and I
have been chatting here.

428
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,500
What?

429
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,750
Really?

430
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:38,916
Oh my God!

431
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,333
Wow, Auntie, oh my gosh!

432
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:49,500
Gosh, how I wish I had the time to visit
all the beaches you told me about

433
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,833
but I can't.

434
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,583
I have a tight schedule.

435
00:37:53,666 --> 00:38:00,083
I have charity work, a feeding program,
and a clean-up drive.

436
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:04,375
Then I'll meet with our donors
from Manila.

437
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,291
What's your charity called again?

438
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, Auntie, it's called United Colors

439
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:17,375
of Youth of Charity Foundation, Inc.

440
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,875
Wow! That's long.

441
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:26,916
Thing is, funding's a challenge,

442
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,875
so we're saving our allowance.

443
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,291
Wait.

444
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,291
Oh no, Auntie!

445
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:47,166
-This is too much.
-It's just to help out.

446
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,416
Oh Auntie, thank you so much!

447
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,208
You'll make a lot of kids happy!

448
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,666
Scammer.

449
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,333
Bye, Auntie. Enjoy yourself.

450
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,458
Oh! Are you sure?

451
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,458
Gosh, thank you so much!

452
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,041
You know, someday,
we might see each other again.

453
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,625
I promise I'll repay you.

454
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,791
-Thanks again!
-Sure, no problem.

455
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:09,666
-I'm happy to help a fellow backpacker.
-Yes, thank you! Here's the photo.

456
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,958
Cut it out!

457
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,375
Man,

458
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,833
don't be fooled by that girl.

459
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,500
Mind your own business!

460
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,833
What's your problem?

461
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,625
-I took those…
-My problem is, you're a scammer.

462
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,166
Me? A scammer?

463
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,416
What? Who did I scam?

464
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:34,416
The passengers here.

465
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,041
-Hey?
-You think no one noticed?

466
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,750
-Bro, how much did you give her?
-Hey!

467
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,208
Excuse me, is it my fault I'm friendly?

468
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,541
-I gave them a photo.
-You two should stay away from each other.

469
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,291
You're disturbing the other passengers.

470
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:50,875
-I'm just helping them out.
-This guy is meddling!

471
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,583
-Mind your own business!
-Sister, Brother, please don't fight.

472
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,750
Don't butt in!

473
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,250
-Hey.
-I'm not the problem here.

474
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:00,416
That's no way to treat a little brother!

475
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,375
Who? This kid?

476
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,250
He's been following me since the terminal!

477
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,666
-Hey!
-You're too much!

478
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,250
You know, you're so rude!

479
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,125
You'll fight with anyone.

480
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:13,458
What's happening? You know…

481
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:16,916
Hey! That's mine! I said that's mine!

482
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,250
Ugh! Just my bad luck!

483
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,375
Some people don't know
how to mind their own business!

484
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,583
Oh, you're mad?

485
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:41,250
We were traveling in peace
before you brought us into your modus!

486
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,625
What?

487
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:46,083
Well, you should've kept your mouth shut!

488
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,125
I had to warn them about you.

489
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,458
Hey! Aren't you embarrassed at all?

490
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:55,125
I'm sorry.

491
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,708
But I don't plan on rotting here.

492
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,583
Sister, where are you going?

493
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,333
Can I come with you?

494
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,583
Where are you off to, sister? Sister?

495
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,000
Sister! Can I come?

496
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,833
Sister, can I come with you?

497
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,250
Where are you going?

498
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:28,041
Do you really want to know?

499
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,458
I'm off to the farthest point.

500
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:34,666
Sorsogon.

501
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,583
You're going to Sorsogon?

502
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,625
Why? What do you care?

503
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:43,291
I'm going that way too.

504
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,500
Home to Masbate.

505
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,583
You.

506
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:50,583
Where are you from?

507
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,750
Who are you with?

508
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:57,250
Why are you alone?

509
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:07,416
My mom and I were supposed to go to Bicol

510
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:10,000
to the island of fireflies.

511
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:13,041
But… I got left behind.

512
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:14,666
You were left behind?

513
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,916
Where?

514
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:18,708
At…

515
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,916
at the…

516
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,416
the…

517
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,083
the bus station.

518
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,708
Kid, you should've asked
for help right there

519
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:40,500
instead of pretending you were
the brother of…

520
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,125
It's Billy.

521
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,791
Louie.

522
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:47,833
Erika.

523
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,791
Tonton.

524
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,958
Tonton,

525
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,666
you can't travel alone.

526
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,625
Maybe we should take you back to Manila.

527
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:03,875
My whole family is in Ticao!

528
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,708
Can't you just drop me off there,
Mister Louie?

529
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,791
Why don't we all just find a ride?

530
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,500
What will I do with you, kid?

531
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,541
Ton, are you sure that island exists?

532
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,416
Yes, Erika.

533
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:39,666
I doubt it.

534
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,958
I like that!

535
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,500
You have such a pleasing personality,
you know.

536
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,541
Didn't you say you had a map?

537
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,000
Here.

538
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,416
This is it?

539
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:15,708
First, we'll pass the fairy with a crown.

540
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,125
Magayon.

541
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:41,125
Finally, we meet again.

542
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,625
Magayon?

543
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,041
Look at those clouds!

544
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,250
Tonton, can I see your map?

545
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,458
Fairy?

546
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,708
Crown?

547
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:33,833
Crown!

548
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:35,291
A crown?

549
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,000
Look, Tonton!

550
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,875
The fairy with a crown!

551
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,583
Ma, I found the fairy.

552
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:13,750
Mister Louie, aren't you from Albay?
Whereabouts?

553
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,458
Around.

554
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,291
Why do you ask?

555
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:23,833
Do you know where we can ask for help?

556
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:26,666
Let's take this kid to the village captain
or to the police.

557
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,583
We might get in trouble.

558
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,416
Police?

559
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,708
Gosh!

560
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,250
So many angles.

561
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,166
I'm running out of film.

562
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,125
Wait, where's Tonton?

563
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,041
He was just here a while ago.

564
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,083
-Ton?
-Tonton?

565
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:52,916
Tonton!

566
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:03,541
Tonton?

567
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:04,916
Tonton!

568
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:10,916
Ton?

569
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,708
Tonton, stop! Tonton!

570
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,916
Tonton! Hey!

571
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,083
Tonton!

572
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,500
-Hey!
-Tonton!

573
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,833
Hey!

574
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,541
Are you okay?

575
00:49:43,625 --> 00:49:45,000
Are you blind?

576
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,666
You almost ran over him!

577
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:52,708
Are you all right?

578
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,666
God, this kid!

579
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:57,041
Hey!

580
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,375
That's mine.

581
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,666
Mister Louie?

582
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,166
I wanted to go to Saudi.

583
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,166
Mister Louie,

584
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,041
what's in Saudi?

585
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,958
A chance at a better life.

586
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,833
The placement fee was 80,000,

587
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:51,291
so the agency could fix my papers.

588
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:55,958
They told me to look for others,
to recruit people,

589
00:50:56,416 --> 00:51:00,500
or they wouldn't process my application.

590
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:03,416
I was asked to collect everyone's fees

591
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:06,791
so I was the one that got sued.

592
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,416
"Illegal recruiter."

593
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:14,375
My son, Romnick,

594
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:17,250
had to stop school.

595
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:22,041
I don't know what I'll come home to.

596
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:27,166
Mister Louie, you're not a bad person.

597
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,208
Mister Louie, your house isn't
that far from here, is it?

598
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:37,291
Why not just go?

599
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,125
I'm not sure.

600
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,875
Mister Louie, let's go.

601
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,083
Will they take me back?

602
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:25,625
Let's go, Mister Louie.

603
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:27,916
Hello!

604
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,791
Hello!

605
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,333
-Hello!
-Hello!

606
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,833
-Hello!
-Hello!

607
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:39,791
Is anyone home?

608
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,416
Hello!

609
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,625
My sweetheart! My love.

610
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,500
Why didn't you tell us?

611
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:39,458
Romnick!

612
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,083
Hurry!

613
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:57,958
Pa?

614
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,000
Pa, what took you so long?

615
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,958
I've been waiting for you.

616
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,041
I'm here now.

617
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,291
I'm finally with you.

618
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:51,958
Who are they?

619
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:00,916
Carmen?

620
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,208
What should I do?

621
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,583
What if they say

622
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,291
that I kidnapped the kid?

623
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:10,583
What are my chances?

624
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,833
Louie,

625
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,750
you're a good person.

626
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:21,000
Look at those strays
you brought here to feed.

627
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:23,541
You know,

628
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:27,541
Miss Carmen seems like the type of mom

629
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,333
who'll forgive you no matter what.

630
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,208
Not all mothers are like that.

631
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,625
My wife's cooking!

632
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,416
It looks so good.

633
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:51,833
Ton, I bet you have a good mom.

634
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,458
Because you really wanna
go home to her, right?

635
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:59,750
She's the best mom in the whole world!

636
00:56:01,083 --> 00:56:02,333
That's nice.

637
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,625
You know,

638
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,416
I'm not a bad person either.

639
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:13,708
I just do what I need to do.

640
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:18,208
And actually, I'm very nice!

641
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,083
From the beginning, goodness!

642
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,541
I never had a doubt, right?

643
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:30,416
See? I figured out Mayon was the fairy.

644
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:32,291
Uh-huh.

645
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,333
Are you talking about Magayon?

646
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:36,916
Yes.

647
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,208
Come on! Let's eat!

648
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,625
The food is good. Come, boy!

649
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:49,333
Let's eat!

650
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:58,208
Come here!

651
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,666
Try my wife's cooking.

652
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,416
If Magayon is the fairy,

653
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,333
then it should be big too.

654
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:13,666
Like a giant.

655
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,791
A sleeping giant.

656
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:22,541
So, something big that's lying down.

657
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,625
What else did she say?

658
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,625
It likes to sneeze.

659
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,791
Sneeze?

660
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:36,000
Hmm. That's a monkey.

661
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:37,458
Lots of forests here.

662
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,083
So, you tell jokes now, huh?

663
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,416
Why? It's true. It could be a monkey.

664
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:48,166
A sneezing giant

665
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,791
who likes to sleep?

666
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,708
I've got it!

667
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,291
Do you think this is it?

668
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,291
Hang on, wait.

669
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,416
Where was this taken?

670
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,333
Oh, I know!

671
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,541
Tonton, we're here!

672
00:58:28,458 --> 00:58:30,541
The sleeping giant!

673
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:37,666
Erika!

674
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:41,333
Oh!

675
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:42,833
It's beautiful!

676
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,291
Tonton, don't stick your hand out.

677
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,041
Wow!

678
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:22,458
I knew you'd be the one
to take me to the island, Billy.

679
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,750
My mom's name is Elay too.

680
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,750
It's Melay, not Elay.

681
00:59:38,166 --> 00:59:40,583
Melay or Elay, same thing.

682
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,125
It's a good sign to him.

683
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,875
How is it a good sign?

684
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,000
I regret ever putting it on my arm.

685
00:59:57,333 --> 01:00:01,375
It's a reminder that
I shouldn't trust so easily.

686
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,666
Just because you made a promise
to each other

687
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,833
doesn't mean someone won't fool you.

688
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:14,166
She even took my college savings.

689
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:17,583
How can you say that's a good sign?

690
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:23,291
Brother, I believe my mother sent you

691
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,666
so I'd have a friend
to take me to the island.

692
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:28,958
Not everything you believe is true.

693
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,791
We're not even friends.
We just ran into you.

694
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,041
We'll part ways eventually, you'll see.

695
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:25,416
Manila police?

696
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,208
Shall we go?

697
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,250
Hey!

698
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,916
Hey! Billy, be careful!

699
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:51,666
Hold on, okay?

700
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,375
Louie.

701
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:01,333
If Magayon is the fairy

702
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:05,000
and Bulusan is the giant,

703
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:07,541
could there really be
an island of fireflies?

704
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:09,000
What do you think?

705
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:14,083
I don't know, darling.

706
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:17,125
All I want

707
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,291
is to make it to Ticao safely.

708
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,791
We'll drop the boy off.

709
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,750
Just let the cops pass us.

710
01:02:47,958 --> 01:02:51,875
You know, Tonton, when we see your mother,

711
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,708
I want to ask her something.

712
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,500
Mister Louie?

713
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,333
I need to tell you something.

714
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,000
Feeling grouchy again?

715
01:03:48,583 --> 01:03:49,666
No.

716
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,708
You were mean to Tonton earlier.

717
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:00,666
It wasn't on purpose.

718
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:06,625
We shouldn't feel so down.

719
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:09,916
Look at this!

720
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:16,041
Look into my eyes

721
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:19,750
Can't you see?

722
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:23,583
What?

723
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,291
Me?

724
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:37,166
I'm flying up in the clouds

725
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,750
Come with me

726
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,541
Brother? Time to go.

727
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:36,958
Help!

728
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,125
-Billy! Billy!
-Help!

729
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:40,458
Tonton!

730
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,541
Hey!

731
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,583
-Billy! What happened?
-Billy!

732
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,875
Louie!

733
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,375
-Tonton! Ton, no!
-My notebook!

734
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,083
Billy!

735
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,583
Don't, you might fall!

736
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,000
Sorry.

737
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,500
I'm sorry, Ton.

738
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:19,375
Ton, I'm sorry. You said
I'd take you to the island, right?

739
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,208
It's true. I was just kidding earlier.

740
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,541
Tonton. Hey.

741
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:24,791
Hey… I'm sorry.

742
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,958
We'll find the island
of the fireflies. Okay?

743
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,583
I promise.

744
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:31,666
Don't be sad.

745
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:36,541
My notebook.

746
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,416
The ferry's leaving!

747
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,208
It's leaving!

748
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,208
Run after it!

749
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:56,791
-Hurry up!
-Hurry!

750
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:59,416
-I'll go ahead.
-Yes, go.

751
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:05,000
-Wait, please!
-Tonton! Hurry!

752
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,708
-Wait!
-Please wait!

753
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:08,666
-Wait for us!
-Wait!

754
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,791
-Wait for us!
-Hey!

755
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,000
Sir, what time is the next trip?

756
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,583
No more trips today, sir.

757
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:23,083
The next one's tomorrow morning.

758
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,750
What do we do now, Louie?

759
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,666
The next ferry to Ticao leaves tomorrow.

760
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,833
Tonton?

761
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,833
Ton?

762
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,041
Thief!

763
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:46,208
Guard!

764
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:48,041
Come back here!

765
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:51,041
-Come here! Give me that!
-Ma!

766
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,041
-Come here! Guard! Guard!
-Ma!

767
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,750
Ma.

768
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,875
Ma.

769
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,125
Ma.

770
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:04,708
Ma, sorry!

771
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,625
Ma.

772
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,666
Ma.

773
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,708
Ma…

774
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:14,000
Ma.

775
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:17,416
Ma.

776
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,375
Tonton, why didn't you tell us?

777
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:26,125
If I'd told you, would you have helped me?

778
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:29,875
Or would you have told on me?

779
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:32,291
Ma.

780
01:08:35,583 --> 01:08:37,250
Ma…

781
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:50,083
I made a promise to my mother

782
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,708
to find the fireflies.

783
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:59,375
That's why I need to get to the island.

784
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,291
It's real!

785
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:07,166
-But…
-You believe me, right?

786
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,666
Tonton,

787
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,791
we need to let your family know.

788
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,500
Where are they?

789
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,166
My great aunt Linda is in Manila.

790
01:09:22,666 --> 01:09:26,375
But please don't take me back there yet.

791
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:30,041
She won't allow it.

792
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:31,333
Please?

793
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:35,541
I promise I'll go home after.

794
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,750
We're almost there.

795
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:41,916
Ma.

796
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:43,916
Ma…

797
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,666
Ma…

798
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,791
Ma…

799
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,708
Ma…

800
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:58,791
Erika,

801
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,583
Miss Carmen,

802
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:10,083
Mister Louie,

803
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,416
Billy.

804
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,958
Ma…

805
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:30,000
Ma…

806
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:33,541
Ma…

807
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:34,750
The end.

808
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,166
No.

809
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,416
That can't be.

810
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:42,208
Why not? That's what happened.

811
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:44,833
I dropped the box. I got caught.

812
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:46,916
End of story.

813
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,166
I don't believe you.

814
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,875
I know there's more to it.

815
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:54,583
Okay.

816
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,375
If you think you're right,

817
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:02,500
what happens next?

818
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,125
I think

819
01:11:09,541 --> 01:11:11,125
you kept going.

820
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,708
I don't know why they still went with me.

821
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:24,333
Truth is, it could have ended there.

822
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:31,666
But when we were on that ferry,
I felt hope again

823
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,625
that I would see that island.

824
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,291
Be careful.

825
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:00,375
Thank you!

826
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,500
Wow.

827
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:04,791
Tonton.

828
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:06,541
We're here.

829
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,708
Is this Ticao?

830
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,291
Yes. Come on.

831
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:12,958
Let's look for the island of fireflies.

832
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,375
Let's go.

833
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,625
Let's see.

834
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,333
I'll ask around over there.

835
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,416
-You can look here.
-All right, Mister Louie.

836
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,666
See you later.

837
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,500
Ma'am.

838
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:40,083
Is there an island of fireflies
around here?

839
01:12:40,166 --> 01:12:41,791
-Fireflies?
-Yes.

840
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,333
Is that a resort?

841
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:47,291
How about a stone island? Dark island?

842
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:48,666
Anything like that?

843
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,750
-I'll try that way.
-All right.

844
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,458
Is there a stone island,

845
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,500
or a hill of stone,

846
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,583
or a stone man around here?

847
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:17,041
Sir, you're kidding, right?

848
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,041
-Can I borrow this?
-Sure.

849
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,750
Tonton, look here!

850
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:38,000
Are you sure
there isn't a trip to that island?

851
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,541
Sorry, there isn't.

852
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,708
Sorry to cut the line.

853
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,666
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

854
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,291
Are you sure?

855
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,791
I'm sure. Sorry.

856
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,125
Excuse me.

857
01:13:57,208 --> 01:14:02,125
Miss, have you seen a kid walking around?

858
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:05,041
He looks like this.
Small and fair-skinned.

859
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:11,291
They're not selling any boat tickets
to the island Tonton described.

860
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:13,208
Mister Louie, look.

861
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:15,583
-Huh?
-Look at this.

862
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:17,833
But you can't buy tickets to that island.

863
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:19,375
I talked to the boatmen.

864
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:23,208
They know this island,
but fuel's gonna cost us.

865
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,125
We don't have enough, Louie.

866
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,750
What do we do now?

867
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,791
Announcement.

868
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,375
There is a missing child.
Please report if seen.

869
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:41,666
-Sir, have you seen this boy?
-Announcement…

870
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,166
-No, ma'am sorry.
-Are you sure?

871
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,458
No, ma'am.

872
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,791
That was tiring. No one here knows
about the island of fireflies.

873
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,208
It's here! Check this out.

874
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,916
We just don't have money for the boat.

875
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,916
-Have you seen this boy?
-No.

876
01:15:18,708 --> 01:15:21,583
Erika, isn't this your savings?

877
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:24,666
So you don't need to go back home?

878
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:29,750
Well, guess I'll go home if I have to.

879
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:36,541
Besides, I told them
I'd use the money to help kids, right?

880
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:40,791
Well, aren't you a kid?

881
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,583
You'll get there.

882
01:15:54,166 --> 01:16:00,833
There is a missing child.
Please report if seen.

883
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:02,750
There is a missing child.

884
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:11,208
There is a missing child.
Please report if seen.

885
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:15,500
Tonton.

886
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:18,958
Come here.

887
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,833
Go on.

888
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,833
Tonton.

889
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:32,583
Are you the missing kid
they're looking for?

890
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:46,625
My great aunt won't take me to the island.

891
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That's your great aunt?

892
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:59,041
No one's gonna believe
that I didn't take you.

893
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,875
I might end up in jail again.

894
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:04,875
Who's gonna believe
we just met you on the road

895
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:08,375
and wanted to help you find the island?

896
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,125
Tonton,

897
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:15,083
we have nowhere else to go.

898
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:19,291
Mister Louie.

899
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,541
What's that look?

900
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:40,541
It can't be the end.

901
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Can't.

902
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,708
Why not?

903
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,166
Because!

904
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,083
I refuse to believe that after everything,

905
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,958
that's how it ends?

906
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:54,500
When you were so close?

907
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:56,791
Auntie Linda was smart.

908
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:01,375
She knew where I wanted to go.

909
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,875
So, she found me.

910
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,416
The end.

911
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,833
I promised him I'd take him to the island.

912
01:18:40,666 --> 01:18:42,125
And I told him…

913
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:47,500
I'd take him to his mother.

914
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:58,083
We're just doing what's best for him.

915
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:26,208
Are you all right?

916
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:28,041
Yes.

917
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:34,875
Thank you, Miss Carmen.

918
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:36,791
Thank you, Mister Louie.

919
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:39,625
Thank you, Billy.

920
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:42,375
Thanks too, Erika.

921
01:19:44,125 --> 01:19:48,291
Ton, just promise you'll visit us in jail?

922
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:52,833
Hey. This is our last trip, okay?

923
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:58,958
Then we'll take you back
to your great aunt.

924
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,208
Yes.

925
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:04,750
Don't worry, Ton.

926
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,041
Just a little bit more.

927
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:08,958
We're near.

928
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,833
Right? Give me five.

929
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:13,250
Me too!

930
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,375
We'll make it!

931
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,208
The island!

932
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:37,875
The mouth of the stone man!

933
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:03,666
We're finally here, Ma!

934
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:10,041
You'll see, the fireflies will come.

935
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:12,458
Oh, watch out.

936
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:15,166
Careful, Ton!

937
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,500
Brother.

938
01:21:25,666 --> 01:21:26,916
The fireflies!

939
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,166
They're here!

940
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:50,166
We made it, Ma!

941
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:05,125
I wish I could see my mother again.

942
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:09,541
I wish we could be together.

943
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,458
Please, fireflies.

944
01:22:12,833 --> 01:22:14,750
I want to see her.

945
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,583
Ma?

946
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,250
Ma?

947
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:49,833
Ma?

948
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:52,541
Ma.

949
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,333
Ma!

950
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:56,291
Ma…

951
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,166
Ma!

952
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:03,666
Ma!

953
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,791
Ma!

954
01:23:07,958 --> 01:23:10,791
Don't leave me, Ma.

955
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,708
Don't leave me.

956
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:17,583
Ma!

957
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,458
Ma.

958
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,916
Ma.

959
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,250
Ma!

960
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:30,666
Tonton, it's getting dark!

961
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,916
Rain's coming. Let's go!

962
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,000
Ma.

963
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:40,708
Come now, Ton. Let's go home.

964
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,250
Erika!

965
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:46,458
Billy!

966
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:48,083
-Erika, are you okay?
-I'm okay.

967
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:51,833
Ma!

968
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,958
-Are you okay?
-Tonton!

969
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:55,791
-Louie, get Tonton!
-Tonton!

970
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:57,458
Tonton!

971
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:01,666
-Ton!
-Ton!

972
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,166
-Tonton!
-Tonton!

973
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,250
-Ton!
-Tonton! Tonton!

974
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:42,750
Tonton?

975
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,875
Tonton?

976
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,291
Tonton!

977
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,583
Help.

978
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:14,166
Help!

979
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,583
Ma, help me.

980
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:47,833
Tonton.

981
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:00,791
Stop it!

982
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:10,666
Even now, there are days

983
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:13,291
when I can still hear them barking.

984
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:23,708
Days when I'm still afraid…

985
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:27,708
of what I did.

986
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:38,916
He caught us.

987
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:44,875
He saw us escaping that night.

988
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,250
He stopped us.

989
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:53,916
He wouldn't let us go.

990
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,291
Then I saw my mother.

991
01:28:06,208 --> 01:28:08,583
I said, "Stop it!"

992
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:10,250
Stop it!

993
01:28:10,333 --> 01:28:12,000
Stop it!

994
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:14,166
So I…

995
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,666
I reached for whatever I could find.

996
01:28:23,791 --> 01:28:25,416
To hurt him.

997
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:31,416
Ma!

998
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,833
I don't remember what happened next.

999
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,458
I just know we made it to Manila.

1000
01:28:50,666 --> 01:28:53,958
My mom did her best to raise me

1001
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,958
even though it was difficult.

1002
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:26,125
-Tonton!
-Help!

1003
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:29,583
Help!

1004
01:29:30,708 --> 01:29:33,958
Help me! Ma!

1005
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,583
Help!

1006
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,291
Help!

1007
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:56,958
Mister Louie took me back to Auntie Linda.

1008
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:02,500
There was a reason why she didn't want me
to go to the island.

1009
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,125
As for my father,

1010
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:12,541
no one really knows what happened to him.

1011
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,375
I still don't know.

1012
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:30,541
Auntie Linda…

1013
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:33,625
Tonton?

1014
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:36,625
Come here.

1015
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,875
My dear child.

1016
01:30:41,416 --> 01:30:44,291
How do you feel? Are you okay?

1017
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:47,708
What happened to you, child?

1018
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:51,458
Your mother will haunt me
for what you did!

1019
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:57,083
Mama is gone, Auntie Linda.

1020
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,541
My mother is gone.

1021
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,250
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

1022
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:13,166
I thought her stories were real.

1023
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:18,166
Hush now. Don't cry.

1024
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:27,291
Do you know that your mother grew up here?

1025
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,750
She loved this island.

1026
01:31:36,708 --> 01:31:38,583
I'm sure…

1027
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:44,458
she's happy that you brought her home.

1028
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,333
So don't worry, okay?

1029
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:54,708
Auntie Linda,

1030
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:57,666
can I go back to the island?

1031
01:31:59,125 --> 01:32:02,166
I just want to say goodbye to Mama.

1032
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:06,416
Come here!

1033
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:12,291
I miss your mother too.

1034
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,666
Careful.

1035
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:35,500
Thank you.

1036
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:46,833
Okay. It's time.

1037
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:48,500
Say goodbye to your mother.

1038
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:58,375
I'm sorry, Ma.

1039
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,458
I still can't do it without you.

1040
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,833
I'm not brave enough.

1041
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:27,750
Listen to me, Tonton.

1042
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:30,000
You are brave.

1043
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:32,791
Much braver than you think.

1044
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:38,041
At first, the firefly was afraid.

1045
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,625
How could he fight the beast?

1046
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,291
He was so tiny.

1047
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:45,250
But he fought back

1048
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,791
because he remembered something.

1049
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,875
What did he remember, Ma?

1050
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,333
That he loved the butterfly.

1051
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:56,416
And that love is
so much stronger than fear.

1052
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:37,833
Ton?

1053
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,583
Let's go.

1054
01:34:57,541 --> 01:34:58,916
Thank you.

1055
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,958
Sorry we didn't take him to you sooner.

1056
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:04,333
He really wanted to go.

1057
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:22,375
Fireflies!

1058
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:02,125
They're really here.

1059
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:09,041
Tonton, come! I'll take a photo!

1060
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:12,541
Come on!

1061
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,375
-Let's go!
-Everyone join in! Let's take a picture.

1062
01:36:18,458 --> 01:36:21,416
I'll put it over here so we're all in it.

1063
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:30,041
There!

1064
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:40,625
The time came for
the heavens to take the butterfly away.

1065
01:36:42,166 --> 01:36:45,916
"Our journey ends here,"
the butterfly said to the firefly.

1066
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:51,083
The firefly promised that he would go on,

1067
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:57,250
until at last, he found his light.

1068
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:11,416
The end.

1069
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,791
I don't have any more questions.

1070
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,125
The story is yours.

1071
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:32,041
AUNTIE LINDA
We're here, Ton.

1072
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,708
Ladies and gentlemen,

1073
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,000
this year's recipient

1074
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:54,458
of the National Children's Book Prize is

1075
01:37:54,541 --> 01:37:57,208
Anthony "Tonton" Alvaro.

1076
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:43,708
Congratulations!

1077
01:39:00,041 --> 01:39:02,291
Good day to you all!

1078
01:39:02,958 --> 01:39:09,416
It's an honor
to stand before you today to…

1079
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:00,666
The truth?

1080
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:06,416
I never thought this could happen to me.

1081
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:16,750
During those times
when I couldn't remember who I was,

1082
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:19,750
or what I was capable of,

1083
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:22,666
someone always reminded me,

1084
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:24,833
"Tonton you can do it!"

1085
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:27,833
Maybe it's true.

1086
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,625
We learn to know and love ourselves

1087
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:35,958
because…

1088
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,500
someone loves us first.

1089
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,333
In my life,

1090
01:40:53,041 --> 01:40:54,916
that person's name was

1091
01:40:56,958 --> 01:40:57,958
Elay.

1092
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:04,625
This is for you, Ma.

1093
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:28,291
In her last days,

1094
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,291
my mother told me something

1095
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:32,291
that I'm now beginning to understand.

1096
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:33,416
She said this.

1097
01:41:33,916 --> 01:41:35,750
In life, Ton,

1098
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:39,500
we're just little beings flying by.

1099
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:43,875
Tiny dots in the great, big universe.

1100
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:48,250
But because we loved each other,

1101
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:52,875
even our small lives will leave a story,

1102
01:41:54,666 --> 01:42:00,791
like the firefly and the butterfly,
passing through.

1103
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:28,750
Thank you, Jimmy R. Duavit,
for believing in the island of fireflies.
