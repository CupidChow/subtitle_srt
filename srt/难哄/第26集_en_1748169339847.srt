1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've loved you before.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've loved you before.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've loved you before.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've loved you before.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've loved you before.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm a little small.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I hope you like it.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Mom, why are you only coming back?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm starving.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is...

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll introduce you to a little sister.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She's living in our house recently.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mom, I'm going to play in the bathroom.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Slow down. Don't be so reckless.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you want to eat this? This is super delicious.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've already eaten it. Sorry.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you have anything you want to eat or drink,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
just tell me in detail.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's really delicious.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll try it.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll take you to our secret base.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is our secret base. How is it?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We can watch the movie here.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We can chat in the bedroom.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We can play games here.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you like it?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is my mom's room.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can come in.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My bedroom.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come in.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll tell you.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mom, is this the bathroom?

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's winter.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We're going to the summer house.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We can do whatever we want.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mom, are you playing games?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think you're like

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the ghost in the movie.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's really funny.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I think you're pretty.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your eyes are...

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Jinxin, Yifan.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Come out and eat.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Come on.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, it's time to eat.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you sitting so mad when Yifan comes?

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Usually, you're not allowed to eat or drink.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hurry up and eat, Yifan.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't be polite.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yifan, I'm Chen Xi.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm the Xi of Zhen Xi.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is your name a little...

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I really wanted to change my name.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But my mom told me to know about Zhen Xi.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I said, what's Zhen Xi?

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then you appeared.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
My mom?

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Actually, you're not the first girl

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to come to our house.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Before you came,

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
other girls have also come.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They were not happy just now.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But since they came to our house,

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
all girls have become very happy.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, Yifan,

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you have to believe me.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As long as I'm here,

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can make you happy.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, you eat so much.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You can have a big meal later.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can have a big talk.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yifan, eat more.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm so tired.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you stupid?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't you know how to read?

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have something to eat.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You eat first.

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yifan, you eat more.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I...

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't eat.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Can't you finish it and then eat?

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm tired.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm tired.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can go to the same university with my boyfriend.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can I borrow your computer?

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sure.

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You use it.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sit down.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What do you want?

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Do you want me to help you?

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to change my mind.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You have a boyfriend too.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to leave all the people I know.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to know where I am.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's good.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yifan, don't be afraid.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You should go to the hospital first.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I won't disturb you.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Boss,

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you really don't have to go to the hospital to report.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What?

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Boss,

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
why do you still do it yourself?

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's just call the police.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Boss, you're in a bad mood recently.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You should go to the hospital first.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's all right.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can't you sit down?

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's a big més.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Someone called intellectually could be here.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's an intimate experience

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and a marriage amongst brothers.

130
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,800
Minglan,

131
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,120
why is the mood so good?

132
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,760
Just provide the breakfast and toast to Sun Qiang.

133
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,640
Who is that?

134
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,000
Nobody knows me either.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
Sun Qiang.

136
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,720
It didn't matter.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I've been looking for him for half a year.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've never given up on him for half a year.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He might be in Hong Kong.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How do you know?

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The real Li Hao is very close to him.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He's a young man.

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He's a young man.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's a young man.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's a young man.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He's a young man.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's a young man.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't want to live with him.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know what you're up to.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe I can help you.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know what you're up to.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I heard you don't have a good relationship with him.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You've been very close to him.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I told you that I've made a deal with you.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
About the business of the university.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I was so stupid.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was so stupid to find you a different relationship.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But I saw you didn't have any reaction.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I thought you didn't take it seriously.

160
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then why did you suddenly apologize?

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't know either.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But I guess

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
maybe he's a bad guy with his uncle.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I know that he's been in a bad situation.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I've heard that he's a bad guy.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's not only a bad guy.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He also has a brother.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He didn't tell us.

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He called Qiao Qiao Guan.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Qiao Qiao heard it.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He said that there was a person who called him uncle.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He said a lot of weird things to you.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
From then on,

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
after the college entrance exam,

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I moved to another place.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know where he is.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Where is he now?

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I saw him in the subway in Hong Kong.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I called him.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He didn't reply me.

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then I immediately went to a building.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I looked for him for a few days.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Can you give me the address of the building?

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But I really didn't go to that building.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then anyway,

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Since you said there wasn't any kind of reasons,

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you can just give me the address of this building.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Because no one tells you since you saw it.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's the only reason.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you could show it to your child,

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,880
how many times could there be

194
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,080
that you don't know the reason?

195
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
I didn't agree to bring this to your children.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Look.

197
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,740
Then, how about you tell me you are really a reflex.

198
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,880
I'll give you a moment.

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Look.

200
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,000
I know.

201
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,660
On the other hand I think he is not a nuances person.

202
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,500
Not aист?

203
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
Look.

204
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Their physical appearance is a bit sad.

205
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,900
Little Snow

206
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,260
What's wrong with her meses?

207
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,980
She was way too pretty

208
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,300
Of revealed

209
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,380
BUT Her days

210
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,860
were all so他i

211
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,260
And that would make her upset

212
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,500
Her days

213
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,620
Was covered with 가는 tige

214
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,940
dunno where the clothes are

215
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,060
it's alright

216
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,960

217
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,460

219
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,660

hold onto the Bomb

222
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,260
Let's go.

223
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,740
Big brother, whether kiss is boring in China or not, I don't know.

224
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,100
Sometimes you come back to fight.

225
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,940
How are you going to go to Bramble?

226
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
What's going on?

227
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,260
Attention aftereau Filter

228
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:42,120
document

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,860
No news

230
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,080
Come with me.

231
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,420
Thanks.

232
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,520
Let's go to eat.

233
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,760
I need three more rounds to start.

234
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Are you hungry?

235
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,400
Don't get yourself feasted for work.

236
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,840
If you are, dish out.

237
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,980
I mean,

238
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,260
if you cook vegetable omelet for me in Hong Kong,

239
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,940
I might get fired.

240
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,780
Once I get home

241
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,780
I was in Hong Kong.

242
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,460
I could read books or work.

243
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,460
I dare not do anything in Hong Kong.

244
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,900
I watch the scenery every day.

245
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,460
Your grandma lived in Hong Kong.

246
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,380
Can you call me?

247
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,700
Of course.

248
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,540
But this Hong Kong is not a career.

249
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,540
You look at him with that big glasses.

250
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,940
He feels that he is a good person.

251
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,780
I went to find his soulmate this time.

252
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,500
He said that there was a girl in the room.

253
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,340
I was just about to ask.

254
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,940
He said that girl is...

255
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060
a bad girl.

256
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,860
I haven't found the news of Wen Yifan.

258
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,220
Grandma.

259
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,300
Didn't you ask for some colleagues?

260
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,100
You think I know my grandma

261
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,460
and the people who live in Hong Kong?

262
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,780
I promised many friends

263
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
in the financial and education industry

264
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,140
to help me find her.

265
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,740
Grandma, thank you.

266
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,020
Don't worry.

267
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,700
As long as you have the fate,

268
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,180
we will be together.

269
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,540
Don't worry.

270
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,820
She hasn't been in Hong Kong for a long time.

271
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,140
You two are together now.

272
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,180
I hope I can be together.

273
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,020
Girl.

274
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,540
Have you heard of the new law?

275
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,420
If your opinion is firm enough,

276
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,500
you will get the result you want.

277
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,860
I know how to see people.

278
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,340
He is not like a person who gives up easily.

279
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,020
Right?

280
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,140
Wendy.

281
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,060
Have you decided your size?

282
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,820
They are getting sexy.

283
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,660
So who are they?

284
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,980
Let's play the episodes.

285
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
Are you filming?

286
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:26,860
Let's play.

287
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,420
I prepared many pants this morning.

288
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,060
Great.

289
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,580
Relax.

290
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,820
How to test her?

291
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Hello everybody.

292
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Introduce me to this new teacher.

293
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Miss Wang.

294
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Everyone can vote for Wendy.

295
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Wendy, what's your name?

296
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I remember you.

297
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
You've been in the zoo for a long time.

298
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Now it's nice.

299
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Let me see.

300
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I see.

301
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
I'm Candy.

302
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
I'm Guan.

303
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,820
You're also a hot topic.

304
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
I'm not a hot topic.

305
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
I'm just a hot topic.

306
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I don't know how to talk.

307
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
I'm just a hot topic.

308
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
I'm not a hot topic.

309
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I'm not a hot topic.

310
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
You're a hot topic too.

311
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
Why do you want to be my teacher?

312
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
If I'm your teacher, I'll be fine.

313
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm really good at asking you.

314
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
I want to ask you.

315
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
No problem, Miss Wang.

316
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
Okay.

317
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
I'll teach you

318
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
how to play ballet

319
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
after I'm a teacher.

320
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Okay.

321
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Let's prepare

322
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
for the class.

323
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Okay.

324
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Mom.

325
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
When will you go to Hong Kong?

326
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
You'll be flying in the evening.

327
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Put this on.

328
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I asked you to give me a gift.

329
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,820
Why did you give it to me?

330
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Didn't you go with Hua An?

331
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Look at your skin.

332
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
It's hot every day.

333
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
You have to take care of your skin.

334
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Take care of it.

335
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Go out with it every day.

336
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
It's our Lin Ya.

337
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
She's more thoughtful.

338
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Mom.

339
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
She likes it.

340
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
It's true.

341
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Besides,

342
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
we went to find Wen Yifan.

343
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,820
She can't go out to play.

344
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
I know.

345
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,820
You're very independent now.

346
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,820
I don't know what I should do for you.

347
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
I'm afraid I'll affect you.

348
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Mom.

349
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
What are you talking about?

350
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
What's affecting me?

351
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
I have my own judgment

352
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
about love.

353
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Don't worry about it.

354
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
Okay.

355
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
Okay.

356
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Let's wrap it up together.

357
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
Qiaoqiao.

358
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820
What's the matter with you?

359
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
She's nice.

360
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
She's nice to me too.

361
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Is that so?

362
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I hope she can find a way

363
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,820
to love me

364
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,820
just like other women.

365
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
What's that?

366
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
I don't know.

367
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
It's just a feeling.

368
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
So I'm still waiting.

369
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
What do you think?

370
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,820
If you can find a way

371
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
to promise this time,

372
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
why don't you go to love?

373
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,820
I can do it.

374
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Are you sure?

375
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,060
Sang Yuan, is that really okay?

376
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,820
Last time, Sang Yuan was so disappointed.

377
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Plus, I was afraid that Wei Ying Fan would reject us.

378
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,940
Let's try it today.

379
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,180
That's right.

380
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
The temperament of the year is not the usual.

381
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,420
Even if we find him, how can we persuade him to go back to the South?

382
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
That's also a big problem.

383
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,020
If we can't find Wei Ying Fan,

384
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,780
we're going to have to find a big share in our overtime.

385
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,060
Or, we can sell my shares to you.

386
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,180
And give you Sang Yuan's position.

387
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,780
Stop it.

388
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,380
Don't worry about it.

389
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
Let's find him and talk.

390
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,580
There's a room everywhere.

391
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,260
Mr. Su, welcome to the room.

392
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,180
Is it a room?

393
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,980
Two rooms.

394
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Just one room.

395
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,380
I'm not afraid of anything when I sleep with you.

396
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,580
I think it's better to live in the same room.

397
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,580
Mom, thank you.

398
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,780
You're close to Qian Tai.

399
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,180
No.

400
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:31,380
Actually, I'm here to deal with the matter of the night.

401
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,780
I feel like you're a regular customer.

402
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,380
You've been here with Wang Lin Lin before.

403
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,180
No.

404
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,180
Sign here.

405
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,780
Sign here.

406
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,380
Sign here.

407
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,580
My principle is

408
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,380
not to date a female.

409
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,980
You still have this principle?

410
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,580
A female is to get along with each other in a hurry.

411
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,780
If the values are different from life,

412
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,780
it's because the noisy people can't talk.

413
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,380
And I'm worried that it's not time to break up before I go back.

414
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,580
That's not awkward.

415
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,180
But I...

416
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,180
I'm not worried about you leaving.

417
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,020
Actually,

419
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,780
I'm not worried about anything.

420
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I'm also worried about my life.

421
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,940
I'm also worried about Karin's normal age.

422
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,740
I became more relaxed and free.

423
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,140
I can say anything with you.

424
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,740
I want to cry and laugh.

425
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,140
I think that kind of life is very happy and very solid.

426
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,540
I can't tell you anything.

427
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,140
I want to share anything with you.

428
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,140
But there is something that is a bit complicated.

429
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
What is it?

430
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,340
You are now by my side.

431
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,140
I am in a state of state of mind.

432
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,340
I want to rush up and hug you and hug you.

433
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,740
But I am very hardworking and controlled my desire.

434
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,940
I must be honest with you.

435
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,340
It's very hard.

436
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,340
I want us to be together.

437
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,540
I really like you.

438
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,340
Wait a minute.

439
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,940
What is that?

440
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,940
I don't know.

441
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,140
Why do you still have to prepare for it?

442
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,140
Then I will go and sell it tomorrow.

443
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
Go to sleep.

444
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,140
I... I won't sleep.

445
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,740
Okay, I will go to sleep.

446
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,740
I will go to sleep.

447
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,740
Okay.

448
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,140
You can't sleep?

449
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,140
You can't sleep either.

450
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,340
I will go to sleep.

451
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,340
Okay.

452
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,340
Okay.

453
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,340
Okay.

454
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,340
Okay.

455
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,340
Okay.

456
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,340
Okay.

457
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,340
Okay.

458
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
Okay.

459
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
Okay.

460
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Okay.

461
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,140
Then...

462
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,740
can we send our friends to return to life?

463
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,140
Here.

464
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,540
Thank you.

465
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,740
The school teacher really hates it.

466
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,940
He said he can't give students personal information and accept all the rules.

467
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Teacher, we have to be smarter.

468
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,940
It's too hot. We can't find a way to do it.

469
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,340
You have to be patient, okay?

470
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,940
Hello, do you know Wen Yifan?

471
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,740
Yes.

472
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,740
Mo Xiao, do you know Wen Yifan?

473
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,740
I don't know him.

474
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,140
Thank you.

475
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,740
Hello, do you know Wen Yifan?

476
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
I don't know him.

477
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Let's go.

478
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,940
Okay, we have two weeks left.

479
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,140
We are going to perform on stage.

480
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
Are you nervous?

481
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,140
Yes.

482
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,340
We will practice more if you are nervous.

483
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,540
You are not nervous?

484
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,340
Then, I will continue to show you.

485
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,540
Five feet, stand still.

486
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,940
The map is in the air.

487
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,740
After the double foot is inserted, drop the ground, okay?

488
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,940
Hands up, double hand.

489
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,740
Here.

490
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,740
One, two, three.

491
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,740
Okay, then left foot again.

492
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,140
Stand still, okay?

493
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,940
One, two, three.

494
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,140
Are you happy?

495
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Yes.

496
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,740
You can take the teacher to the room.

497
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,140
Come.

498
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,540
Are you okay?

499
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,140
Yes.

500
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,740
I can teach you.

501
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,940
It's okay, it will be fine soon.

502
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,540
What?

503
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:40,740
Wen Lin, can you show it to the teacher?

504
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Come, get ready.

505
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,740
Three, two, one.

506
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,940
Ah Sen, you are so realistic.

507
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,940
You only dare not to ask girls to treat me to dinner when you are shy.

508
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
You talk a lot.

509
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,740
Don't say nonsense, I often treat you to dinner.

510
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,340
Look, you admit it yourself.

511
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,940
You can just ask how many times you have promised.

512
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,140
I should treat you to dinner today.

513
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,940
Thank you for letting me repeat myself.

514
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,540
It's okay, just treat it as if we will dance.

515
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,340
If he says he has been hurt, he will not dance.

516
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,340
You know that.

517
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Ah Mi, you just came late.

518
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,740
I just talked for a while.

519
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,540
I also talked.

520
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,740
I don't know how many times I have been broken.

521
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
You really worked hard.

522
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,540
I just ate the coconut and the chili.

523
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,340
It's good for people who have been hurt.

524
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,140
I often eat it.

525
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,540
Thank you.

526
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,140
Wow, it's sweet.

527
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,940
It's really good.

528
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,740
But life will only get hurt.

529
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,540
Dancing will get hurt, cutting hair will get hurt.

530
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,340
Even cutting fingers will get hurt.

531
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
But it's okay.

532
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,540
I have been hurt and I am recovering.

533
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,740
After recovering, I will be hurt.

534
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,140
After recovering, I will be burned.

535
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,340
We are five o'clock.

536
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
You know that?

537
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,940
Yes.

538
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,740
So we will meet many mistakes, right?

539
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,340
But the sky is clear.

540
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,740
You have made mistakes 100 times.

541
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,140
You have made mistakes 100 times.

542
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,340
I have made mistakes 100 times.

543
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,540
But we will meet sooner.

544
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,940
We will meet later in the afternoon.

545
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,540
Right?

546
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,940
Right?

547
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
Yes.

548
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,540
So I am very happy now.

549
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Because I have met many mistakes.

550
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,140
Are you happy?

551
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,540
Are you happy?

552
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,740
Maybe.

553
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,540
Are you having many mistakes?

554
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,540
It's really annoying.

555
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,140
Let me eat.

556
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,540
Thank you for asking me to class.

557
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Is there a reason?

558
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,340
Good morning.

559
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,740
Is that still on the screen?

560
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,340
Strong audience is Tai Si Pao.

561
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,340
He was the 2nd member of new 1.8.5A Group.

562
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,340
I remember he stayed there for four years.

563
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,340
He had anlight覺得 in the Baling place.

564
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,340
He is going to play next month.

565
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,380
But when he bought a steak and was ready to celebrate,

566
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,020
the car that was charged with a car was only charged towards him.

567
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,540
So his legs were gone.

568
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,900
He was able to resist for a long time.

569
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,420
Do you know how painful it must be?

570
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,740
His personality is very optimistic and open.

571
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,820
He is a very happy person.

572
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,580
But you know what he said when he came back?

573
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,300
He said,

574
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,340
I think I can be my favorite Hong Kong person and my favorite thing.

575
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,300
He said that.

576
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,580
Hello?

577
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,140
Say something.

578
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,220
Say something.

579
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,100
Who said you were bad? I said he was optimistic.

580
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,380
He is very optimistic.

581
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,340
I doubt you will say bad things to me again.

582
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,180
I really don't.

583
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,700
But it's okay.

584
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,180
I'm closed.

585
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,620
He said he will go to the bar next month.

586
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,420
Yes.

587
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,900
He is a good person.

588
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,700
He is very positive.

589
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,980
He is so realistic.

590
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,180
He will be a part of it if he is positive.

591
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,660
Gui Fan!

592
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,300
Dian Dian!

593
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,980
Where are you going?

594
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,780
Dian Dian!

595
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,340
I miss you so much, Dian Dian!

596
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,980
Why are you thin again?

597
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,100
What's wrong with you?

598
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,300
It's not because of you.

599
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Let's have a private chat tonight.

600
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,580
You still need to go to my hotel.

601
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,660
I have to work today.

602
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,580
What about tomorrow?

603
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,020
Okay.

604
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,540
How do you know I'm here?

605
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,340
Okay.

606
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,940
Yes, me.

607
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,340
I miss you so much.

608
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,820
I've booked the breakfast.

609
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,860
I'll send it to you.

610
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,260
My exams are coming up tonight.

611
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,740
See you at school next Sunday afternoon.

612
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,580
We'll have them over there next night.

613
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,100
You...

614
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,140
Let's see if you'll try to quá silên and knock out your arms to fight back

615
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,560
A couple beats we won't walk in supporter way

616
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,700
We'll drink more

617
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,780
I wooden

618
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:35,220
Taikun

619
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,700
нять

620
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,980
I gotcaca

621
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,740
I play xun

622
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,740
There was nothing done

623
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,140
All this while,

624
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,780
it's still not enough time

625
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,540
to help you right now.

626
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,260
Right?

627
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,460
Sister,

628
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,900
you are good.

629
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
You can still病 me right now.

630
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,020
So let time tell its toll on your side.

631
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,180
That's all.

632
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:06,940
Passport.

633
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,020
After I leave the hotel,

634
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,380
I'll be determined about

635
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,700
my kung fu skills for the rest of my lives.

636
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,860
I'm fine.

637
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
What are you doing?

638
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
I'm charging my skin.

639
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
I've already treated her with a third eye.

640
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
If I find Wei Yifan,

641
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,860
I'll send her a message.

642
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Why don't you let me send her?

643
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,860
She's not taking a break from treating her with a third eye.

644
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
She must have her own reasons.

645
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
You must first check her heart.

646
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
Then let her meet Wei Yifan directly.

647
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Aren't the two of them

648
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
the fastest to make it clear?

649
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
What if she meets a better person

650
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
in this period of time?

651
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,860
Tell you what.

652
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,860
It's impossible.

653
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,860
She's so good at acting.

654
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,860
There must be a lot of people chasing her.

655
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Why is it impossible?

656
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Indeed.

657
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
I think her brother

658
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
is usually very handsome.

659
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Her mouth is bad and her temper is ugly.

660
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Wei Yifan is too simple

661
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
to meet a better person than her.

662
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Even if she doesn't meet a better person,

663
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
she can't be a better person.

664
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
I think she's a good person.

665
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,860
Even if she doesn't meet a better person,

666
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
she must have experienced

667
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
a lot of things

668
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
in the whole year of her life in Hong Kong.

669
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
How do you know

670
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
that the heart of the third eye

671
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
won't change?

672
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,860
What if she doesn't want to

673
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,860
go back to her original words?

674
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
If she doesn't get it back,

675
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
the third eye won't give her a few years.

676
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
It's really hard to get it back.

677
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,860
So,

678
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,860
let's hear what you say tomorrow.

679
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Hurry up.

680
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
Or else,

681
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
you'll be in trouble later.

682
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
I'll go back to my original words.

683
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
What's this?

684
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Heart-pounding sleep.

685
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
No.

686
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
This is my mother's...

687
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I mean,

688
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,860
this is my mother's sleep.

689
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
I don't know

690
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
why she's in my heart.

691
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Let's eat.

692
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Let's eat.

693
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Let's eat.

694
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,860
Let's eat.

695
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
Let's eat.

696
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Let's eat.

697
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
We've been waiting for Yu Zi to tell him.

698
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,860
I can't just ask him

699
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
whether he believes there's a man.

700
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
He won't tell me.

701
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
How about

702
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
we first talk about the situation in Hong Kong.

703
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Let's first get the problem

704
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,820
to the place where you can get up.

705
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,660
How is it?

706
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,940
It's good.

707
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,780
Thank you.

708
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:40,940
Have a look.

709
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,860
Ding Ding.

710
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,220
Sit down.

711
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,980
Thank you.

712
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,980
Look at what she ate.

713
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,060
Did you order?

714
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,860
Not yet.

715
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,700
I'm so happy to find you.

716
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,660
Can I tell Sang Yuan

717
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,860
about your news?

718
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,820
Yes.

719
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,740
She asked you to find Feng.

720
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,780
I told her myself.

721
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,460
Let's have a meal.

722
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:16,700
OK.

723
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,540
I'll order for her.

724
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,020
OK.

725
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:20,700
Thanks.

726
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,820
Who is Fu Xiao?

727
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,580
You think they will think so much?

728
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,420
I know.

729
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,220
Hello, Sang Yuan.

730
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,260
I'm sharing some出來.

731
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
If we really break up,

732
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I'll say it.

733
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
I'll say it.

734
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
I'll say it.

735
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
I'll say it.

736
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Shut up.

737
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
Lin Lin.

738
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
Here you are.

739
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
He's coming to Hong Kong.

740
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

741
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

742
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

743
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

744
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

745
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

746
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
I'll tell you what I want to say.

747
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260

It's better to carry a burden.

You never stop me

I have its meaning

778
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,260
With the time and the river

779

We wait together

780
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
Like sunshine

781
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,260

783
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,260
You are in the wind

784
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,260
She doesn't want me to come

785
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,260
You are always standing by me

786
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,260
For me and guess

787
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,260
I can't stop this road

788
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Full of sweet rain and full of land

789
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,260
But I have you

790
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Like you

791
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:22,260
Can show the darkness before my eyes

792
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,260
All thoughts and memories are you

793
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,260
We are youthful and beautiful

794
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Every rain and rain

795
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,260
You are in the middle of the road

796
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Full of sweet rain and full of land

797
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,260
But I have you

799
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,260
Can show the darkness before my eyes

800
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
I won't give up

801
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:55,260
I will be here with you

802
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,260
You are in the wind

803
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,260
She doesn't want me to come

804
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,260
You are always standing by me

805
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,260
For me and guess

806
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,260
I can't stop this road

807
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,260
Full of sweet rain and full of land

808
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,260
But I have you

809
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,260
I won't give up

810
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,260
I won't give up

811
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,260
You gave me a chance

812
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,260
And I will come

813
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,260
You are in the wind

814
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,260
She doesn't want me to come

815
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,260
Even if it's still a wish

816
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,260
I won't be lonely anymore

817
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,260
I see you are here

818
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,260
Like you

819
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Can show the darkness before my eyes

820
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
