1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to see you again.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've ever loved you.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello, Ma.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Where are you?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We can't find you in the 3M6 system.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're done with your graduation.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's go home and have a meal together.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to find a friend.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We also had a date at night.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's all. Bye.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's not coming with us to have a meal.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's been waiting for so long.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's a mortal.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go inside and have a look.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He's going to find someone.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's coming.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's coming.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wei Yifan.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come on.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Wei Yifan.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're not happy.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yifan.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yifan.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yifan.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go back to your room.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The other student is going to give him a discount.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yifan.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Everyone, find your own seat.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone, be happy.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Three, two, one.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All together.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
One more.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone, be happy.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
All right.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Be happy.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
One more.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, take a look.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Do you know that

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I saw a handsome guy just now.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Really?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yifan, I'm glad that you didn't change your mind.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're going to see a handsome guy.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Someone called me.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I called you.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Take a good picture and take a picture.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Take a look.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Be happy.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How could it be him?

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, come on.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're going to have dinner.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Just one.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the home meal that auntie made.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This meal is my favorite.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on, Su, eat.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Eat.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Eat.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Use your strength.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a good man.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Grandpa, he's a guest.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Isn't he a good boyfriend?

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A boyfriend is still a guest.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Grandpa.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Eat.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Su, you're embarrassing me.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Come on.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Eat.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Eat.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can eat.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Drink a cup.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll drink with you.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Just be yourself.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm just like grandpa and grandma.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Think about it.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're usually the most comfortable to eat.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Last time I was at your house.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You were eating breakfast.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You look like a ghost.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Brother, what are you laughing at?

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm laughing at you.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't drink.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just made a beautiful drink.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you tell me that?

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I didn't tell you.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let me change the food.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Cheers.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't drink.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't drink.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Here.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll drink with you.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Here.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Here.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Drink less.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Today I should let you go to the kitchen.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Dad, don't treat him so well.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He said so.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can only listen to him.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Actually, I like it.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's sitting at home and eating.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Last time I saw you

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in the window.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
When you were taking care of me.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I thought

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
how good it would be to sit down and eat together.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We're all hungry.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're hungry.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're right.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go to the kitchen.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll eat.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll start to be polite.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Be polite.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Eat.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Have you eaten?

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Very good.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's good.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm happy to eat with your family.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're happy.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Really?

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I often dream about it.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If my dad is still alive.

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I hope we can

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
eat together.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Talk together.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you know

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was standing at your place

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that year.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I thought about jumping.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If I wanted to jump.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Everything in my life

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
would be gone.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's good.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's good.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We can only live

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
with hope and dreams.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I decided to be like his mom.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you doing?

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The fruit is cut.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come back and eat.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Come back.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Here you are.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you find our boss?

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Go upstairs.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll go upstairs.

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Do you want a drink?

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No.

175
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,620
This isiden

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Xu An,

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,860
I've told you

178
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
it's you.

179
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,000
There's a reason why I don't watch the movies.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,900
But

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
there's something.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's it?

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Li Fan,

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
I haven't seen my uncle for so long.

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,160
Don't you know how to say hello?

186
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,560
Shuang Jing.

187
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,560
Are you okay?

188
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
Who are you?

189
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,800
Who am I?

190
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Who am I to save you?

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
No.

192
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,000
No?

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,160
No, Shuang Jing.

194
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
Do you have conscience?

195
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,080
You used to eat my food.

196
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
I remember.

197
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,680
I forgot.

198
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,800
Give me a hand.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I know you.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Zhang Kai.

201
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you doing?

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,800
Go home.

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Let go.

204
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
Can't you hear me?

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What do you mean?

206
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Boss bullies me.

207
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Why do you want to hit me?

208
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Who hit you?

209
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
One more.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Come on. Hit me.

211
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Why didn't I see you?

212
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
What do you mean?

213
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
You mean

214
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
I want to hit you?

215
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay.

216
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
You know each other.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Fang Jing.

218
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Xiao Hei.

219
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Tongtong.

220
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Who are you?

221
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,800
My aunt's brother.

222
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm not an uncle.

223
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
He's always like this.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He's so much like you.

225
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know him.

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
He's not a good person.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,400
If he comes again next time,

228
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
you should treat him as a stranger.

229
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Don't mind him.

230
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Sit down.

231
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
Let me go.

232
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'll be right there.

233
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
Is there anything wrong?

234
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Nothing.

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
You can't say anything.

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let me go.

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Don't worry.

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
It's nothing serious.

239
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Really.

240
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
I can solve it myself.

241
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Go back to your work.

242
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Let go.

243
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
Can't you hear me?

244
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm afraid of the讀芳.

245
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
She has always taken care of me.

246
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I won't close the benim, okay?

247
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,600
You only can see me.

248
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,800
Are you review me?

249
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,200
But you stayed with me.

250
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
You want me to sleep with you?

251
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm leaving.

252
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Will you come with me to the island?

253
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Then...

254
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Just let me go, okay?

255
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I don't want to be friends with you.

256
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I'll be around you.

257
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,800
But they will be more persistent than me.

258
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
But I have no love for you.

259
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
But I have no love for us.

260
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,800
But I have no boyfriend.

261
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm sorry.

262
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,800
You are the only one who has no heart.

263
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
This is my room.

264
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
No.

265
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
This is my room.

266
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
No.

267
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
This is my room.

268
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
This is my room.

269
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I know.

270
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Then why are you here?

271
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
What do you mean? Why am I here?

272
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Or you should be here.

273
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
You are so careless.

274
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
I mean why are you here?

275
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Why am I here?

276
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
You said I'm not here.

277
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Think about it.

278
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Think about it.

279
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
You are also a dreamer.

280
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Dreamer?

281
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
You said you are a dreamer.

282
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm not a dreamer.

283
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I was afraid of sleeping last night.

284
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
So I came here.

285
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
So?

286
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
So you want to sleep with me.

287
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Think about it.

288
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
You said you dreamed last night.

289
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
You broke into my room and opened my quilt.

290
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
You said I was lying down.

291
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Can I lie down like you?

292
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Dreamer?

293
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I can be a dreamer.

294
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
But I'm too wild.

295
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Why are you laughing?

296
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm laughing.

297
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Sang Yan.

298
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm Wen Yifan.

299
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,800
You and Sang Yan are the only ones who didn't come.

300
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Sorry.

301
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
I think Sang Yan is more like a girl.

302
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I thought you were...

303
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Report.

304
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
No, I mean we alive?

305
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
But you still look up.

306
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,800
Get out of your way, try this.

307
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,840
I said if we live by fear,

308
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,720
we'll go after food.

309
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,400
But you are a celebrity,

310
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,440
you lost to the sky and Don't you have the power to be happy?

311
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Is it good?

312
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,440
It's good for the throat and mouth.

313
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Is it good for the throat and mouth?

314
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,440
It's interesting.

315
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Have you made progress?

316
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Of course.

317
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Sun Yan.

319
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,440
If that person goes to work overtime again,

320
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,440
no matter what he says or wants,

321
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
you can ignore him.

322
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
What are you thinking about?

323
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I will never be like Mo Shenzhuo

324
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
when I'm with you.

325
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
It's the same for both of you.

326
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Besides you,

327
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
who can take the money from me?

328
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Wait.

329
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
Wait.

330
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Wait.

331
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Wait.

332
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Wait.

333
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Wait.

334
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Wait.

335
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Wait.

336
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Wait.

337
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Wait.

338
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Mr. Fan.

339
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Mr. De, please put the things here.

340
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
It's not enough.

341
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
Okay.

342
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
I'll put it here.

343
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
You can take it.

344
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Okay.

345
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Thank you, Mr. De.

346
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
It's okay.

347
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
Go to work.

348
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Mr. Fan.

349
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Mo.

350
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Where did you get that book?

351
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
When did you come to book a book?

352
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
In this time.

353
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Recently, the TV station is not in good condition.

354
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
He came to book a book.

355
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
He is honest and kind.

356
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
He often helps me to make money.

357
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
What?

358
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Have you seen him before?

359
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
No.

360
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
First time.

361
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Yifan,

362
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
you will come to my dinner party.

363
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Okay.

364
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
See you tonight.

365
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I will be late.

366
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I need to take care of my health.

367
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
It's okay.

368
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I'll wait for you.

369
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
You drink with him alone.

370
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Let's drink together.

371
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
It's okay.

372
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
Sorry.

373
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Bye.

374
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Hello.

375
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Hello, Yifan.

376
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Today is my birthday party.

377
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
If you can't come,

378
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I'm afraid you won't see me again.

379
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Okay.

380
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
I'll be there soon.

381
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
When are you off work?

382
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
If you leave early,

383
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
don't wait for me.

384
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
I'll eat here with my colleague.

385
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Hello, Miss.

386
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
You're off work?

387
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Be safe.

388
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Wang Jiang.

389
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Hello, Miss.

390
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Wang Jiang.

391
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
What are you doing?

392
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Are you seeing ghosts?

393
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
What do you want?

394
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
You have to go back to Nanwu.

395
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
I can't do it.

396
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
It's not about any misunderstanding.

397
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
I just talked to your sister.

398
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
You didn't listen to me.

399
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
You didn't?

400
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
Yes.

401
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
No.

402
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you know how I've been doing in those days?

403
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I've been living a life without a life.

404
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It's been years.

405
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Don't you think it's funny?

406
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm...

407
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
When we were in college,

408
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I still won the job.

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
I still affected the relationship

410
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
between my rich boyfriend and me.

411
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
I didn't.

412
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
But because of you,

413
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
my life has changed.

414
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
It's like this now.

415
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
His mother's will is to say

416
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
who I'm related to.

417
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Uncle, now...

418
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Life is hard.

419
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
You'll help me, right?

420
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Right?

421
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Tell me.

422
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
If I can't keep going,

423
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I'll find you anywhere.

424
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
And I'll tell everyone

425
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
that you've been dating before.

426
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Right?

427
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
I want to be a fool.

428
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,440
If you don't believe me,

429
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,440
your true heart will be cleaned up.

430
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm a woman now.

431
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
You're the one who has to take responsibility for me.

432
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Right?

433
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Right?

434
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Sister Yifan.

435
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Uncle Le, why are you here?

436
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
It's okay.

437
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
I just got off work.

438
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
I saw a person coming over

439
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
to talk to him.

440
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
You're quite responsible.

441
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,440
It's okay. I'll go first.

442
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Take care at home.

443
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Are you okay, Sister Yifan?

444
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
No.

445
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Let's go, Yifan.

446
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Everyone is waiting for you.

447
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
Is it too small?

448
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Come on.

449
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Come on.

450
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Come on.

451
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Let's all be together.

452
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Is it okay?

453
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Then we'll help her.

454
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Let's take a big picture.

455
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't forget us when you go out.

456
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Okay.

457
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Come on.

458
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Come on.

459
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Don't forget us.

460
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
Don't be afraid.

461
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Don't be afraid.

462
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Don't be afraid.

463
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
Don't be afraid.

464
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
I'll help you.

465
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I'll help you.

466
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
I'll help you.

467
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
I'll help you.

468
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
I'll help you.

469
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I'll help you.

470
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Why are you here?

471
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
What a coincidence.

472
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm not here to eat with you.

473
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Did you just get off work or from work?

474
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Not from work.

475
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I just got off work.

476
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Who's going?

477
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Mo Chenyu.

478
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
He's officially resigned today.

479
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,440
That's a pity.

480
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
He's quite happy.

481
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,440
He's always trying to be an actor.

482
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's do what's happy for us.

483
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Please.

484
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
A while ago,

485
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Chen Xingde and a friend drove out to play.

486
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
He got into a car accident.

487
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
He hit a small shop.

488
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
He wanted to drive them out.

489
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,440
He promised to work hard.

490
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,440
I heard he found a proper job.

491
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Don't worry.

492
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
What's wrong?

493
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm not feeling well.

494
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Are you feeling better?

495
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
No.

496
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
I want to go home.

497
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Tell me what's wrong.

498
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Today,

499
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
I went to see a friend at the hotel.

500
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
He's a little bit old.

501
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
He's going to die.

502
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
And he doesn't look well.

503
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
It's hard to talk to others.

504
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
It's been a long time.

505
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
You're so serious.

506
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
You're sleeping?

507
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Not yet.

508
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I'll sleep later.

509
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
I'll go upstairs.

510
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Okay.

511
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
He's smoking.

512
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,640
When you can't get up,

513
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,800
you realize how sad it must be.

514
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,140
I'm running call warten at his birth.

515
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,640
Mom,

516
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,940
you thank me a lot.

517
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,440
Tell you what?

518
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,640
You think itin?

519
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,240
How could he lie down inside like that?

520
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
That's the film.

521
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Brother Yan.

522
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,440
Brother Yan.

523
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
What's wrong?

524
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
The people who came to the world bureau

525
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
and the reporter of the TV station.

526
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
What did they do?

527
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
They reported that the military made them

528
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
to be poisoned by food.

529
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
They even reported that the TV station

530
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
was exposed to us.

531
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
It's the one who sent the message

532
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
to the station of the company.

533
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
That's impossible.

534
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I don't know if it's true or not.

535
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I...

536
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,440
I'll go and check.

537
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
Hello, the CCTV station of the Bureau of Public Affairs.

538
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
The report from the bureau.

539
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Maybe there's a dead-end

540
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
and not clean food in the station.

541
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
We have to do some work

542
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
on the environment and the financial situation.

543
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
I'm the boss of this restaurant.

544
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
If there's any filial piety,

545
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
we can do it.

546
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
You're right.

547
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
The food in the house

548
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
is all eaten by us.

549
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Why do we eat it?

550
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,440
It's all your fault.

551
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
It's okay to eat it.

552
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
It doesn't mean I eat it.

553
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Look at my friend.

554
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
He said he saw you

555
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
and gave you a ghost.

556
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
You're still framing us.

557
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
I'm a ghost.

558
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
You're in danger.

559
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
It's my problem.

560
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Sir, calm down.

561
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
What's your problem?

562
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
No money.

563
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
The court is on trial.

564
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
I can't let you

565
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
bring up more people

566
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
in these dark and dirty shops.

567
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
If not,

568
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
I'll make this trouble big.

569
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
I'll go to the court.

570
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,440
Got it.

571
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
The medical fee

572
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
for your friend,

573
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
the medical fee for the medical workers,

574
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
and the mental compensation fee.

575
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,440
We'll pay you all for your overtime.

576
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
But I have only one request.

577
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
If you finally check it out,

578
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
it'll cause your friend's food poisoning

579
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,440
to be not our overtime worker.

580
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
I'll ask the journalist again.

581
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,440
You'll apologize in person.

582
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Okay.

583
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Okay.

584
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Ding,

585
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
come back with me.

586
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
I'll go with you.

587
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
Go check it out.

588
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
I'll go check it out.

589
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I'll go check it out.

590
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
Okay.

591
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Yan,

592
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
how about the nurse?

593
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm busy.

594
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Don't tell me

595
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
about this.

596
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
Okay.

597
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Thanks.

598
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
You're welcome.

599
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,440
We'll go now.

600
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
I'll call you later.

601
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Thank you.

602
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Listen,

603
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
this shop is their only place.

604
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
This is their home.

605
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,440
Their food security is absolutely wrong.

606
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
My friend went out of the house,

607
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
and went straight to the shop.

608
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
He just took the 120 away.

609
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
How long do you have to work?

610
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I have to work every day.

611
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
After we finish work,

612
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
we'll clean the kitchen

613
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
and leave.

614
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
You must help them.

615
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
We can't kill them.

616
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Yan,

617
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Yan,

618
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
you're not like this.

619
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
You're a black-hearted man.

620
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,440
You're all evil.

621
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Okay.

622
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Which one of you

623
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
cuts meat?

624
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Which one of you cuts vegetables?

625
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
I cut meat for this.

626
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
I cut vegetables for this.

627
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
I'm a separate person.

628
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
I won't ask

629
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
for anything from the store.

630
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Okay, take a photo.

631
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
My ingredients are all the same.

632
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
There's no business.

633
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Right.

634
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
I won't ask for my life.

635
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
What's wrong?

636
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Don't you want to pay for your daughter's savings?

637
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
I...

638
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Half of the compensation

639
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
is yours.

640
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay?

641
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
No, no.

642
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
It's okay.

643
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Okay.

644
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Look.

645
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I can do some research.

646
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm a good tea maker.

647
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Jiu Bin,

648
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
there's a problem with his food.

649
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
His poison is very strong.

650
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
It's hard to eat it.

651
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
The bigger the food,

652
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
the more we share it.

653
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Understand?

654
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Yes.

655
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Before the video is uploaded,

656
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
you must wait for the results.

657
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Wait for the results?

658
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

659
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
What's up?

660
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Jian Nian,

661
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
something happened at work.

662
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Why didn't you tell me?

663
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
What happened?

664
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I saw the wind on the wall.

665
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
So I called Su Hao An.

666
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
He said

667
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
someone was poisoning the food at work.

668
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
That person is going to be compensated.

669
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
He's going to be called a reporter.

670
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
Your colleague is going to be the one to blame.

671
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Didn't they tell you?

672
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
I've been resting lately.

673
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
He didn't tell me.

674
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I think he must have offended

675
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
someone.

676
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
That's why he did this.

677
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Okay, I understand.

678
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Okay, bye.

679
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Listen,

680
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
just their shop

681
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,440
and their work.

682
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Their food is safe.

683
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,440
There's no problem.

684
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
My friend Yu went out.

685
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
He just got off the train.

686
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
He just got off the train.

687
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Who went to work?

688
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
I...

689
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
When you were in college,

690
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
I still had a relationship

691
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
with that rich guy.

692
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
If I can't go on,

693
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,440
I can't find you

694
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
anywhere else.

695
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Let go!

696
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Can't you hear me?

697
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
I've been living and dying

698
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
for so many years.

699
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
See you later.

700
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I did it on purpose.

701
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
Jing,

702
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
I heard Jiajia say

703
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
you seem to be in love

704
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
with her manager.

705
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
Is she

706
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
still working at the restaurant?

707
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
I heard from your uncle

708
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
that the restaurant

709
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
isn't a serious place.

710
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Jing,

711
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
can you tell me

712
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
if you can't

713
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
go too far with those

714
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
from the three-way line?

715
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
Jing,

716
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
did you go to work?

717
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
No.

718
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
I'm not going to work.

719
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
I said I'd go to work at home.

720
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
I...

721
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
I don't know.

722
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
This is the last time

723
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I've come to see you.

724
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
You guys

725
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
don't want to see each other anymore.

726
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Don't bother me.

727
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Don't think about me.

728
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Don't think about me.

729
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Don't think about me.

730
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
I'll be in trouble

731
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
if something happens.

732
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
I'll beat you to death.

733
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
I'll be in trouble if something happens.

734
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
I'll be in trouble if something happens.

735
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Don't bother me.

736
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,440
I'm still annoying.

737
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Open the door.

738
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Why didn't I bring the key?

739
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Why did you...

740
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Ah Jiang.

741
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Why didn't you clean the floor?

742
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
What do you want to do?

743
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
I don't care

744
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
why you guys are in trouble.

745
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Please don't make a scene.

746
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
You can just live your life

747
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
and die.

748
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
It has nothing to do with me.

749
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
What are you talking about?

750
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
You're going to

751
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
make us die

752
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
if you don't want to see each other anymore.

753
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
What do you mean?

754
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
It has nothing to do with you.

755
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
If you

756
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
and you

757
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
come to harass me

758
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
or the people around me,

759
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I'll call the police immediately.

760
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Call the police?

761
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
Why do you like calling the police so much?

762
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Listen to me.

763
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Don't forget

764
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
to keep your face on us.

765
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Don't hold back.

766
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
Do I need to help you

767
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
to remember how to keep my face on you?

768
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Do you need it?

769
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Why can't I

770
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
rely on anyone

771
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
to live my life?

772
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Why do you want to show up here?

773
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Ah Jiang.

774
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Your aunt...

775
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
She really relied on you

776
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
for the past two years.

777
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
We can't turn our backs on her.

778
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Zhou Yuanqin.

779
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
The operating fee you gave

780
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
was my dad's.

781
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
And the tuition fee

782
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
you asked for was also my dad's.

783
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
And the money

784
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
you guys made for the business.

785
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Did she let you pay for it?

786
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,440
I have to tell you clearly

787
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
that all the money

788
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
was given by your dad.

789
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Don't you trust her?

790
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Ask your mom.

791
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Ask her.

792
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
And you.

793
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Why did you let me

794
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
have a crush on you for so many years?

795
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
It's you.

796
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
You can't

797
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
dare to have a crush on me.

798
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Wei Yifan.

799
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
What did you say to me?

800
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
How did you become like this?

801
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Did you

802
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
even learn to break the law?

803
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
I learned to break the law.

804
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm worried about

805
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
my learning.

806
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Will it be too late?

807
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I'll say it again.

808
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
If you

809
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
ever mess with me again,

810
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
I'll kill you.

811
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,440
I'll kill you.

812
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I'll kill you.

813
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm done.

814
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm leaving.

815
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
A Jian.

816
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Well,

817
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I just called my uncle.

818
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm done.

819
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Do you have any money?

820
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Give me some money.

821
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
I don't have money.

822
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
I won't return it to you.

823
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Give me some money.

824
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I said I don't have money.

825
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,440
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

826
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
I really don't have money.

827
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
I really don't have money.

828
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Let me go.

829
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
No, no.

830
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
I don't want it.

831
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Wait for me to open the company.

832
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,440
I'll go with you.

833
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,440
I'll go home now.

834
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Wen Shuang.

835
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Are you okay?

836
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Who is he?

837
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,440
It's not him.

838
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Go home.

839
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
I'm sorry.

840
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm sorry.

841
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I'm sorry.
