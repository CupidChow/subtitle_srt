1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I once loved you

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
forever

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In order to ask Yifan

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sang Yan has already beaten up other students

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The fight is over

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We have already dealt with the injured students

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Now we have to deal with them

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's your problem of early love

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't have early love

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, we didn't have early love

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I like it when I'm single

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I understand that youth is a bad thing for love

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But you are so heavy now

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You will be distracted early love

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Sang Yan, can you just make your passion

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
into a hard-working motivation

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You go to college and be mature

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You don't eat when you talk about love

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Teacher

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yifan

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You really have to spend more time

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't worry too much

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ok

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ok, no big deal

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can communicate

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's it, I'm going to class

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are done

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are so good at teaching

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you, teacher

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Rest well

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are back

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So thank you

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,080
He is

35
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, you shouldn't have come here

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You come again

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why can you introduce yourself

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
This department is called

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,000
My school is very close to the national college

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,080
Zhou Ying, except for these tower church buildings,

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,940
none of them isла the top plain.

42
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,380
Suppose that there are more buildings,

43
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,220
then forklips can enjoy the next mostESS general.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,400
Zhi Ji.

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:52,820
Please don't finish them,

46
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
My mother's brother is in the North Sea.

47
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,820
We're going to move there.

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
I tell you, after you transfer,

49
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,820
you have to completely break the relationship with this guy.

50
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
Do you hear me?

51
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Goodbye.

52
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
What time do you move?

53
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm almost done. What's wrong?

54
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,820
I'm here to buy pizza for you.

55
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,820
Someone wants to eat it.

56
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
Why don't you teach me to sell it?

57
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
You still like pizza.

58
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Is it because you want to eat it?

59
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
I mean, is it because you want to eat it?

60
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
I want to eat it.

61
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
It's a little dirty.

62
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
It's the New Year.

63
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
Why are there still so many people eating pizza?

64
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Why isn't it Brother Duan Jiaxu?

65
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Who is Brother Duan Jiaxu?

66
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
What do you mean?

67
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
What does it say?

68
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
It says yes.

69
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Yes?

70
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Li Shang?

71
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
You two are the same age?

72
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Two years old.

73
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Two years old?

74
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
I told you.

75
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Sister is so pretty.

76
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,820
My brother is so ugly.

77
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
It's just a collaboration.

78
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,820
My sister is Sang Zhi.

79
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
She is his sister.

80
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,820
I'm Wen Yifan.

81
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
I'll do it.

82
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Thank you.

83
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Please, sister.

84
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
My mother doesn't let me eat at home.

85
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
I just came here to solve my brother's problem.

86
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
No one has ever eaten pizza in the New Year.

87
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
You're so annoying.

88
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
There are still quite a lot of people.

89
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
I only bought it for half an hour.

90
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Here.

91
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
Eat.

92
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
Go to the Internet and study.

93
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,820
You still have to study in the New Year?

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
I'm three years old.

95
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Is it because there are too many relatives at home?

96
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
It's noisy.

97
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
It's hard to study.

98
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,820
There are no relatives.

99
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,820
The people in the big Han are still here.

100
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,820
My parents are at home.

101
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
My brother doesn't go home.

102
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
It's cold.

103
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,820
It's cold.

104
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Didn't you say you didn't come back before the New Year's Eve?

105
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
There are too many relatives at home.

106
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
I can't eat anymore.

107
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Yifan.

108
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Did you say something to my brother?

109
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,460
Tell him.

110
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,920
Give me ten yuan.

111
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,020
Ten yuan in a day, also?

112
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,820
Yes.

113
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Dream on.

114
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Your birthday is approaching.

115
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,820
You could look pretty if you weren't going to eat.

116
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Take this.

117
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
You're a good tiara.

118
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,320
We were just thinking about everything.

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,040
What about you?

120
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,920
You said that time

121
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,560
I didn't lose it at that time

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
But my brother lost it

123
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,400
I can only lose it

124
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:44,960
No

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,760
No

126
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,900
You...

127
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,720
What's wrong?

128
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,800
Just...

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,840
don't take it you can't see me, and I won't Brothers.

130
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,080
I tend to think it as a career in the house.

131
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,560
It still makes sense, even in Realty.

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,260
But what I'll do is just tell him that it's him.

133
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,040
I wonder how he would do.

134
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't know.

135
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,380
I didn't buy the aurora cake.

136
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,340
Then, do you remember your brother's謊號碼?

137
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,440
I don't remember.

138
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,420
Then what is your brother like?

139
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,640
He's very handsome and everyone likes to play with him.

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,940
How big is it?

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,660
This small stage on the Nazizing Bridge line

142
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,540
Is it those film guitars list?

143
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,760
Whose group is it?

144
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,620
Xindu

145
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,980
What brand is this?

146
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,320
It's Xindu God Lead

147
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,080
What about Binhue?

148
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,140
Who's your brother?

149
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,780
Who?

150
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,740
Is this his?

151
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,540
This...

152
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,660
This monstrousheen!

153
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,820
I can't be more blevatic.

154
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,100
That is too much.

155
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,500
Not really.

156
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,300
I feel a little tired.

157
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,540
Thanks for everything.

158
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,040
Sister, how can I resist that?

159
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,440
I feel bad for myself.

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,380
Who were going to force me to accept

161
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,480
like that?

162
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,500
This buzzer is not perfect.

163
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,420
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said work.

164
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,380
So what.

165
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
Let's go, sister. Let's go eat pizza.

166
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,940
I'm not hungry. You guys eat.

167
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,140
Oh, right. In these mushrooms and in this fridge,

168
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,180
there are many delicious things.

169
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,340
If you want to eat something, you can take it yourself.

170
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,380
It's basically your brother's stuff.

171
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,980
Wait, sister.

172
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,180
Why are you being my brother's roommate?

173
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,420
It's a coincidence.

174
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,380
It's fate.

175
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,620
Have you eaten?

176
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,180
Hurry and go eat.

177
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,340
I'm going to work.

178
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Then go to work.

179
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,580
There is so much to draw!

180
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,840
Right!

181
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Come to your senses.

182
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,140
The room-w core is still open.

183
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,060
Come back.

184
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,940
Give him time to run the house.

185
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,540
No, she somewhere else.

186
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,280
Come back.

187
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,980
What are you doing?

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,000
Let mecolanduse my meal.

189
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,940
What is she like?

190
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,540
I!

191
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,140
There's nothing to remember

192
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,580
like when you~!

193
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,300
Did she even...

194
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,480
I'll play!

195
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,620
I think they are similar trots

196
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,180
Why are you talking like my mother?

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,880
Then what's your problem with her?

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,540
She treated me quite nice

199
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,600
She asked me to order something

200
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
So, you have to try it out on her

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,760
I'm afraid that Li Qin Shu's grandma didn't come to serve me that day.

202
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,760
Free, Klab.

203
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,300
Normally, I'll only taste whenever I'm hungry.

204
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,100
I know!

205
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,960
Come in.

206
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,020
Sister, my brother getting me hotpot.

207
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Go eat with us.

208
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,880
Of course not.

209
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay.

210
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Let's go.

211
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,880
You still can eat?

212
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,880
My brother said that you should eat hot pot with your team.

213
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Hurry up and sit here.

214
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

215
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
You can ask Wang Xiao Ping to eat.

216
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Eat?

217
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes.

218
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
You're so cute.

219
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Why are you laughing?

220
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
He's complimenting Xiao Ming.

221
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
What's wrong?

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
You don't dare to say that to me.

223
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Your name is too close.

224
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
You'd better say that to your dad.

225
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
You're so stubborn.

226
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
By the way, Zhi Zhi.

227
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Are you going to college soon?

228
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Which college do you want to go to?

229
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Not yet.

230
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
I want to go to the basketball school or the university of the same class.

231
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
You can go to the basketball school?

232
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,880
If there's no accident, then you can go to the university.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I'm afraid that the school will be closed.

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Actually, you don't need to be so stressed.

235
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
The university of the same class is quite good.

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
The advantages of each of them are that the distance between the two universities is far from the south.

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
And the climate is different from here.

238
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
You can consider this.

239
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Which university did you graduate from?

240
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,880
The university of the same class.

241
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,880
No wonder you don't know much about it.

242
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Which major did you graduate from?

243
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
The network and the new media.

244
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Isn't the network and the new media of the south university better?

245
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
If you only talk about this major,

246
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
the south university will be better.

247
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Then you've chosen a major.

248
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Why are you looking at me?

249
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Keep talking.

250
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I also want to know

251
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
what the reason is.

252
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
I want to know

253
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
what the reason is.

254
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
I want to know

255
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
what the reason is.

256
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
I want to know

257
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
what the reason is.

258
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
What is the reason?

259
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I also want to know

260
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
what the reason is.

261
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Is it the reason for you to be so stressed?

262
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Why are you so stressed?

263
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Don't tell me.

264
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I don't want you to be stressed.

265
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Why are you so stressed?

266
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Why are you so stressed?

267
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I don't want to tell you.

268
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Why are you so stressed?

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,520
You are pregnant with me with them, mother!

270
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,120
Take care.

271
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,040
I'm pregnant withown you.

272
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,120
My terrifying intervention has finished.

273
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,880
Bai is telling lies to me.

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
I'll never deceive myself.

275
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,680
You are about to be cheers to me.

276
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,160
I won't lie.

277
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,120
Yummy, come in, eat something!

278
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,960
Do you love me?

279
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,800
No.

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
I heard from my parents

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,880
that my brother

282
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,080
had a crush on me

283
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,400
when he was in high school.

284
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,240
I just remembered...

285
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,880
Xiao Gui.

286
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,480
What are you doing?

287
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,720
I'm leaving.

288
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,480
Go home.

289
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,080
I just started eating.

290
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,920
I need to stay here for a while.

291
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,480
Your parents are coming home soon.

292
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,240
I'll escort you home.

293
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,120
Let's go.

294
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,360
No, I still want to eat.

295
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,280
Eat?

296
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Who can eat more than you?

297
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,080
They're going to...

298
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,960
Hall of Fame,

299
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,520
Episode 32

300
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,720
Why are you looking at them?

301
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,440
Sir,

302
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
what about you, Y housewife?

303
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,480
Don't you thinkglass is a great choice?

304
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,520
Why don't you have good attend보um in upstairs?

305
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
Tell us about it.

306
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,760
You're too much.

307
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,080
You won't like girls.

308
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,000
What's my attitude?

309
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
Usually I like

310
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,680
gentle and nice skin.

311
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,080
I won't ignore people.

312
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm careful.

313
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,480
It's okay if the family is not in a good mood.

314
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,360
Just like Brother Jia Xu.

315
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Who?

316
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,600
Brother Jia Xu.

317
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
You know that?

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,880
So you

319
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,720
don't have to worry about it.

320
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
You should work hard.

321
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,360
Don't stay at home

322
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
as a homeless person.

323
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
Do you have any other work

324
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
other than breakfast?

325
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,040
I do.

326
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,320
But I don't know

327
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,480
why I quit.

328
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,640
Do you think

329
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,120
my brother is a bit suspicious?

330
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,600
Is there anything else

331
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,640
on your job?

332
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Hit.

333
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,080
Hit.

334
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,080
You were dreaming?

335
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,680
You have a whole plane.

336
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
I'm not afraid of you.

337
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,760
You're not afraid of your parents beating you up.

338
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Tell me about it.

339
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Qiao Feizhou.

340
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm leaving.

341
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
I know you have something to do.

342
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm leaving.

343
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm leaving.

344
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm leaving.

345
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,760
You didn't go home to live?

346
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
It's too noisy at home.

347
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,760
How can it be noisy?

348
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
I used to play fireworks when I was a kid.

349
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Did you play fireworks in your house?

350
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Very little.

351
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Your sister didn't play it either?

352
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,760
No, I was very concerned about her.

353
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I'm not afraid of you.

354
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,760
You ate too much.

355
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Are you hungry?

356
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,760
If you're hungry, you still have...

357
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
...another picture.

358
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Can I have a pack of food?

359
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
They look happy.

360
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,760
I'll remind you to eat more later.

361
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
You're not going to eat?

362
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I'm not old. I like to eat.

363
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm telling you more and more.

364
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,760
After all, my grandmother is not an ordinary person.

365
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
What do you mean?

366
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,760
My grandfather gave up his Hong Kong family business...

367
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
...and came to Nanwu.

368
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,760
He never saw it.

369
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,760
Then he must be a beauty when he was young.

370
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
He's not only beautiful, but also good at studying.

371
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
He's very famous in Hong Kong.

372
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
My grandmother made all the rules in the house.

373
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,760
My grandfather wouldn't even dare to play it.

374
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's go.

375
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Get in the car.

376
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I'll get ready.

377
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Help me turn off the shower.

378
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
Get ready?

379
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
I'm going to get ready.

380
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
How is it?

381
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm so tired.

382
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm so tired.

383
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
I can't do anything.

384
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I need to rest.

385
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
I'll go to the toilet.

386
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
I'm so tired.

387
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm so tired.

388
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm so tired.

389
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm so tired.

390
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I'm so tired.

391
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
I'm so tired.

392
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,760
I'm so tired.

393
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm so tired.

394
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,760
I'm so tired.

395
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm so tired.

396
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
Come in.

397
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
I'll be back.

398
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
I'll be back.

399
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Okay.

400
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm so tired.

401
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I'm so tired.

402
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm so tired.

403
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
I read the post on Weibo

404
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
and I let you show me your friends.

405
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
I said that the new generation is really not loyal.

406
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
I'll cover you up when you come back.

407
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
What?

408
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Xiao Wen.

409
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Xiao Wen.

410
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
I have something for you.

411
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
The big sister you promised to me last time

412
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
was sent here early in the morning.

413
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Is it your relative?

414
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

415
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Bai Qi.

416
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm so fat.

417
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
What do you want for lunch today?

418
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I want to eat some yuanxiang today.

419
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Why don't you go and have some yuanxiang later?

420
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Sure.

421
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Let's go to the restaurant first.

422
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Let's go.

423
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Let's go.

424
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Xiao Wen.

425
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Xiao Wen.

426
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Xiao Wen.

427
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
I have something for you.

428
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Xiao Wen.

429
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I have something for you.

430
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Xiao Wen.

431
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Jiang.

432
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Have you received the red envelope?

433
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Why do you still run around so easily on WeChat red packets?

434
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,760
I'm just used to sending red packets to people.

435
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I always think I can meet you.

436
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Happy New Year.

437
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
What do you want?

438
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Go buy it yourself.

439
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
I don't want to go to the dance.

440
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I want you to be happy soon.

441
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm fine.

442
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Why are you so scared?

443
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Is it the New Year?

444
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I want to be a hope in the New Year.

445
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Do you think so?

446
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I want to take you out for a day.

447
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Where can I go?

448
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Just one day.

449
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
You've taken me to so many places.

450
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Then you take us to play.

451
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I'll take you wherever you want.

452
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Okay.

453
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
I'll see where your mom wants to go.

454
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
You have to make her happy.

455
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Hello, A-Jing.

456
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
I've got the red packet.

457
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
Thank you, mom.

458
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
You're welcome.

459
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm a little bit careless.

460
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Every day...

461
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
If you're free,

462
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
I'll go see you.

463
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Okay, okay.

464
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
I've long wanted to see you.

465
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,760
I'll make you something delicious.

466
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
Then it's a weekend.

467
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
You usually go to work early.

468
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Why don't you come over today?

469
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Are you in such a hurry?

470
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Sister Xin, come here.

471
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
My mom brought more soup.

472
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Let's eat together.

473
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
I'm coming.

474
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Okay, then I'll see you later.

475
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Okay, okay.

476
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I'll wait for you.

477
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
See you at home.

478
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Oh, my god.

479
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Sorry, sister Xin.

481
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
I've come here for our club crossing.

482
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Of course.

483
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,760
Oh, myoken?

484
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Let me see your hairpin.

485
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
Sit down Amazing.

486
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
You want to say hello?

487
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Hello.

488
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Uncle Ma, time to eat.

489
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Coming.

490
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Uncle Ma, sit here.

491
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
He's the old man.

492
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
You sit here.

493
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Come.

494
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
I'll help grandpa.

495
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
Grandpa, I'll help you.

496
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Grandpa, are you happy this time?

497
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,760
I'm happy.

498
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
It's okay.

499
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,760
But you'll bring your wife here today.

500
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
She'll be happy.

501
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Yes, but I'll go to her.

502
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Help me to take this out.

503
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Here's the food.

504
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Lin Ding, you're so hungry today.

505
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Grandpa's cooking is this.

506
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
You're so great.

507
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I'll have dinner tonight.

508
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Okay.

509
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Xiao'ai, introduce yourself.

510
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Grandma, he's Zhong Siqiao.

511
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Zhong Siqiao?

512
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
He's...

513
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
I'm Zhong Siqiao.

514
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
The man with the head of the bridge.

515
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Yes.

516
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
My name is Wang Linlin.

517
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
Yes.

518
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,760
My name is Linlin.

519
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Where's Zhong Siqiao?

520
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,760
He's in Xinjiang.

521
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
He's in Xinjiang.

522
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Yes.

523
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Miss Wang, you're a great cook.

524
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Grandpa, the food you cooked is delicious.

525
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
It's a pity that it's cold.

526
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Let's eat.

527
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Come on.

528
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Grandpa, let's eat.

529
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Come on.

530
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll get the food.

531
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
I'll serve you the food.

532
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
This is white wine.

533
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
I'll get the food.

534
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
Hurry up.

535
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Hurry up.

536
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Don't.

537
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Are you a man of the lake?

538
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Grandpa thinks that

539
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
the man of the lake is very spicy.

540
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
So he added a lot of chili.

541
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
You're a man of the lake.

542
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,760
You should cheer up.

543
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Yes.

544
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Come on.

545
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Let's cheer up.

546
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Come on.

547
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Come on.

548
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Come on.

549
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
Come on.

550
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Come on.

551
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Come on.

552
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Come on.

553
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Come on.

554
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
Come on.

555
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Come on.

556
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
You can leave it.

557
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Otherwise, it's your fault.

558
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Grandma, let me help you wash the car.

559
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
I know how to wash the car.

560
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Let me help you.

561
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
It's not cold.

562
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Can I?

563
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
It's okay.

564
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
These gold planks

565
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
have the function of praying and praying.

566
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
If you drive a car,

567
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
you can write a letter

568
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
or put it on your ear and neck.

569
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
You can write the prayer.

570
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You have this research?

571
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
I use it when I go to work.

572
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
You want me to make a loan?

573
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Why do you have such a hard time?

574
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
I know

575
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
you're not Wang Lingling.

576
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I searched the map once.

577
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
There's no Zhong Siqiao

578
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
near Nanmu.

579
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Zhong Siqiao is not.

580
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
That's your ID.

581
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Grandma,

582
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
you're so smart.

583
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
You're so old and young.

584
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
You don't even tell me the truth.

585
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Grandma, don't be angry.

586
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
It's not bad.

587
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
But there's a good news.

588
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Su Haowan

589
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
broke up with Wang Lingling.

590
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
She asked me to pretend to be your girlfriend.

591
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,760
I just want you to go home and live a happy life.

592
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
I know

593
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
my grandson's thoughts.

594
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I don't blame you.

595
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
But I'm so curious.

596
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
You're such a little girl.

597
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
You can wash the car and put on makeup.

598
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
You're not afraid of the light.

599
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
What kind of job do you have?

600
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
I'm usually

601
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
busy with the work.

602
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm also good at taking notes.

603
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
I talk to people.

604
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I read the medical books.

605
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
You have this kind of job?

606
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Yes.

607
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I have an app.

608
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
There are two cards on it.

609
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
You can download it if you scan it.

610
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
You can find me if you need help.

611
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Okay.

612
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
I'll call my grandson.

613
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
I'll give you a good one.

614
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Thank you.

615
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
I'll go and help you.

616
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
I have a massage chair.

617
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Jian.

618
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
You're here.

619
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
No need to change shoes.

620
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Come in and sit.

621
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Why are you wearing so little?

622
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Is it cold outside?

623
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
This is for you.

624
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I'll stand here.

625
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Let's go inside.

626
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Please sit.

627
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Is it cold outside?

628
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
You're wearing too little.

629
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
I'll get you some water.

630
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
I was afraid of disturbing you

631
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
and not going to see you.

632
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
I haven't seen you in a long time.

633
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
I'm a little excited.

634
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Come on.

635
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Have some water.

636
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Give me some.

637
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Here.

638
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Here.

639
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Look at you.

640
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
You have no meat.

641
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
You didn't eat well, right?

642
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I'll cook whatever you want to eat.

643
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
No need.

644
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm eating well.

645
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
I'm cooking something.

646
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
I know you're coming today.

647
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
I made you soup.

648
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
You've been eating hot soup since you were little.

649
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Today is the 15th.

650
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
You should be a family.

651
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Here.

652
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Eat while it's hot.

653
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
You're so beautiful.

654
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
You're so beautiful.

655
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,760
I didn't see Uncle Zheng

656
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
and Zheng Keqiang.

657
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,760
They took his grandma to their hometown.

658
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
No wonder you're here today.

659
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Xinxin, why are you running?

660
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Why are you running?

661
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Who is he?

662
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
I told you last time

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I wanted to introduce someone to you.

664
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
He is the one I told you about.

665
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
He's your brother.

666
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
He's Zheng Keqiang.

667
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
He's also a sister.

668
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
He's sister Jiang.

669
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
He's also your sister.

670
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Why didn't you tell me?

671
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I didn't tell you.

672
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Listen to my mom.

673
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I'm quite old.

674
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
I used to be a dog.

675
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
Xinxin.

676
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Xinxin.

677
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Who is she?

678
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Isn't she An Xiang?

679
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
We've been together for years.

680
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
I'm so proud of you.

681
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I'm not.

682
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
What's so awkward about her?

683
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
She's not an outsider.

684
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Come on.

685
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm so proud of you.

686
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Look at you.

687
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
You're so ungrateful.

688
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
You've been studying abroad for so many years.

689
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
You didn't come back to see me.

690
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
You're so mean.

691
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Why are you here?

692
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
You're so lucky.

693
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Your grandma just came here for half a year.

694
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Don't be like this.

695
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Jing.

696
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
What are you doing now?

697
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
By the way,

698
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
I had a headache.

699
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
I had a headache.

700
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I had a headache.

701
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Hurry up and get me some medicine.

702
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Okay.

703
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
I'll get you some medicine.

704
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
By the way,

705
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
I'm telling you.

706
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Wenming.

707
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
You're getting married today.

708
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Congratulations.

709
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Congratulations.

710
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
You're so lucky.

711
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
You're so lucky.

712
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
You're still in a bad mood.

713
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
So?

714
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Look.

715
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,760
I've been taking care of you for a long time.

716
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
You're so generous.

717
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
You're not rich either.

718
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Right?

719
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Aunt.

720
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
I've met a rich woman recently.

721
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
She's very old.

722
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
She's two years younger than you.

723
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Look.

724
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
I introduced her to Wenming.

725
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
She's now a rich woman.

726
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
What are you talking about?

727
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
You're the only one who needs to talk to me.

728
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
How could you be so shameless?

729
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
I should have taken care of you.

730
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
What's wrong?

731
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
I'm going to cook for you.

732
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
I won't come to you again.

733
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
This is the last time I've come to you.

734
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
You people...

735
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
don't want to see each other anymore.

736
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
It's my dad.

737
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
He told me before he left.

738
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I need to take good care of you.

739
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,760
I don't have a choice.

740
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Just take it as a way to help my dad.

741
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Don't say that.

742
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Dad is fine.

743
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm fine.

744
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm fine.

745
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Xinxin.

746
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Your dad isn't Xinxin's dad.

747
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
I'm not afraid.

748
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,760
I'm not afraid.

749
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
The last day of the New Year.

750
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Buy more.

751
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
I'll count it.

752
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
The waves are coming.

753
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
It's a little wet.

754
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Thank you.

755
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
It's a little wet.

756
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
It's a little wet.

757
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Yes.

758
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
It's a long way back.

759
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Oh.

760
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Oh.

761
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
It's wet.

762
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Wow.

763
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
It's so cold.

764
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
It's so cold.

765
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
Let's go.

766
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Let's go.

767
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
It's a big smoke.

768
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Yes.

769
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
It's a big smoke.

770
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
It's a big smoke.

771
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Uncle.

772
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,760
Did we find you to sleep?

773
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,760
We'll leave after we finish this.

774
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
What time is it?

775
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Forget it.

776
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
I want to go home.

777
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Okay.

778
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Let's go.

779
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Wait a minute.

780
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
I'll sell the rest of these.

781
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
Really?

782
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I'll give you two North and South.

783
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Okay.

784
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
I'll sell the rest of these.

785
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,760
I'll sell the rest of these.

786
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,760
I'll sell the rest of these.
