1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,960
Angel

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm still a little girl

10
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,800
But if I fall down, I'll be happy

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,800
I just want to cry out for you

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,400
To be happy

13
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,000
But if I stop, I'll be happy

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Sorry

15
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
It's okay

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't run away. Sorry

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
It's okay

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been to many places these days

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
From the south to the north

20
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've been to many places these days

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've been to many places these days

22
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,000
I suddenly found out

23
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Suddenly found out that her world is so beautiful

24
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
I want to be trapped in life

25
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Su Yan

26
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Dianian contacted me today

27
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,200
What did he say

28
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What happened to your words

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't worry

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He just hugged me and said good-bye to me

31
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I really hope he leaves suddenly

32
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just want to fool me

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What do you mean?

34
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Maybe he left our parents' house

35
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
He has been alone for many things

36
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now leave

37
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Just want to be alone

38
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
Sometimes I will be angry at the day he left

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But who would have thought how he came here

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What did he think at that time

41
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now I'm a little angry at myself

42
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't find him to ask clearly

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Did he find out

44
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's looking at a night view

45
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Turns out, Hong Kong

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There is also body colours like south and north

48
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,540
Baby

49
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,340
Cao Hao

50
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,920
What's the matter with him?

51
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,340
Soundie

52
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,540
Hi, Mt. displacement

53
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Hello, broadcaster

54
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Miss Zhang, come in. I'll arrange for you to stay in the hotel

55
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
The view is better

56
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Yifan, come. I'll put the things over there

57
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
You just take care of this. Come in

58
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,100
So many. Wenping, come here. Come here

59
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Didn't I tell you to set up this house before?

60
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
I want to study

61
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,100
This is not a study. You didn't even take it seriously

62
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
You still let me study

63
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
It's okay. I'll clean it myself

64
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Okay, Zhang Jiang, you clean it yourself

65
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Come on, come on

66
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Wenping, come here. I'll come here

67
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I told you to stay in the room. You're tired, right?

68
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Okay, I'll come here. I'll clean it myself

69
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
You should have some respect for your mother

70
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Yes, yes, yes. Don't give me this face

71
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
I'll tell you

72
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,100
This is not a study. You just take care of this

73
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Come here. I'll tell you

74
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
You don't want me to forget

75
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
You said it was a house

76
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
This is a house

77
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
I'll clean it tomorrow

78
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
You should clean it yourself

79
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Okay, okay

80
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
I'll clean it myself

81
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Give me the bowl

82
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Come on

83
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Come on

84
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Give me the bowl

85
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Okay

86
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Wenming is going to study soon

87
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
You should help her to check the room

88
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Sister, I'm just a small-minded person

89
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm not human

90
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
What do you want me to arrange?

91
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
What time is it? You're still angry

92
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Hurry up, come out

93
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Hurry up. What's wrong with the child?

94
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
It's really... Hurry up

95
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
What are you still holding?

96
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Come, you just give me some water

97
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Uncle, I'm sorry to bother you

98
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
You're welcome. Just treat it as your own house

99
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Sit down and eat

100
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Changbin, take the stool

101
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Thank you

102
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
You just take the stool. You don't know how much it is

103
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
What are you doing? Go

104
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Come

105
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Uncle

106
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,100
You just go there. She's fine. She's still working

107
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Maybe she's still a little bit of a liar

108
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Don't talk nonsense

109
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
What are you looking at?

110
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh, right. If you have any questions about her in school

111
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
You can ask her

112
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,100
But don't bother her too much

113
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Do you hear me?

114
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Eat, eat, eat. It's getting cold

115
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Thank you

116
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
I'm not going to sleep. I'm going to talk to you

117
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Go. Go

118
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Go

119
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Uncle

120
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Doctor, sorry

121
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I didn't bother you

122
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,180
Dad, I haven't seen you come to the office.

123
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,700
Can you do this?

124
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,740
Since we are moving, we are family.

125
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,100
You are welcome.

126
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,820
Dad.

127
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,540
I'm busy now.

128
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,220
I have to go to the office.

129
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,260
Okay, I'll be there in a few days.

130
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,980
I'll stay here.

131
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,660
If there's anything,

132
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,580
come to me in the office.

133
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,300
Okay?

134
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,220
Okay.

135
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,780
Go to bed early.

136
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,220
Bye.

137
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,100
Big sister comes back.

138
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,460
ung.

139
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,620
So late.

140
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,340
You...

141
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,140
Actually,

142
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,900
you know everything.

143
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
I'm going to the bathroom.

144
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
I'll take a look at the workshop.

145
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
I'm going to sleep now.

146
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
I'm going to the bathroom.

147
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Why are you here?

148
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
There's no place to dance.

149
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I'll just leave it here.

150
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
Thank you.

151
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,900
I'll say a few words.

152
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
We're going to the college entrance exam soon.

153
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,900
The academic report is also very important.

154
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,900
We must take into account the annual report information.

155
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Find your favorite university and professional

156
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
and look for the target to work hard.

157
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,900
If you don't understand, you can ask the teacher

158
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
or talk to the family more.

159
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Do you understand?

160
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Yes.

161
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Okay, continue.

162
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
I must take the exam.

163
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I want you to take the exam.

164
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Then we'll make a promise.

165
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Work hard together.

166
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
Take the exam together.

167
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
I want to go back to Nanmu.

168
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I'll go back with you this time.

169
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I'll go to you tomorrow.

170
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
I'll go back to Nanmu soon.

171
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Don't come over.

172
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
When?

173
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,900
When the entrance report is sent.

174
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
It's already July.

175
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Then you run away all the time.

176
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
How troublesome.

177
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
How troublesome.

178
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
How about this?

179
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
When the entrance report is sent,

180
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
I'll go there.

181
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Okay.

182
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Good night.

183
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Let's go.

184
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Let's go.

185
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Let's go.

186
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Jiang.

187
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Is there anything?

188
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Can you come out and help me?

189
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
What's wrong?

190
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Your uncle called me.

191
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
He said the material on the tank is used.

192
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Then I asked someone to send it to me.

193
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Then I helped him.

194
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
What's the condition?

195
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
The powder.

196
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
There's only paper in here.

197
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Look up there.

198
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
They put the boxes in the wrong place.

199
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,900
Okay.

200
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
This one is the most important.

201
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
What are you doing?

202
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
It's okay.

203
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Let's find the box.

204
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
You go down.

205
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
What are you doing?

206
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Help me find it.

207
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
What are you doing?

208
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
What are you doing?

209
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
Sister, sister.

210
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
You're back so early.

211
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
You didn't go out.

212
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Uncle.

213
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Uncle.

214
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Jiang.

215
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Go back to your room and rest.

216
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Go.

217
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Go.

218
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Well,

219
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Sheng Jiang, listen to her mother.

220
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Go back to your room and rest.

221
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Look,

222
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
we're busy with business these days.

223
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
We often don't get married.

224
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
You have to listen to your uncle.

225
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay.

226
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Go back to your room.

227
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Go.

228
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Drink some water.

229
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,900
Go back.

230
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Thank you, Jiang.

231
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Thank you.

232
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
Then,

233
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
I'll go.

234
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
What's this?

235
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Okay, okay.

236
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
You go to rest.

237
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
What can I say?

238
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Every girl

239
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
is not awake for the next 10,000 years.

240
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
If you can't do it,

241
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
you can talk about it later.

242
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,900
But I'm really scared.

243
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
I beg you,

244
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
please take me back.

245
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
I'm really scared.

246
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
I beg you.

247
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Don't cry.

248
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Tell your mother.

249
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
She will talk to your uncle.

250
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Don't worry.

251
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
I'll hang up.

252
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Okay, guys.

253
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Class is over.

254
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Go back and rest.

255
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Come to the toilet again tomorrow.

256
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Hey, student.

257
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
It's time to finish the late night.

258
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Go home.

259
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Go back and rest.

260
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm going to the toilet.

261
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

262
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

263
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

264
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

265
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

266
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

267
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

268
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

269
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

270
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

271
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

272
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

273
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

274
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

275
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
I'll go back to the water.

276
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Besides,

277
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
I'm not wearing comfortable tops.

278
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
I'm putting on special attacker shoes.

279
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Don't worry.

280
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
I've brought aEDK and incisor on them.

281
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
I'll go back to the toilet.

282
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
If there are technical substances,

283
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Hot water is not necessary.

284
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
They have to come at the bolt.

285
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,900
If there are provide food options,

286
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
Hot water is OK.

287
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Then you come to the toilet.

288
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,980
You will give others your trust.

289
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,880
Mom, I fought with him somewhere.

290
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,120
Let number be announced, others can all wait.

291
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
What?

292
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
What did you do to him?

293
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
You know what?

294
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
You're so heartless.

295
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
What are you doing?

296
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Come here.

297
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Don't touch me!

298
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
I'll kill you!

299
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Yifan!

300
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
Yifan!

301
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Yifan!

302
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
What's wrong with you?

303
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
What's wrong with you?

304
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Yifan!

305
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Yifan!

306
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Look at your daughter.

308
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
I've been so hard to take her with me.

309
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
She's living here.

310
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
What's the result?

311
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
The result is...

312
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,120
She wants to send my brother to prison.

313
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I'm sorry. Don't be angry.

314
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
What do you mean?

315
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I didn't say anything.

316
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,120
She just left the room drunk.

317
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,120
She's so cruel.

318
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
She didn't do anything.

319
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
She even broke her leg.

320
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,120
She even locked you up.

321
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
She's so heartless.

322
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Don't be angry.

323
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I'm so heartless.

324
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I'll go talk to her.

325
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
Jian.

326
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Did you get the situation wrong?

327
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Your aunt's brother is a good person.

328
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
He wouldn't do such a thing.

329
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Don't make a scene.

330
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
You know too much.

331
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
You have to make a scene.

332
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Make a scene outside.

333
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
No.

334
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Are you okay?

335
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I can go back to the security bureau.

336
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
It's quiet there.

337
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Let's make a conclusion.

338
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Go.

339
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Tell your aunt

340
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
everything in the situation.

341
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
The guards can stay with you.

342
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Come with me.

343
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I...

344
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I have to go.

345
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
The driver of the car sent me here.

346
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Mom.

347
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I'm begging you.

348
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I'm begging you.

349
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm begging you.

350
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm begging you.

351
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Don't make a scene.

352
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I'll go first.

353
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
I'm leaving.

354
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm leaving.

355
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Are you hurt?

356
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Be careful.

357
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Mom.

358
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
The rain is falling.

359
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
It seems that the body is getting deeper.

360
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
No matter where I go,

361
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
I still can't get out of that rain.

362
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm leaving.

363
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I'm sorry.

364
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Ding Ding.

365
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Ding Ding.

366
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
Is it Ding Ding?

367
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Hello, Xiang.

369
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Xiang.

370
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Are you busy?

371
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
No.

372
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
I couldn't go back this spring.

373
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
It's a pity.

374
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,120
We can't go to the third corner.

375
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
How is it?

376
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
How are you and Ding Ding?

377
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
What's wrong?

378
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Did something happen to Ding Ding?

379
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
She left her house.

380
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I think I saw Ding Ding.

381
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Where is she?

382
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
Hello, Guan Ling.

383
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120

Hello, Guan Ling.

Are you having dinner?

389

You're thinking about her, too, right?

390
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
You're thinking about her, too, right?

408
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,100

409
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,120
makes you think you can do this.

410
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,120
I'll show you my hatred

411
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
You'll go cold

413
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Your heart is cold

414
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
One more

415
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,120
The one who is sincere

416
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Tears are reflected in my eyes

417
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm the only one left in your soft world

418
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120

Why are you here?

00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Don't be a loser. I'll ask you for help

422
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
You're not tired?

423
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
No

424
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Have a chat

425
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,280
Let's do it again.

426
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
You can do it.

00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,120
No questions!

429
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,000
Create the debate.

430
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,480
No need!

431
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,720
Come down and chat.

432
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,280
Haven't met you in a while.

433
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,920
What's Washington about?

434
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920

438
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,760
Thank you.

00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,780
That's perfect.

440
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,880
The來了ansе guest

441
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,400
There's no wine, I'll go drink first.

442
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,600
Thanks. I have to go.

443
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,280
It's alright, don't walk壞 the wine.

444
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,240
Give him a glass of wine, and then I'll drink it.

445
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,320
Hold me.

446
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,400
No need for that.

447
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,560
Where are you going?

448
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,000
Are you okay?

449
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
I'm fine.

450
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,760
What's wrong?

451
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
That man's line.

452
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,800
That woman's not drunk.

453
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,400
Then the old man took her away.

454
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,400
I'm fine.

455
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,480
It's okay.

456
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
Oh,

457
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,680
Chief times,

458
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,160
you did great

459
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,800
to get into her shoes.

460
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
I promise you.

461
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,920
Chief!

462
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,360
Chief!

463
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,920
Give us some water!

464
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,840
I'm going to die!

465
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,760
Okay, okay, okay.

466
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay, okay, okay.

467
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay, okay.

468
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm going to die.

469
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm asking you if you're unhappy with your little daughter.

470
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm not a man anymore.

471
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
You should be able to understand me.

472
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Are you a woman?

473
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,960
I almost hurt myself.

474
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
How about I share a chicken with you?

475
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,960
I don't need you.

476
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
What's wrong?

477
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
How could you do this to me?

478
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Brother Chun! Brother He!

479
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Brother Yan is here!

480
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Boss.

481
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
How are you?

482
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm going to call the ambulance.

483
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
What's wrong?

484
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I'm going to call the ambulance.

485
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Call the ambulance.

486
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Call me!

487
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,000
You're not in a hurry.

488
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
What are you doing?

489
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
