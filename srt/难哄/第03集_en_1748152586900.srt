1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
I was able to settings you to blame.

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,880
OK, point them out.

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,220
Ok.

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,400
Why have you stopped?

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
The air jak 빛.

21
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Ok, people rest in peace.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
What is going on?

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,660
What is going on there?

24
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,680
Who was that?

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,480
You are sick, aren't you?

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,200
What did you talk about?

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,240
Why did you push me?

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
What did you do?

29
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm not going to do that.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I'll just go home.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
What are you doing?

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm going to kill Ming.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
It's okay.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Okay, okay.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Don't make trouble.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
The movie is not coming back.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Let's go back first.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Why are you angry?

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Okay, okay.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
What are you looking at?

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Let's go.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's go.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Are you looking at Yue Liang?

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Yes.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm looking at Ming.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
He's your Bai Yue Guo.

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I have been thinking.

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm behind you.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I have been thinking about your wife.

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I think...

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Miss.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,960
Bai Dian.

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,320
What are you looking at?

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,840
Moonlight.

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
Listen.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,480
Su Hao said it all.

57
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,160
Can I?

58
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
You provide the breakfast company.

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,680
I have a good news.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,760
I should drink in the world of medicine.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,480
What do you think?

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Do you want to hear it?

63
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,300
Open it up

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,020
Linjie

65
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,960
Xiaofan

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,240
What's wrong with you?

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Why do I feel so Bathed

68
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,960
I have something to avoid in the house

69
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Sorry, Linjie

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,480
I caused trouble to you

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,800
It's fine

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
I sut-set you in

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Xiao Fan, I forgot to tell you.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,760
You can't have a cat. I can't have a cat.

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Then I can put it in the room.

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Can I put it in the room?

77
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Don't worry, it won't run around.

78
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
It will run around.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,760
The door, the air, the air is all flowing.

80
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,760
The door is all blown out.

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Forget it.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
It's like this today.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,760
You can put it in your friend's house tomorrow.

84
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

85
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Why didn't you come back?

86
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I saw Sang Yan. I asked him to come back.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,760
You asked him to bring you back?

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,760
He didn't say he was here.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
He doesn't need to be the boss.

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Don't be like this next time.

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
He is so happy now.

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,760
Maybe he is still having a fight with his friend.

93
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Look, he never chased you.

94
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,760
And now you are trying to trick him.

95
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
He must think you are playing with him.

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Then he will tell you.

97
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
All the tools are a trick.

98
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
I understand.

100
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I put it on the refrigerator.

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Remember to look at it.

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Good night.

103
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Good night, Sister Lin.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
I am going to take this.

105
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
It's been a long time, right?

106
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
I want to give you a gift.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Thank you.

108
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Here is the gift.

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Get in the car.

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
I found a car.

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
I found a car.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I found a car.

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
I found a car.

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
I found a car.

115
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,760
I found a car.

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I found a car.

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I found a car.

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Sister Qiao Qiao is going to listen to me.

119
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Don't worry.

120
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
I will make her fat.

121
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Okay, I won't eat.

122
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Okay, I won't eat.

123
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Here.

124
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Her toys.

125
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I will tell you everything.

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Call me if you need anything.

127
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I am not your boyfriend.

128
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
I will go to see what she has.

129
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
Qiao Qiao.

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Qiao Qiao.

131
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Don't look at me.

132
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
But we have already said that we will eat together.

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
You are good.

134
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
I am good too.

135
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
We will break up.

136
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
I bought all the bags you wanted.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,760
I bought all the bags you wanted.

138
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't like your bags.

139
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Take them away.

140
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,760
I am giving them to you.

141
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
I will give them to you.

142
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
Okay.

143
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I will sell them to you.

144
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
I will sell them to you.

145
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
I will give them to you now.

146
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Don't ask me to give you half of the money.

147
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Xiao Fan.

148
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Xiao Fan.

149
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Sister Lin.

150
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I have some bags to pack.

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I will give you the delivery.

152
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,760
I will give you the address.

153
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Can you send them to me?

154
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I can.

155
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Xiao Fan.

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
Sister Lin.

157
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I can help you to pack.

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
You can take the order on your phone.

159
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Really?

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Yes.

161
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
I can help you to pack.

162
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
I will send them to you tonight.

163
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Thank you, Meini.

164
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
You can send them to the delivery.

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
It's almost the same.

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Is this address?

167
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Yes.

168
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Okay.

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay.

170
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Thank you.

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I will pack them for you.

172
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Come on.

173
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Come on.

174
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Hello.

175
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Hello.

176
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Sister Lin.

177
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Your boyfriend.

178
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Your ex-boyfriend is here.

179
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Li Li.

180
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
Don't move.

181
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Don't come here.

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
We are not boyfriend and girlfriend.

183
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I don't care about these bags.

184
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I really care about our relationship.

185
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't care about these bags either.

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
I really want to take them.

187
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I will return them to you.

188
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
But we are having a happy meal together.

189
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Do you know what it means to have a happy meal?

190
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
Beauty.

191
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Coming.

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
These bags.

193
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
These two bags.

194
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Okay.

195
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Put them in the delivery.

196
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
This one.

197
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Okay.

198
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Please give me a ticket.

199
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Sorry.

200
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Please give me a ticket.

201
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
This order is complete.

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I don't know.

203
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,760
I don't know.

204
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Do you know why I bought bags?

205
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I bought clothes.

206
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I bought you everything.

207
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Because you have the ability to buy bags.

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
I have the condition to pack them.

209
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
In the process of pursuing them,

210
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,760
this is a kind of behavior that is a kind of fraud.

211
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
That's because I love you.

212
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Love this word.

213
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Of course, you can't calculate it with the money.

214
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
But because I love you,

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
this bag is the value of the product.

216
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Then I don't love you anymore.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Is it that these bags have no value?

218
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Take it away.

219
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I'm begging you.

220
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Okay?

221
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Well,

222
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
I can actually deliver it to the door.

223
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
I can actually deliver it to the door.

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,760
1748.

225
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Okay, thank you.

226
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
You lost these bags, right?

227
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Please give me a hand.

228
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
30, right?

229
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
I heard that Wang Lingying is going to resign.

230
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
It seems that she has taken a big client of the advertising department.

231
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
No wonder she wants to hire you.

232
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Last time, I saw the car from the security department

233
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
and became a Ferrari.

234
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
I also want to drive a Ferrari.

235
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Your decoding technique is too weak.

236
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,760
I'm not going to listen to you.

237
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
We three are not a group of ordinary people.

238
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
You can't listen to anything.

239
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,760
You two can't ignore me.

240
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Stop.

241
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Why do you rely on men?

242
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
It's best to rely on yourself.

243
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Are you stupid?

244
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
You're pregnant and you're still breaking up with your family.

245
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Before you break up,

246
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,760
do you have to be a little bit more cautious?

247
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm talking about her.

248
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
Why are you so annoying with me?

249
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Teacher, do you have to leave everything to me?

250
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
I'm doing this for your own good.

251
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
You see, you have time.

253
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I'll send it to you.

254
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm thinking about it.

255
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
What if you say that the child is born?

256
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
Do you need to raise money?

257
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you need to be so big?

258
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
It's a big deal.

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
It's a big deal.

260
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm telling you.

261
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm a girl with a personal and independent thinking.

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Don't be so mean.

263
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I told you that I've been in love for a year.

264
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,760
You've been out for a year.

265
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Senior,

266
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
do you know why you're single now?

267
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,760
It's because you two are childish.

268
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
How do you know I'm single?

269
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm still in touch with her.

270
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Maybe we'll get married every day.

271
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
What are you doing?

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
You didn't stay here on purpose, did you?

273
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
In the same way,

274
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
I suggest you not to use it again.

275
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Why don't you give it back to me?

276
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I want to borrow some money to pay for it.

277
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm a dead man.

278
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
It's in your hand.

279
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,760
You can see when I'll find you when you're free.

280
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
I'll give you some trouble.

281
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
You can leave.

282
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,760
I'll be back.

283
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Do you have time to eat dinner with me tonight?

284
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
I do.

285
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Me too.

286
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
Where shall we eat?

287
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
I'll be back.

288
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Do you have time to work?

289
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Well,

290
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
do you have time to work or to eat?

291
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
After a long time,

292
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
you have time to work?

293
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
It looks like

294
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I don't eat this meal.

295
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Thank you.

296
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I'll leave you alone.

297
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
My colleague is waiting for me.

298
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Sorry to trouble you so many times.

299
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
You can see when you're free.

300
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
I'll treat you to dinner.

301
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
I'll be free anytime.

302
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,760
How many times do you have to say that?

303
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
If you don't agree,

304
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,760
you'll be fired.

305
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Since you want to ask,

306
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
what do you want to eat tomorrow?

307
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Anything.

308
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Do you have any appetite?

309
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I have a lot.

310
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Hot pot?

311
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Hot pot?

312
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Meat?

313
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Smell?

314
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Food?

315
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Then,

316
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,760
I can eat whatever you want.

317
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
I don't have any appetite.

318
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,760
Anything.

319
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Your home is on fire.

320
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
You're out.

321
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
You're talking about people?

322
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
It's not your home.

323
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
It's your house downstairs.

324
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
You're out.

325
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Do you know how big the fire is?

326
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Your house is burning.

327
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Come back and stand up.

328
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Okay.

329
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Please give me a drink.

330
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Thank you.

331
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
Your house is on fire.

332
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Don't you want to go back and have a look?

333
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm not a firefighter.

334
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I can't help you.

335
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I'll go back.

336
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Can you ask me

337
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
where your house is?

338
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I want to go to the report.

339
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Can you tell me

340
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
the specific details?

341
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Hello, Yifan.

342
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm looking for you.

343
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,760
The fire is at the center of the world.

344
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I'll go back now.

345
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Wait for me there.

346
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
See you later.

347
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
The center of the world.

348
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Yes.

349
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
The center of the world.

350
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Okay.

351
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
See you later.

352
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Yifan's high school students,

353
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
don't worry too much.

354
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
Our report

355
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
will be fully objective.

356
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I'll help you.

357
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
I'll help you.

358
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I think this is the place.

359
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Hello, police officer.

360
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I want to ask

361
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
where is the victims' house?

362
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
Here.

363
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
The two of you?

364
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes.

365
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
Okay, thank you.

366
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Come here.

367
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
You go to the interview room first.

368
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Help the staff.

369
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Don't disturb the staff.

370
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Hello.

371
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Are you living in this house?

372
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Yes.

373
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
We are the reporters of the TV station.

374
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Can I have a interview with you?

375
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Sure.

376
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Please come to the fifth floor.

377
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
We'll sit on the 7th floor.

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
I heard a loud noise outside.

379
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I thought

380
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,760
I was putting fireworks everywhere.

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
It's said that a housekeeper

382
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
from the 8th floor

383
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
will charge the electric car.

384
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
The fire is at the center of the world.

385
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
He will rush to the 9th floor directly from the 8th floor.

386
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
The housekeeper from the 9th floor

387
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
is so unlucky.

388
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
I have a question.

389
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Is the housekeeper of the 9th floor at the scene?

390
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
What do you want to eat?

391
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
It seems to be a handsome man.

392
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
Is he in the town?

393
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
It's him.

394
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
Yes.

395
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
I see.

396
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Thank you.

397
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Hello.

398
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Excuse me.

399
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Are you the housekeeper of the 9th floor?

400
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Yes.

401
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm sorry.

402
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I heard that

403
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
the most serious situation

404
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
of the fire is at your house, right?

405
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
What do you want?

406
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Do you have a request?

407
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
The interview will help you.

408
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
I mean

409
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
there is no precious material in the house.

410
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
So it's good.

411
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,760
Do you have any requests?

412
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
No.

413
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Come on.

414
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Wait.

415
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I know your heart.

416
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,760
After all, it's fire.

417
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
I'm going to Ren'an Le

418
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,760
to ask you to be careful

419
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
about the fire in the electric car.

420
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,760
What do you want to say?

421
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm very happy.

422
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,760
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

423
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
What's wrong?

424
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
I'm worried.

425
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Hello.

426
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
We are the reporters of the Southwood Electric Car.

427
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
I heard that the most serious

428
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
disaster in the fire is at your house, right?

429
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
What do you want?

430
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
I mean

431
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
there is no precious material in the house.

432
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
So it's good.

433
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
Do you have any requests?

434
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm very happy.

435
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

436
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Yifan.

437
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
You are so talented.

438
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
You are so calm.

439
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,760
You can't be so calm.

440
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
You can be at ease.

441
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
Let him talk about

442
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
the compensation

443
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
with Wu Ye and my insurance company.

444
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Don't be sad.

445
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
He doesn't seem to be sad.

446
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
How did he think?

447
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
How do you know?

448
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm sorry, sister.

449
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Teacher Qian asked me to go.

450
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
I'll go first.

451
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
I'll go first.

452
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Good morning, Sister Aotian.

453
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Morning.

454
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,760
You are up so early.

455
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
No, I just came back.

456
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I was tired for a whole night.

457
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
I'm tired.

458
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Do you have to work together today?

459
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
You want me to die?

460
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
I always mention work.

461
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
So you are not going to work today?

462
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
I'm not going to.

463
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Don't you think it's very tiring

464
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
to work every day?

465
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm fine.

466
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
You are like this.

467
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Xiao Fan.

468
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Come here.

469
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,760
I have something to tell you.

470
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
You promised me

471
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
you would never be angry.

472
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I just said

473
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
that it's really tiring

474
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
to work now.

475
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
It's not enough to make

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
a month's salary

477
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
for me to buy a bag.

478
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
It's really my limit

479
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
to work until now.

480
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm going to resign today.

481
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
My cousin said

482
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
he introduced me a new job

483
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
at the top of the class.

484
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
That's right.

485
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
I'm not kidding.

486
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I'm not kidding.

487
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
I'm not kidding.

488
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Xiao Fan.

489
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Are you angry?

490
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Isn't this place a little far away?

491
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
So you're not going to live here?

492
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
I don't know

493
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
where I live.

494
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
If I can live here,

495
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I will definitely live here.

496
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
I will find you

497
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
a very reliable new employee.

498
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
No.

499
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
I just moved here.

500
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
You are leaving.

501
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,760
How can I bear to

502
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
bear this rent alone?

503
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I don't want the rent of the house.

504
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
It's the first month's rent.

505
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
You can live here

506
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
with a safe life.

507
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
You have a wife, right?

508
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
I will definitely ask

509
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
your opinion before I find it.

510
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,760
If you don't agree,

511
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
I will definitely

512
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
not let him do this for this family.

513
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
That's awesome!

514
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
Little girl.

515
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
You're amazing.

516
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
You've got into trouble here.

517
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
Did I do it?

518
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,120
The security bureau has recorded it.

519
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,400
You can go and check it.

520
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,880
It's been a year.

521
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
I can't rent a house here.

522
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,000
Who's paying for this?

523
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,400
Our TV station is very interested in the safety of rent.

524
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
If it weren't for my support,

525
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
your house would be in the news.

526
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,360
Or do you want your house to be in the news?

527
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
auge's a little bit to a good note.

528
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
I'll go first.

529
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,040
The Amanda police incident last fall

530
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Tonight I'm here

531
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,240
I have to be present

532
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,840
What happened?

533
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,880
TheWak customers are still not here

534
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,880
Did not they say,

535
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
I knocked by theím

536
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,440
I want to join Begonia

537
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
What's the matter?

538
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,320
I need to call the police

539
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,160
It's urgent

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Anybodyfoaaaa !

541
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,320
I also need some patients

542
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,320
I'm sorry.

543
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,280
I was wrong.

544
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,520
I'm sorry.

545
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,560
It's safe now.

546
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,600
I'm sorry.

547
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,200
Why are you here?

548
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I want to ask

549
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,360
why you are here.

550
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
Why am I here at my house?

551
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Hello, Sister Lin.

552
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Who is it?

553
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm already asleep.

554
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I'm asking Yifan.

555
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
What's the matter?

556
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Tell me.

557
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I want to ask you something.

558
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Did you give the key to someone else?

559
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Yes, Sang Yan.

560
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I just...

561
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I didn't find anyone to help me.

562
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
If you have to take it to the next month,

563
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
you have to pay all the rent.

564
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
I'm worried for you.

565
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Really?

566
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Yes.

567
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Thank you, brother.

568
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Su Haolan, are you sick?

569
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
You live with a girl for the first time.

570
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Is the fire so big?

571
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Are you out of your mind?

572
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Or are you out of your mind?

573
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
She is your daughter.

574
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm with her in the old age.

575
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Is that appropriate?

576
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
Let's make a deal.

577
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Find a girl for me, Sister Lin.

578
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
What kind of girl is she?

579
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You asked me to help you find a house.

580
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Then I'll ask you what's your condition.

581
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Didn't you say you were close to the top?

582
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Is it because you two have a brotherhood?

583
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
No.

584
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Can you tell me

585
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
about your girlfriend first?

586
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Tell her first.

587
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
We have a plan.

588
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
You just hugged my little head.

589
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
We have a deal.

590
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Find a girl for me, Sister Lin.

591
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Xiao Fan,

592
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
let's talk about it tomorrow morning.

593
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Okay?

594
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I really have to sleep.

595
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Hello?

596
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Go to sleep.

597
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Yes.

598
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I am coming.

599
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Let's go.

600
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Okay.

601
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Okay.

602
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Bye.

603
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
No.

604
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Bye.

605
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Bye.

606
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Bye.

607
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Bye.

608
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Bye.

609
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Bye.

610
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Let's make a deal.

611
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay.

612
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,680
I want to eat at home.

613
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,000
Come in.

614
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
I suggest this place.

615
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,680
Open.

616
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm free tomorrow.

617
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,520
Steven.

618
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,240
Steven is going for surgery.

619
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,480
Can we really46

620
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,680
I didn't know.

621
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,480
I just want to be a part of your family.

622
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,080
You can't ask me to marry you.

623
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm not a part of your family.

624
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm just a part of your family.

625
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Then choose a suitable one. I'll pay.

626
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,480
Just find a house as soon as possible.

627
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,880
You're so good at writing.

628
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
A person like you should not be used to this kind of cooperation.

629
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,080
Let's not expand the mistakes.

630
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,280
When the time comes, move things and get more trouble.

631
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,080
How do you know I don't like it?

632
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,680
You've used all your money to make a living. How much more money do you need?

633
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,880
Don't you have a restaurant?

634
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
To be honest,

635
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
I don't have much money.

636
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm not very good at writing.

637
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,080
I often work overtime.

638
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,480
I'm afraid that I might affect your rest.

639
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Then I hope that you can work overtime and be more quiet.

640
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,680
I have a cat.

641
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
What's wrong with the cat?

642
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
The cat is also a cat. It's also a mess.

643
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,080
And it's a stray cat.

644
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,880
It's like a cat. I'm afraid that it'll catch you.

645
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,880
Don't you like cats?

646
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
I do.

647
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,280
I said we're not suitable.

648
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
It's not suitable to live together.

649
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
We're all one-hearted.

650
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
It's not convenient for you to live together.

651
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,280
You probably don't want to go home.

652
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,880
You also want to do something.

653
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,080
You don't want to think about anything.

654
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,680
You don't want to think about things.

655
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,080
Then think about three more things.

656
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Wei Yifan.

657
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
You know what I mean?

658
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,880
What do you mean?

659
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,280
Do you still think that I'm not forgetful to you?

660
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,880
And you still think that I'm like what I used to be?

661
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,080
I don't mean that.

662
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,680
So I'm so strong in your heart.

663
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680
You're wrong.

664
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,080
Anyway, I've moved the luggage.

665
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,880
I can still hold it.

666
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,480
Three months.

667
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,280
Wait for the house to be installed.

668
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I'll move it immediately.

669
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,480
Isn't this just one luggage?

670
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,880
Don't ask me to stay in the three months.

671
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,480
Don't run into me.

672
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,880
Okay, don't find so many excuses.

673
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm sorry.

674
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,900
Are you okay?

675
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Did the office case make a mistake?

676
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,680
Everyone free...

677
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,580
is you.

678
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,780
Impossible.

679
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,280
I'm afraid that I'm not going to give you your thoughts.

680
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
How about...

681
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,800
I said it. I understand.

682
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,720
How about staying here tonight?

683
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,400
We'll think about it.

684
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,080
We'll talk about it after I get off work tomorrow.

685
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,520
When are you going to work?

686
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,200
Before 8 p.m.

687
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Okay.

688
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,600
How about you sleep with me tonight?

689
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,380
What the...

690
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,220
Didn't mean to talk nonsense in front of me.

691
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,100
I meant you could stay at the bedroom.

692
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,400
Yes.

693
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,280
It's一直 nationals everywhere in the countryside.

694
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,300
It'll intensify your deal when you see this.

695
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
稍微盯一下

696
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,640
The bedst foretie whose cutting tablestool got damaged

697
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,160
Need help for a GWED

698
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,580
I tried a rechtay

699
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,240
Ooh ye-

700
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,940
l'll take it

701
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,240
What's your total?

702
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,200
It's both

703
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,140
THINK

704
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,220
So beautiful.

705
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,900
Thank you.

706
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,900
've been rude to me just now.

707
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,820
You're happy to see Song Yan clean up her hair.

708
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,020
Jiang Kejie.

709
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm staying here.

710
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,980
My eyes are such a shock.

711
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,340
Oh, yes!

712
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm okay.

713
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
But I really want to seemedog

714
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,820
You really wanna make me go to the despondency

715
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,060
Your father said

716
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,460
I should go work

717
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,340
Lend me your house

718
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,380
Why would he leave all keys

719
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Xiao Fan.

720
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,140
It's been a long time.

721
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,620
Have you ordered?

722
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,660
I ordered it for you.

723
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,020
Their cookies are very delicious.

724
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,620
Lin.

725
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,220
Yu.

726
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,700
Yu.

727
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,300
Let's talk about the problem of the new roommate.

728
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,700
I don't understand.

729
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
What's wrong with the cooperation with Sang Yan?

730
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,660
I said I don't want girls.

731
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,380
Is the difference between men and women so big?

732
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,620
How did you tell me that?

733
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,300
Did you think she liked you

734
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,140
because of a white moon?

735
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,420
Put your heart in your stomach.

736
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,060
I've heard from Song Haowan.

737
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,180
Sang Yan never taught a girlfriend in college for four years.

738
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,060
He always had a school grass with a broken family.

739
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,580
Isn't it related to this thing

740
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,260
to talk about the new roommate?

741
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,860
I just want to tell you.

742
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,820
There are many benefits to cooperation with men.

743
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,820
He can help you get a physical support.

744
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,420
He will give you more money.

745
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,580
If you use his stuff,

746
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,420
he won't tell you.

747
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,780
I don't need to.

748
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,780
I had a boyfriend before.

749
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,900
He was a developer from the cooperation.

750
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,500
Even if it's not Sang Yan,

751
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,820
you should find a man.

752
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,100
Maybe.

753
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,340
He's a big deal.

754
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,540
Then the advertising department

755
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,700
to open the legal force customer

756
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,300
knows your new roommate.

757
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,940
He knows that you are

758
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,260
a man who opens a insurance company

759
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,100
to sell hot springs.

760
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,900
He also introduced you to the cousin.

761
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,740
They are all familiar.

762
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,500
They are all your cousin.

763
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,780
What do you mean?

764
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,380
It's none of your business.

765
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,460
Since you have a good relationship with Sang Yan,

766
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,660
you should live with him.

767
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,380
There are more cousin than you.

768
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,100
That's good, Wei Yifan.

769
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,180
I didn't expect you to be so stressed.

770
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm done.

771
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,820
You can light the fridge.

772
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,860
You are so nervous.

773
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,220
If you have a cat,

774
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,580
what cat?

775
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,020
What cat?

776
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,380
Is he young?

777
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,620
Show me your photo.

778
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,500
His friend is empty.

779
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
He doesn't have a photo.

780
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,820
Is he a man?

781
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,300
Not really.

782
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,620
And he doesn't have a certain

783
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,620
life.

784
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,020
Then try to fight.

785
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,540
If you are not bad,

786
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,060
at least you should protect him.

787
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,460
He must be a bad guy.

788
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,260
At least,

789
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,460
he always respects me

790
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,140
before I promised him.

791
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,580
Where are we going today?

792
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,460
Are we going to a place

793
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,820
or a house?

794
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,100
I'm going to the house.

795
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
I'm going to the house.

796
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm going to the house.

797
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,700
I'm going to the house.

798
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,740
I'm going to the house.

799
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,940
I'm going to the house.

800
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm going to the house.

801
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,260
I'm going to the house.

802
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
I'm going to the house.

803
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,340
I'm going to the house.

804
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I'm going to the house.

805
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
I'm going to the house.

806
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm going to the house.

807
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
I'm going to the house.

808
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
I'm going to the house.

809
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
I'm going to the house.

810
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
I'm going to the house.

811
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
I'm going to the house.

812
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
I'm going to the house.

813
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
I'm going to the house.

814
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
I'm going to the house.

815
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
I'm going to the house.

816
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm going to the house.

817
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,340
I'm going to the house.

818
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,500
Could you open the door?

819
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,460
Yes.

820
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,700
Then you'll see.

821
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,780
I'm going to the house.

822
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm going to the house.

823
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I'm going to the house.

824
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
Is it me?

825
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,100
The door is not locked.

826
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,820
Why didn't you bring the key yesterday?

827
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
I saw you didn't sleep in the room.

828
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
Where did you sleep?

829
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
The hotel.

830
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,300
Five stars.

831
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,900
How much is it?

832
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,300
Aren't you going to play it?

833
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Play it.

834
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Have you thought about it?

835
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Have you?

836
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
I...

837
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,100
I agree to move in.

838
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,300
Actually, I don't have that high a request for my roommate.

839
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,820
I just have no problem with the product.

840
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,100
I can just let it go.

841
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
I'll do it.

842
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
You don't have to worry about it.

843
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,900
I don't have any worries.

844
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,700
I don't have any worries about you.

845
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I don't have any worries about you.

846
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,580
Just talk about details.

847
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,300
For example?

848
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,300
Before Lin Jie left,

849
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,700
she left me her WeChat account.

850
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,460
This house is her name.

851
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,660
It's still in the 7th.

852
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
I see.

853
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,500
And this house is 7,000 yuan per month.

854
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,220
If you live in the main house,

855
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
the room is bigger.

856
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,620
And the private bathroom.

857
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,020
Is it okay to pay 4,000 yuan?

858
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,220
It's reasonable.

859
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,460
It's reasonable.

860
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
It's reasonable.

861
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,660
And then the deposit.

862
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,100
The deposit is a month's rent.

863
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,420
I'm in the store now.

864
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,900
If you move in,

865
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,140
we'll have a look.

866
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
No problem.

867
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,020
And the water and waste.

868
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,300
I think that

869
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,820
we'll pay a little bit of the deposit.

870
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,580
We'll deduct it from it.

871
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,980
We don't have to pay a month's rent.

872
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,580
Just pay the deposit before the end.

873
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,980
Anything else?

874
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,580
That's the money.

875
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
Okay.

876
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,260
I'll send you the total amount of the WeChat account.

877
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,020
Okay.

878
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,940
Wait.

879
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,180
Because I don't have much

880
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,860
to do with the rent and the interest.

881
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,540
And the previous experience wasn't good.

882
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Although you live for three months,

883
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,060
we should talk about the requirements of each other in advance.

884
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,940
Is that okay?

885
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,260
No problem.

886
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
You first.

887
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,980
For example,

888
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,900
for example,

889
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,420
for example, when the security guard

890
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,260
is resting on the other side.

891
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,020
Okay.

892
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,580
The second is to keep your hygiene.

893
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,900
You can clean up the dirty stuff yourself.

894
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,260
Okay. I got it.

895
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,940
The third is...

896
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,180
The third is

897
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,580
you can't stay in the shopping mall and stay naked.

898
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,780
Come here.

899
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,220
You're so naughty.

900
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,140
The fourth...

901
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,100
The fourth is...

902
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,760
is the last point.

903
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,740
You must let someone else agree

904
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
if you want to take your friend home.

905
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,180
The number of hospitalized people

906
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,300
should not

907
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,140
break anything.

908
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,140
whether it's a letter or a letter.

909
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,140
Do you have a girlfriend?

910
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
I mean, if you have a girlfriend,

911
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
tell her to avoid her misunderstanding

912
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
when she's working with you.

913
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,140
I don't have a girlfriend,

914
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,140
but you don't have to be happy.

915
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
I don't want to talk about it.

916
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Okay.

917
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Okay.

918
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
Then, during our meeting,

919
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,140
if you talk to me,

920
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
we'll talk.

921
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Of course, if I talk to you,

922
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
I'll tell you later.

923
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
I don't want to.

924
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
If I talk to you,

925
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
do you have any?

926
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
I'll talk to you later.

927
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,140
I'll pay for this one.

928
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Before your father left,

929
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
he was already dead.

930
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
ragen,

931
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
don't be afraid.

932
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,860
The con商

933
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,140
is yours.

934
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,140
Show Please.

935
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,980
Excuse me,

936
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,140
excuse me,

937
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,140
om.

938
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
I know the new one.

939
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
I know the roast pork.

940
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Sorry.

941
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,140
The smoke is coming out.

942
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
I know.

943
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Don't talk about it.

944
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
I stole it last time.

945
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
This is the customer's seat.

946
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
Because your room has a separate bathroom.

947
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,140
So I use this.

948
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,140
It's convenient.

949
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Sure.

950
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,140
But my room is small.

951
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,140
Look.

952
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,140
This room is good.

953
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
I want it.

954
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,140
Why?

955
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
Your room has a balcony and a separate bathroom.

956
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
And this room is small.

957
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
It's not good to work.

958
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
Small things are small.

959
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Then please move it back.

960
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
Do you think it's too expensive?

961
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I've already paid 3,000 yuan.

962
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
You still have 3,000 yuan.

963
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,140
You can give me more.

964
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
How can I?

965
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,140
How can I give you more money?

966
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
I can't do that.

967
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
I've decided whether the room is good or not.

968
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,140
It's not the house.

969
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
But do you know

970
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
that you have to live in a good room?

971
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,140
So I'm not a fool.

972
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,140
Is he deliberately giving me his room?

973
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,140
I'm sorry.

974
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,140
I heard that

975
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,140
the most serious disaster in this fire is

976
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,140
the one you suffered.

977
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,140
How is it?

978
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,140
I mean

979
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,140
there is no precious material in the house.

980
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,140
So it's not good.

981
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,140
I'm sorry.

982
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,140
I'm sorry.

983
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
I'm sorry.

984
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,140
I'm sorry.

985
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,140
I'm sorry.

986
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,140
I'm sorry.

987
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,140
I'm sorry.
