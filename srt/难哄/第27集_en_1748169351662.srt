1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that you will be the one to blame.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've loved you before.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've loved you before.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've loved you before.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm telling you.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to marry a man.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A man? How can it be so easy to get married?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll kill you when I'm done.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll kill him.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yifan, we're going to eat.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to go out and meet a friend.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Go out?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do you want me to accompany you?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's raining outside.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's okay.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's okay to go out.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have fun.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll go back soon.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Have fun.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'll go back soon.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to the South-West University.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's your attitude?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Think about it.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We can be classmates.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you know that I can get married.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You know that when I got into the South-West University,

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was very happy.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When you said you wanted to get into the South-West University,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I said that the South-West University

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
was the most beautiful university in the world.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was very happy.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was very happy.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I said that the South-West University

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
was the most beautiful university in the world.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But I said that I would get into the South-West University.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have no other advantages.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You just have to be a good student.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Because he just...

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What's the name of the teacher?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which one?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Remember the Chinese one?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's the name of the teacher?

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's called Red.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's great.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Left foot.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Left foot.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hello?

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The music is a bit off.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I want you to come and see.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll go over there now.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The next week is almost over.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Did you see Sang Yan?

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Not yet.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But he said he was in the airport.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You should know soon.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll go in first.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Record it.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ready?

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ready.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't be nervous.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't be nervous.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Maynid, I'll go to the stage

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and see the music.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They have a problem.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll go with you.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Go.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Listen to the teacher.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now everyone is sitting under the original floor.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go back to the studio.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hurry up.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Did you practice this dance for a long time?

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All of you

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
have seen it.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In a while,

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
even without music,

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I believe that

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
everyone has already recorded

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the rhythm in their hearts.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right?

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now,

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
let's close our eyes with the teacher.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Close your eyes.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Breathe.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Remember

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the happiest moment

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
when we dance.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When we go to the stage later,

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we can just enjoy the dance

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and enjoy the happy feeling.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay?

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay. Stand up.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Maynid.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They have confirmed with me

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
that the music was recorded.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's okay.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Later, you can dance on the stage.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The teacher is below.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Listen to the teacher.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Even without music,

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
we can dance well, right?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We are all the best.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay?

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We can definitely do it, right?

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stand up.

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be ready for a long time.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Be sure to get hurt.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's shout out.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come on.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Come on.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Brother, come on.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you here now?

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She's going to scold me.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm here to teach you, brother.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She's waiting for you.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The next group of performances

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
is a little bit out of the question now.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But they said

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they have practiced for so long.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They have to perform on the stage.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We encourage them again.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The three trainees

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
are the children

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
who are dancing in the studio.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Three, two, one.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Go.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hello.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Please ask the children to perform.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They have performed in the studio.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay. Thank you.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No. 7, Wen Yifan.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wen Yifan, please sing a song.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I feel that the person next to me is Sang Yan.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you want to come to Su Manor?

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's quite handsome.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He's handsome.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think so too.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think so.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He's handsome.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think so too.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So great.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's go.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's go.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Slow down.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I want to go.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're really great.

175
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're so great.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're great today.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Wen Yifan.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Come with me.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is it okay for you?

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, Links.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't go there.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't come there.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't bid for it.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come with me.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
what's wrong with the 的柜 pasta for dinner?

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm afraid I can't do it.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Where are Xiao Xiao and them?

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They said they were going to watch the night view.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Xiao Xiao, let's go.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Xiao Xiao, I'm sorry.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Can you go to the party with us later?

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Although we didn't win the order today,

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm happier than my first life.

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Me, too.

212
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,280
I look after you

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
What is happiness in life?

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,640
I love you.

215
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,920
How can I?

216
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,860
After you came here.

217
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,660
I want to give you five of the five of mine as a Profit call.

218
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I was wondering

219
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
whether I can do this.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,280
You just want to study?

221
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Not really.

222
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,360
I just want to be more capable.

223
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,960
It's not good for me.

224
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,760
It's worth your good.

225
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
You're still working here.

226
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
You said I'm good.

227
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
It's the appearance of that person.

228
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,240
Dad is telling me

229
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
I'm not worthy of doing this.

230
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,000
I will be destroyed by him.

231
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
It's his fault.

232
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,160
There's no need to do anything.

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,640
Understand?

234
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,960
You suddenly disappeared

235
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,560
and took my time.

236
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,320
Understand?

237
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,120
I love you.

238
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,720
I love you.

239
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,920
Thank you.

240
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,200
Ms. He, Xiaoyu,

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,040
did you hide the umbrella?

242
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,120
Yeah.

243
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,760
I should give you the umbrella that day.

244
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,720
What?

245
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,880
When levels reached

246
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
What did you do to uncle?

247
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,280
You came to me that day.

248
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
That day, Xia Yu?

249
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
You just left, right?

250
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,080
You owe me.

251
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
I met Lin Niu Yu at the old man's.

252
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
I was so anxious.

253
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Don't always treat your opponent as a fool.

254
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,880
Why are you laughing?

255
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,880
You videod musicians at home?

256
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,680
When I was a kid.

257
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,680
We were having the sword Catalonia festival for us.

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,480
Why am I mem supportive?

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,080
Doesn't it work here?

260
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,480
But I don't think so.

261
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,280
It is not so.

262
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I literally died in prison.

263
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,580
Ladies.

264
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Two separate expeditions.

265
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Sit.

266
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,620
I'll do it now.

267
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,040
Wait.

268
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,800
Good evening, sir.

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,940
How do you find it?

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,560
No idea.

271
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,340
I'll order a room.

272
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,680
Stay here

273
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,480
Come here

274
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,880
Sit

275
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Just now,

276
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,000
you were taking a bath.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Does it hurt?

278
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,400
This leg was left in the North Sea before.

279
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,520
oil

280
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,880
At that time I escaped from the planet Saturn

281
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Which is said to be the man of my uncle

282
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,640
I jumped from the second floor

283
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
it was left injured at that time

284
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,360
It hurt badly to stay with my child this time

285
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,540
In the first time I met him in Nam Wudi

286
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,340
I was in the car accident.

287
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,180
He was one of the people.

288
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,780
But that night, nothing happened.

289
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,780
When I saw him again,

290
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,380
I was with you at the overtime.

291
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,780
Who knew that he came to our office

292
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,620
to file a case?

293
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
I didn't tell you the truth.

294
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,660
After he moved to Beiyu,

295
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
he lived with us.

296
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,140
He helped the uncle a lot.

297
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,300
So no one dared to

298
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,660
make any objections with him.

299
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,180
No one dared to disturb him.

300
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,180
He...

301
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,900
He was always sad.

302
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,260
Would he have said that

303
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,460
he wanted to help us in his13 days?

304
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,580
Of course.

305
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,380
I had told him.

306
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,900
He broke an inch without telling me.

307
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,140
Isn't it easy?

308
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,140
I could not beية.

309
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Most of them came back after 3 o'clock every day.

310
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,220
But it rained that day.

311
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,180
So they came back early.

312
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,860
Fortunately, they didn't come back early.

313
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
I didn't know what to do at that time.

314
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
No one came to see me.

315
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,020
I didn't have anyone to see me.

316
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Neither did my mom.

317
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,020
So I didn't have anything to do.

318
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
I didn't have anything to do.

319
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,020
So I didn't think about anything.

320
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,020
I just wanted to go to a place far away from Nanwu and North of the South.

321
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

322
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,020
But I really hugged Nanwu University at the beginning.

323
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
I want to go to the university with you.

324
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
I didn't lie to you.

325
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
What did you do?

326
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,020
I told you so many bad things.

327
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
But those were not what I wanted to say.

328
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
It's okay.

329
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,020
It's okay.

330
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
What did you want to say?

331
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
You won't say it now.

332
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,020
I just think I changed my mind.

333
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
I didn't do well.

334
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
And Nanwu University is far away from here.

335
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,020
I don't want you to come to me like you did to Gao Zhong.

336
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
You came to me.

337
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
It's too hard.

338
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Do you still have a mom?

339
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,020
I didn't have a date with anyone.

340
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,020
I just want to date you.

341
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
I know.

342
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
I don't want to date you.

343
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,020
I don't want to date you.

344
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
I just want to date you.

345
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
These words are not good.

346
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Why did I tell you so many bad things?

347
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
Because I only do the best.

348
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
I want to treat you like a blanket.

349
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,400
Sorry to make you when you have a chance out

350
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,320
Why not?

351
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,560
Unless you just ask, I never mass-produced others

352
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,020
I'm sorry, Z�an

353
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,820
I lost my wish

354
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,960
I'm sorry even if I stop

355
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,720
Though I've promised you

356
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,500
I shouldn't have ever?

357
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,020
I was so embarrassed.

358
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,020
At that time, I was so heartless.

359
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,020
He said that this was so embarrassing and shameful.

360
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,020
My relatives told me not to go to the police.

361
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
It's hard to listen to him.

362
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
So I didn't want you to know.

363
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,020
I would have told you at that time.

364
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
Don't be a coward.

365
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,020
Don't listen to those people who say nonsense.

366
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Listen.

367
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Don't be ashamed and ashamed.

368
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Really.

369
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
You did a good job without any hesitation.

370
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
You protected yourself very bravely.

371
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,020
You should have died under the cold, but under the light.

372
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
That person should have lived in the dark.

373
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Listen.

374
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Thank you.

375
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Protect my love.

376
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,020
You are the only one I have.

377
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
And me.

378
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Now you are talking about these things.

379
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,020
If you said those things to me at that time,

380
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
maybe I don't like you.

381
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Do you think I will agree?

382
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,020
You were the one who chased me.

383
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,020
You don't like me either?

384
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Then you should like it.

385
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
You are a girl.

386
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
You like others and you are waiting for others to chase you.

387
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
That's all.

388
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Then I don't need to chase you that way.

389
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
I know.

390
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
You are quite experienced.

391
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
You are not tempered.

392
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
You are quite a couple.

393
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
What?

394
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
Touch me.

395
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
What's wrong?

396
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
I fell down.

397
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
Where did you fall?

398
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
I fell down accidentally.

399
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
How?

400
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Nothing.

401
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
You are so far away.

402
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
How did you fall down?

403
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
Why did you stop?

404
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,020
I don't understand.

405
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,020
So you just want to see the new opening?

406
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,020
And you are still in the mood to see the new opening?

407
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I don't know.

408
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
I don't know.

409
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I don't know.

410
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
I don't know.

411
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,020
And you are still in the mood to see the new opening?

412
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Then I will go to take a shower.

413
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
Then I...

414
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,020
I will wait for you.

415
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Otherwise?

416
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Or do you want to see it directly?

417
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
Yes.

418
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
Yes.

419
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Yes.

420
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
I will go to the new opening.

421
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
I will go to the new opening.

422
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
I will go to the new opening.

423
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
I will go to the new opening.

424
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
I will go to the new opening.

425
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,020
I will go to the new opening.

426
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
I will go to the new opening.

427
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,020
I will go to the new opening.

428
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
I will go to the new opening.

429
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
I will go to the new opening.

430
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
I will go to the new opening.

431
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I will go to the new opening.

432
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
I will go to the new opening.

433
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,020
I will go to the new opening.

434
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
I will go to the new opening.

435
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
I will go to the new opening.

436
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
I will go to the new opening.

437
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
I will go to the new opening.

438
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
I will go to the new opening.

439
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
I will go to the new opening.

440
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
I will go to the new opening.

441
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
I will go to the new opening.

442
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
I will go to the new opening.

443
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,020
I will go to the new opening.

444
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I will go to the new opening.

445
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
I will go to the new opening.

446
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
I will go to the new opening.

447
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
I will go to the new opening.

448
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
I will go to the new opening.

449
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I will go to the new opening.

450
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
I will go to the new opening.

451
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I will go to the new opening.

452
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
I will go to the new opening.

453
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,020
I will go to the new opening.

454
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
Is this your student?

455
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Do you like this function?

456
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
I like it.

457
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
Come.

458
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
You went to the music� Tina Star Festival

459
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
yesterday.

460
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
But they still finish it.

461
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,020
I am touched.

462
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,020
And when they danced,

463
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,020
their eyes were shining.

464
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,020
They reminded me of many things.

465
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,020
In addition, I taught them dancing.

466
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,020
It's better to teach them a lot of things.

467
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
Eat up.

468
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,020
Sister Wang Li, where are you going?

469
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm going home.

470
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,020
Will you come back to visit us?

471
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
Of course.

472
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
I'll come back to visit you when I have time.

473
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Listen up.

474
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Teacher Wen Di is going back.

475
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
When I'm in this situation,

476
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
you should practice dancing.

477
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
I'll come back to visit you anytime.

478
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Okay?

479
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
Okay.

480
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
I'm sorry.

481
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
I was too sudden.

482
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,020
It's okay.

483
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Didn't I say that

484
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
I can finish the practice?

485
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
It's almost time.

486
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
I have to thank you

487
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
for coming to practice.

488
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,020
So he's the person you're looking for?

489
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Yes, me.

490
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
Can we have a chat?

491
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Sure.

492
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,020
When will we be able to take pictures with you?

493
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,020
We'll have a big photo shoot.

494
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Let's take a photo.

495
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
And then we'll take a photo together.

496
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
Okay.

497
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
Let's take a photo.

498
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,020
One, two, three.

499
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,020
It's so beautiful.

500
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,020
You're dancing.

501
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
We should take a photo together.

502
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
You're so happy.

503
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Three, two, one.

504
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Place

505
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
DK

506
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:44,220
YL

507
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,020
Why did you know that?

508
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
I know where Liu Jia is.

509
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,420
I'll help you find it.

510
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,460
People and kids

511
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,380
are such lovely family.

512
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,700
They mustn't despise us.

513
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,220
How not?

514
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,420
Let's take it with us,

515
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,020
so we挺 ourselvesять

516
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,020
while we're still rich.

517
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,220
Only our homes are desolate.

518
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,380
How could you just

519
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,740
become self- agreement?

520
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,100
I really admire you.

521
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,700
You have the courage to give up everything and go to the human world to fight.

522
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,980
How do you think about it?

523
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,300
It's because he gave me a lot of courage.

524
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,020
I know that not everything

525
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,700
can be solved in the corner.

526
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,740
You said that although we can't live for love,

527
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,820
but love can really give us a lot of courage.

528
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,180
I can say that giving birth to a child is like that.

529
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,380
The ceremony is over.

530
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,780
You can rest for a while.

531
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,380
If you need anything, call us anytime.

532
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,900
Thank you.

533
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,140
I feel that my position is on another stage.

534
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,180
18th.

535
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,180
I have to be more than you in the first two seasons.

536
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,460
We deserve all the good things. We have to love ourselves.

537
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,340
Oh, right.

538
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,900
Do you want to come back to work?

539
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,660
I said that I will be in the future.

540
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,700
Please accept me and N Zuo.

541
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,780
It's not a big deal. Just accept their test.

542
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,220
No.

543
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,660
Are you getting fat recently?

544
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,460
Do I?

545
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,060
What do you mean?

546
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,020
You used to have a skin-packed bone.

547
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,820
I can see that you are all chubby.

548
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,860
You are so lucky.

549
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,100
I'm going to see Su Lian today.

550
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,700
When I see her, I can recall all of her memories.

551
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,140
You want to go back?

552
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,860
Yes.

553
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,060
Do you agree?

554
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,700
You like this job.

555
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,900
You like it. You want to do it.

556
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,300
I will eat whatever you do.

557
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,020
You are so handsome.

558
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,580
Shouldn't you shout out loud?

559
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,420
I...

560
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,580
I...

561
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
I...

562
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
I...

563
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
I...

564
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I...

565
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I...

566
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,580
I...

567
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
I...

568
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
I...

569
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
I...

570
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
I...

571
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I...

572
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
I...

573
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I...

574
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,580
I...

575
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
I...

576
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,220
I want to see my most handsome man.

577
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,140
You are daughter-in-law.

578
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,580
Do you want fruits?

579
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Just one for you and we'll eat it.

580
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,860
You haven't had something left from your

581
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,820
comprehensive reading these days?

582
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,180
When you last went to Hong Kong.

583
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,620
Have you had a dream?

584
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
Not for long.

585
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,500
I think

586
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,500
I know more and more

587
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,660
how to face pressure.

588
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,140
Then you can just watch it.

589
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,420
I have to go back.

590
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,340
Can I go back to do the news?

591
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,700
Of course.

592
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,100
No one should give up their dream

593
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,220
just for the dream.

594
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,780
But you are in a very stable state now.

595
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,060
You can just go and

596
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,380
give your best.

597
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,020
Thank you, doctor.

598
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
You're welcome. Come on.

599
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,660
You'll go back to the pastiko Gong foliage.

600
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,860
Don't you?

601
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,340
Hurry up.

602
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,900
Not yet.

603
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,140
A second second later.

604
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,220
Good night.

605
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,100
Look.

606
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,980
The reason I told you

607
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,980
left after leaving the village

608
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,820
is not clear.

609
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,460
Right?

610
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,660
Maybe it's because you're passionate about me.

611
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,500
Although I'm not strong enough now,

612
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,220
I still feel like I'm at the top of the line.

613
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,700
You should give me a speech.

614
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,300
I think news can protect people.

615
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,100
While the truth is being revealed,

616
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,100
those who hide in the corner of the dark corner

617
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,540
will be awakened.

618
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,740
So I hope

619
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,500
I can become stronger and more brave

620
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,060
in order to be able to lose the group.

621
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,780
Yifan,

622
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,580
the next challenge will be harder.

623
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,100
I like the state you're in now.

624
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,300
Welcome back.

625
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

626
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,740
Come on.

627
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,660
Hello, Mrs. Fang.

628
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,580
Ms. Wen,

629
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,060
we're going to have a date in March next year.

630
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,060
I'm going to take the house back

631
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,660
and make a wedding room for my daughter.

632
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,060
I'll tell you in advance

633
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,340
that you have time to find a house.

634
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,300
Okay, I got it.

635
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,340
Congratulations.

636
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,460
Thank you.

637
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,860
I've been with Sang Yan for over two years.

638
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,940
Sang Yan has been with her for over two years.

639
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,500
Hello, Mr. Qin.

640
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,140
Yifan.

641
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,420
Are you in the house now?

642
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,340
Yes.

643
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,460
Where's the big guy?

644
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,860
He's next to me.

645
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,020
You two come down.

646
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,740
We're going to the beach now.

647
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,420
Okay, I got it.

648
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
Mr. Qin, I'm going to work.

649
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,460
Pack your things.

650
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,540
Right now?

651
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,140
Yes.

652
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,020
I just received a notice from the interview report.

653
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,940
It's a missing case

654
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,340
of a girl in Beiyu a few years ago.

655
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,140
A woman recently

656
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,340
took a video to the police station to report it.

657
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,380
It seems to be related to this case.

658
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,900
So there's a big breakthrough in the case.

659
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,420
The police are looking for this issue

660
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,740
everywhere.

661
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,780
And they've established a arrest group.

662
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,700
They're trying to arrest this suspect.

663
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,420
Who's the suspect?

664
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,660
It's said that the suspect's wife reported it.

665
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,580
What's the content?

666
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm not quite sure about that.

667
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,580
Hello, comrade.

668
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,900
We're from the South House TV station.

669
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,940
We were in touch with you before.

670
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,660
Come on.

671
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,380
Yifan.

672
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,580
It's you.

673
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,940
Yifan, it's really you.

674
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,980
I haven't seen you for years.

675
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,740
You're a reporter now.

676
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Why are you in Beiyu?

677
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,260
We're here for business.

678
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,420
I'm really happy for you

679
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,700
that you're doing well now.

680
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,900
How are you doing?

681
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,020
Where's Chen Xi?

682
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,020
He's fine.

683
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,540
He just got engaged with his boyfriend.

684
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,300
After you left that year,

685
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,820
he thought of you for a while.

686
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,260
He's been thinking of you with me all the time.

687
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,700
I saw him with me.

688
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,380
He's the one he's been loving.

689
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,020
Congratulations.

690
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,820
You must tell me when you get married.

691
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,220
I will.

692
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,540
Yifan,

693
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,420
we're here for business.

694
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,100
Opposite to quarrel.

695
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,340
It's been a long time and there's something inside.

696
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,580
Let's take a look.

697
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,220
I'm...

698
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,700
scared of the fact

699
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,700
that you can pret tentatively win us over.

700
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,780
So this is

701
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
I'm sorry for leaving.

702
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
What should we do?

703
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,780
What else can we do?

704
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,780
What do we do because we want to?

705
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
We can even kiss.

706
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,780
We can even kiss on the back of the swing.

707
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,780
But,

708
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
I'm very fair here.

709
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
How about this?

710
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
You can kiss me too.

711
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Go out and get some sleep.

712
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,780
Kiss me?

713
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Go out and get some sleep.

714
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm going to go now.

715
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
I'm going to go now.

716
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
I have you.

717
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,780
I'm going to go now.

718
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,780
What's wrong?
