Xiaoyu, don't be afraid.

191
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Mom is here.

192
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Xiaoyu.

193
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Xiaoyu, don't be afraid.

194
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Where's Dad?

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Xiaoyu, don't be afraid.

196
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Mom is here.

197
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Don't be afraid.

198
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Hello, everyone.

199
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm Su Tian, a reporter of Nanwu TV.

200
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I just found out that

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
among the 17 injured people

202
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
who were injured,

203
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
there are 14 injured and young people.

204
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
The three injured and young people are seriously injured.

205
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
The patient is receiving treatment.

206
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Among them,

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
the 7-year-old girl,

208
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Shi Jiayu,

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
who you are most concerned about,

210
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
is still in ICU.

211
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Any latest news

212
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
will be brought to you by the first time.

213
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Is Shi Jiayu still in ICU?

214
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay.

215
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Let me take a look.

216
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Did he turn from ICU

217
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
to normal yellow?

218
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes.

219
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Let me turn on the light.

220
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Okay.

221
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I planned to take Xiaoyu

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
to the hospital

223
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
next month.

224
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
My dad and I got divorced.

225
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
This time,

226
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
he said goodbye to my dad.

227
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
But

228
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
I've been thinking about

229
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
having a baby like this.

230
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Now, Xiaoyu's father

231
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
is still alive.

232
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I just don't know

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
that when Xiaoyu wakes up,

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
how should I tell him?

235
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
It's okay.

236
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I've already changed the medicine.

237
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I can go to see him now.

238
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Okay.

239
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Mom.

240
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Tingting.

241
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
How are you doing over there?

242
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
I didn't dare to disturb you yesterday.

243
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Are you in danger over there?

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
No. I'm fine.

245
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
How is the baby?

246
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Let me see.

247
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Okay.

248
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Look.

249
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Baby is asleep.

250
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
He's asleep?

251
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Mom, you've worked hard.

252
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I have something to do.

253
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I'll hang up.

254
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I'll tell you.

255
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Okay.

256
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Go back to work.

257
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Take care of yourself.

258
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Okay.

259
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
What's wrong?

260
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Are you okay at home?

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I'm fine.

262
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Are you okay?

263
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm fine.

264
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm fine.

265
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
How about this?

266
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Don't go to the scene tomorrow.

267
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
You can stay at the hospital for a while.

268
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
It's okay, Mr. Qian.

269
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm fine after the recovery.

270
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
The hospital needs people to stay.

271
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Don't think too much.

272
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

273
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
You're welcome.

274
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Okay. Don't cry.

275
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
This car

276
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
was parked under the mud.

277
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
The luck is that

278
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
one of the rocks broke

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
and it was parked on the road.

280
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
That made it

281
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
a small space.

282
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
A child could get a victory

283
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
if he got caught in the sky.

284
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
But the size of the sky was small.

285
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Mr. Shi, the father of the child,

286
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
is currently stuck in the car.

287
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Excuse me, team leader Li.

288
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Is it possible to get the position

289
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
of the child

290
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
for saving him

291
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
and his father's position?

292
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
I originally hoped so.

293
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
However,

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
there was a second accident.

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
The car's location is very far away.

296
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
It's getting more difficult to buy.

297
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Although the rescue is very difficult,

298
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
we won't give up as long as we have 1% hope.

299
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Thank you.

300
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Then your media comrades,

301
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
please pay attention to the safety of the body.

302
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Sorry, excuse me.

303
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
You've got us in trouble.

304
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Trouble?

305
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Trouble?

306
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Let's go.

307
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Be careful.

308
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Be careful.

309
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Be careful.

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I forgot to bring this.

311
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
It's called Xiaoyu.

312
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Sister Yifan,

313
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I bought some low-end breakfast here.

314
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
It's very delicious.

315
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Try it.

316
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Thank you.

317
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll take it.

318
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I'll take it.

319
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
What?

320
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Nothing.

321
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Sister Yifan,

322
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm getting more and more impressed by you.

323
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I sleep less and I'm not tired.

324
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I think...

325
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
What do you think?

326
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Nothing.

327
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Wishing you a long life.

328
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Wishing you a long life.

329
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
You should have breakfast first.

330
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
I'll get my Gelatin back.

331
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
There's also jesters.

332
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I want to see your father now.

333
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,920
You too.

334
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,460
I return it and bring a drink to you.

335
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,260
It's just a bottle ofrie.

336
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,260
Don't know if I have the chance

337
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,420
to drive him back to me I won't.

338
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,720
You'll see what you've done, okay?

339
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Bye.

340
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Hello?

341
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,440
I've just got back from the hotel.

342
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,640
Is Y 편 with you?

343
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,520
You guessed it

344
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,600
Don't worry

345
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,880
is everything okay?

346
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,840
I'm a little sleepy.

347
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,080
The eyes are sleepy and can't sleep.

348
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,040
I'll be back to sleep later.

349
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,960
Yifan, I'm going to rest now.

350
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,160
Good night, Yifan.

351
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,400
Good night.

352
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,320
Good night.

353
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,200
The fish over there is very big.

354
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,400
Take care of your health.

355
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,240
Okay.

356
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,520
Good night.

357
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,880
Good night, Yifan.

358
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,080
Good night, Yifan.

359
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Good night, nice night.

360
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
Happy birthday.

361
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,200
I can only give you a minute to kowtow a second.

362
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,120
I'll go there to accompany you.

363
00:17:50,120 --> 00:18:02,300
Yuan Ting, don't

364
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,100
go anywhere with22

365
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:04,420
crescent

366
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,060
總

367
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,580
It's good

368
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,340
Keep going

369
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,620
help

370
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,100
Soon we should realize

371
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,300
we can find a solution

372
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,820
Huh?

373
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
We will use the camera to record every moment

374
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Please keep following our follow-up reports

375
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Okay, okay, everyone, please wake up

376
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Let me say a few words

377
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820
Fu Zhuang, we've been working hard these days

378
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
We made a call last night

379
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Sorry to you

380
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,820
But all the pay this time is worth it

381
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Our live broadcast and reports are all paid by you

382
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,820
So when you come back to Nanwu

383
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
I ask you to take a good look

384
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
How about it?

385
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Thank you, teacher Song

386
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Oh, there's another thing

387
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820
The number of victims and his family's reports

388
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,820
Is quite high online now

389
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Yifan, you followed this point

390
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,820
So you have to stay a few more days to make the follow-up reports

391
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Okay

392
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Okay, that's okay

393
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Everyone, go back and rest

394
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Okay, take a rest

395
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,820
Then we'll go back first, Teacher Qin

396
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
Okay

397
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,820
It seems like it's a bit hard to go back before his birthday

398
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
It's a bit hard

399
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
I've told mom

400
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
I won't go abroad with him

401
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,820
I want to stay here with dad

402
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I gave up on the nursing rights

403
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
Because

404
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
I was able to give Xiaoyu a better life

405
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Our marriage continues again

406
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
I want to be with dad

407
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
It's not his problem

408
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
I'm not leaving

409
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
This topic

410
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
How about letting Xiaoyu go back

411
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
No need

412
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
He's already a big child

413
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
We used to be a family

414
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
He has the right to know this

415
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
He's already passed this level

416
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
You see, Xiaoyu and I

417
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Have become stronger

418
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,820
More brave

419
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Is it Xiaoyu?

420
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
Can you wait a minute?

421
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Okay

422
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Miss Lin, Miss Lin

423
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
Don't you think about

424
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Accepting our interview?

425
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
No

426
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
I know

427
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
You must have a lot of difficulties

428
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,820
You must not want to give up on the nursing rights

429
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
I was with Shilei

430
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
I had a quarrel about money

431
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Now I think about it

432
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Life is really fragile

433
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
People who can come and go safely

434
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
Don't leave regrets

435
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Is the biggest happiness

436
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I don't care what others say

437
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
I just don't want to hurt Xiaoyu

438
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Mom, why are you there?

439
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
Why don't you come over?

440
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,820
Mom

441
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Don't leave regrets

442
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
Is it bitter?

443
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,820
I don't care

444
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,820
What's the matter?

445
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
Do you want to go to the hospital?

446
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
I have an urgent matter

447
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
I hope that you can

448
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Have a good end

449
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
I know

450
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Sister Yifan

451
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Are we going to the hotel now?

452
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
Yes

453
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
What's up?

454
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
Did you meet someone?

455
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Do you know anyone?

456
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
No

457
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Did you just hear someone calling me?

458
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,100
I'm not sure, but it seems like it.

459
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,740
It seems like it's a man.

460
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,420
I don't have one.

461
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,500
Happy birthday.

462
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
It's lucky that it's past midnight.

463
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
Hello.

464
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
Hello.

465
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
I made you some cake.

466
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,820
It will be delivered to your home at noon.

467
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
And if it's a gift,

468
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
can I go back to the North Pole?

469
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
It's quite sincere.

470
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
I've kept it for 70 days.

471
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
But I can't go back today.

472
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
I can only come back tomorrow.

473
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
Okay.

474
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Happy birthday.

475
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
Okay.

476
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Let's celebrate my birthday this year.

477
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
One more day.

478
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
One more day.

479
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Happy birthday.

480
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
It's raining.

481
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
Are you worried?

482
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,820
Yifan, don't you want to sleep?

483
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,820
How was the exam today?

484
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,820
It was good this morning.

485
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,820
I'll continue my studies in the afternoon.

486
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I'll be better tomorrow.

487
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
I'm so tired.

488
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,820
I'm so tired.

489
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,820
I'm so tired.

490
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
I'm so tired.

491
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820
I'm so tired.

492
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,820
I'm so tired.

493
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
I'm so tired.

494
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I'm so tired.

495
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,820
I'm so tired.

496
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,820
I'm so tired.

497
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
I'm so tired.

498
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm so tired.

499
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,820
I'm so tired.

500
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
I'm so tired.

501
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,820
I'm so tired.

502
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
I'm so tired.

503
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
I'm so tired.

504
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,820
I'm so tired.

505
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,820
I'm so exhausted.

506
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
I'm so fat.

507
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,820
Class chacun

508
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,520
OK

509
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,100
In this thing, you can never be yourselves.

510
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,680
He came and then said that he gets locked up secretly in your room.

511
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,760
Just這一leculation,

512
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,560
we all have to chant about that he loves you diseasely.

513
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,020
That's because I'm here to heal you.

514
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,980
So you will be perd место, and you are healed with cold.

515
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,860
Don't think about it.

516
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,840
I've been盯着你,

517
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,240
I prepared the room for you to sleep.

518
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,840
You two wouldn't care if I can't hug you,

519
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,540
b 16005?

520
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,900
I don't care.

521
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,300
Everything is still the same as before.

522
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,300
What do you want to eat?

523
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,900
I want...

524
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,300
I want a bowl of cloud noodles.

525
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,500
Little boy, it's you.

526
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,300
It's been a long time since we last met.

527
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Yes.

528
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,500
I just finished my exam and I'm now in the city.

529
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,100
Okay, sit down. I'll make noodles.

530
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,300
I'll be back in a bit.

531
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,100
Okay.

532
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,100
You haven't sent me a friend's message in 800 years, right?

533
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,900
What's wrong with you today?

534
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Hello.

535
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,900
I want to go to Patu depending on financial situation.

536
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,540
Xing Xiaobao.

537
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,460
此時不再被釣 instant noodles

538
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,980
いい restrictions.

539
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,740
They are too many.

540
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
You're going to the door again.

541
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,980
Eat.

542
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,140
The break-up in the rain

543
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,740
was the expression I've never seen on her face.

544
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,380
I should

545
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:04,380
give her all the good things in the world.

546
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,380
She was such a young girl

547
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
back then.

548
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,380
I can always be a man.

549
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,380
You deserve all the good things.

550
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,340
HEY,

551
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,380
I should be brave for her since I started this one.

552
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,140
I used my detailed tricks.

553
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,160
Angel Li Didn't you see the Chinese government

554
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,960
that runs this dead body of yours?

555
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,000
Angel Li Dis Majesty

556
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,060
Vorside

557
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,180
What's wrong?

558
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,760
Tell me you said before

559
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:05,800
What

560
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,340
I say

561
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:12,980
I said

562
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,900
But he's a 230-animal.

563
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,020
Can't burn it.

564
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,860
It's not that bad

565
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,060
Of course

566
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
I love you

567
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
Little girl

568
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I can't even hear it for half an hour

569
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
I'll give you a break

570
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
I want to sit for a while

571
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Wait for Yu Ting, okay?

572
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Okay, no problem

573
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,020
It shouldn't be here anymore

574
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
I want to sit for a while more

575
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,020
It seems like I've made a dream

576
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,020
What do you want to eat?

577
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Next time

578
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
This time, I'm here to see someone

579
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,020
I love you

580
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,020
It's you

581
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,020
I saw this little girl coming here alone

582
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,020
I thought you two were not connected

583
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
It's great

584
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
It's been so many years

585
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
We're still together

586
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
Next time, I'll come to Beiyu to take care of you

587
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
Okay

588
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
Why are you here?

589
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
That door

590
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
You're eating so quickly

591
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Are you here to eat?

592
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
How do you know I'm here?

593
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm here to wash the dishes in Beiyu

594
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
What's the matter?

595
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,020
I'm thinking if I'm the boss

596
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
I'll be here

597
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Did you think about it?

598
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
What about you?

599
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,020
If it's your turn, I want to be the boss

600
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Me?

601
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,020
I want to see a small shop

602
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
It's not big

603
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
I said a small shop is the kind

604
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
that can be used for a long time

605
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
and has a lot of pressure

606
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
I...

607
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,020
I want that kind of...

608
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
Students can come in and eat noodles

609
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
and see the books

610
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,020
The next shift is the night

611
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
I'll come in and eat

612
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,020
I'll also listen to my favorite music

613
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
The next shift is the night

614
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
I'll come to the kitchen

615
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,020
At the time, the guests can come here

616
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,020
to work and eat noodles

617
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
It won't feel like they're doing overtime

618
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,320
Your name?

619
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,700
Backing?

620
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,220
Your name?

621
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,460
What's wrong?

622
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,820
Is it related to the store?

623
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,020
No, it's my favorite store

624
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,680
Okay

625
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,500
Tell me

626
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Eat noodles.

627
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,500
When I have money, I'll take it here and open a place for you.

628
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
A place that will relax your family.

629
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Wen Ji Zhe, you've been working overtime for a week.

630
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,500
My friend said that the new restaurant of the restaurant is open.

631
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
The boss is so handsome.

632
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm the boss of the overtime.

633
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I'm Song.

634
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Take it.

635
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
I...

636
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
Give me.

637
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Where's the phone?

638
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,500
I've always felt very lucky to say something.

639
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I'm even embarrassed to say it myself.

640
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
But in this life,

641
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
I've never said it.

642
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
You...

643
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
You haven't found out yet?

644
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
All these years,

645
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,500
I still only like you.

646
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
I can't hear you.

647
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
The sky is full of clouds.

648
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,500
When I have you in my life,

649
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I can see the light in front of me.

650
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Say something.

651
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,500
If you think these words are very delicate,

652
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I'll say it in the future.

653
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,500
But I'm a little bit tired now.

654
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
We are...

655
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
We are...

656
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
We are...

657
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
We are...

658
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Love and fate.

659
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
So from now on,

660
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
you are my best friend.

661
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Yes.

662
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,500
You're so happy.

663
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Yes.

664
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I'm so happy to have a man like me.

665
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
I'm really happy to have a man like you.

666
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Go back.

667
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Take a little bit of my umbrella.

668
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
You're wet.

669
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
It's warm.

670
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Can you not have so many opinions when you want to say others' blessings?

671
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,500
And you have to be treated like this.

672
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
What are you doing?

673
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
I want to buy something.

674
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I want two apples.

675
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Okay.

676
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Do you want apples?

677
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I said I want to give you a real one.

678
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Let's celebrate my birthday tomorrow.

679
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
One day left.

680
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
I'm so happy to have a man like you.

681
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
What's wrong?

682
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
What's wrong?

683
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,500
What you said before is still the same as me.

684
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
You said...

685
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
If I chase you, you can consider it.

686
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

687
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
You can consider it.

688
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

689
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
You can consider it.

690
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

691
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
You can consider it.

692
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

693
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

694
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

I really don't want to tell you this.

696

I really don't want to tell you this.

697
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

698
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

699
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

700
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

701
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

702
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

703
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

704
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
I really don't want to tell you this.

Sorry, sir.

Stay here.

We will go on a journey together

It's you in the wind

753
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,400
That doesn't want me to come

754
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,920
It's you standing by me

755
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,000
By my side

756
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,560
This road is a long road

757
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,080
The sky and the earth are full of flowers

758
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,600
But I have your voice

759
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,040
How can I give up?

760
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
I won't give up

761
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,120
You give me

762
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,680
The future with me

763
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,120
Is you

764
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,240
Pretending to be me every night

765
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,400
Even if it's a lie

766
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,320
I won't be so lonely

767
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,720
Until you are ready

768
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,760
I can only be in the dark

769
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,640
I can only be in the dark

770
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,240
I can only be in the dark

771
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,240
I can only be in the dark

772
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,240
I can only be in the dark

773
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,240
I can only be in the dark

774
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,240
I can only be in the dark

775
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,240
I can only be in the dark
