1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The most beautiful view.

2
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Only you today?

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Do you want to have a bowl of noodles?

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
I want to have a bowl of noodles today.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
The bowl of noodles?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,880
It's okay, let's have a bowl of noodles together.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Enjoy.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you nervous?

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, I'm not.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You?

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're not. How can I lose to you?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm in the noodle restaurant now.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't make a deal.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll definitely...

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
discuss with you about my plan.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You...

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are properly respected,

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I especially couldn't oppose you.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not afraid.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Here!

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you like noodles?

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Son of a bitch!

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't have any sort of thing.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So comfortable.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
I heard that your family is coming.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
So?

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,600
So I'm going to pick you up

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
and become your next roommate.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Next...

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,800
...person.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm afraid that you'll get used to living here.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't you want to leave?

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I haven't promised you that you can move in.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't worry.

39
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
I'll definitely become a better roommate.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I won't cause you any trouble.

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
I won't give you any trouble.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I can just turn around.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
The kitchen is so big.

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
There's a whole kitchen and a washing machine.

45
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Clean and clean.

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,800
Don't worry about washing dishes anymore.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
A toilet machine.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
Let me feed you.

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Senior Sun, you should have a flat nose.

50
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,200
But it's very stressful for someone like you.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,800
I'll have a bigger flat nose.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
And he's usually very close to you.

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Let me take a look at my future room.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
I refuse.

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Xiao Mu, you're making me feel so uncomfortable today.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
And you're looking for Senior Sun.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,200
You didn't...

58
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,600
You didn't say hello to Senior Sun.

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I don't think that's good.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,200
Yifan, you said that those things were all not a problem.

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,600
Now that you're a good roommate, you're much more difficult to find than a good house.

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
In the future, you can't find a good house.

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You can't find a good house.

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
You can't find a good roommate.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
In the future, you can become a roommate and add me to your family.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,600
We can work together, work together, and cook together.

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Isn't it good to take care of each other?

68
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Xiao Mu, you should go back first.

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
If anything happens, wait until this room is really empty.

70
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
And I don't like to be in a relationship with men.

71
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Then what about Senior Sun?

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
He... He's a special guest.

73
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Don't do this again.

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Bye-bye.

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I never said that I would come to see you.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I don't know how he suddenly came here.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Maybe it was before that Tian Jie mentioned that I was looking for a roommate.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
He heard it.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
So...

80
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
So you just like my roommate?

81
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Of course not.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
But...

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
But your house is almost renovated.

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm afraid if you suddenly move out,

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'll have to take over the house alone.

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
The house is already yours.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
The rent is already yours.

88
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
So...

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
How long will you live?

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
How about you?

91
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I hope I can live longer.

92
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Or...

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Or...

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I'll wait for you to find a girlfriend.

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
It's not convenient to say that.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll go back to my room first.

97
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Okay.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
He will move out one day.

99
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Why do you care?

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't worry.

101
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
There is no one in the world that can be saved.

102
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
These are the two results.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
No matter what happens,

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I'll always be there for you.

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You have to be mentally prepared.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Don't you know how to do it?

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
You have to save him.

108
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
You've tried your best.

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I don't know what to do.

110
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I don't want you to be saved.

111
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Be careful.

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
The other person may be like his father.

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
The patient will be fine.

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
He will be in a state of no good.

115
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
He is 44 years old.

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
He will never leave me.

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
On March 11th,

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
at 14.04 pm,

119
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Wu Xiao was released from the hospital.

120
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Please keep your hands off.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Aqiang, hurry up.

122
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I'll be waiting for you.

123
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Be careful.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
It's okay.

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
He may be like his mother.

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,600
He can have a better life for himself.

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
He chose to abandon me.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I hate people who are always separated.

129
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
They say goodbye.

130
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Why don't we not get used to it?

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
We can't get used to it.

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
We shouldn't get used to it.

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Don't be afraid.

134
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Why are you here?

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm here to see you.

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
A Sun's wife.

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Sun's wife?

138
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Yes.

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Lingling.

140
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Lingling!

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Zhong Xiao.

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Hello?

143
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Zhong Xiao, I say the end.

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm not free. You can find someone else.

145
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Grandpa is at my house now.

146
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
He said he wanted to find Wang Linlin.

147
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,600
I forgot which time I was drunk.

148
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I told him that we were married and we were meant to be.

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
We were meant to live together.

150
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,800
Please come to my house now.

151
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm not free now.

152
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
What?

153
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
Please.

154
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Please, this time.

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Good night.

156
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Grandpa, Linlin went to her house to celebrate her birthday.

157
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
She won't be back today.

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I just want to wait for Linlin to come back.

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
By the way, let me ask you.

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Why didn't you go to your parents' house to see your brother?

161
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I'll find more time.

162
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I'll go to my parents' house.

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll go to my parents' house.

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll go to my parents' house.

165
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Really?

166
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes.

167
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
I've heard from the management of my house.

168
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
In the past two years, there was no one else except me and your grandma.

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Let me ask you.

170
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Do you really dislike them?

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I'm busy with work.

172
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm really busy. You'll know when you come next time.

173
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
How busy you are!

174
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Look, Linlin, you should finish your work.

175
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
You'll be late for the day.

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Linlin, I don't want you.

177
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Why are you coming back now?

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Grandpa, I'm back.

179
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Where did you go?

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I only used the toilet paper at home.

181
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm going to buy some today.

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Didn't you go to your parents' house to celebrate her birthday?

183
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Yes, I opened the supermarket at my friend's house.

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
She's celebrating her birthday today.

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Xiao Han, go and buy some.

186
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
We'll have the best breakfast.

187
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
It's your birthday. I'll take you to your house.

188
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Grandpa, you've bought a whole night.

189
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
You forgot?

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
It's been so long.

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Grandpa, I'm not hungry.

192
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes, he's not hungry.

193
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
What do you mean?

194
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
You can buy this bag for Linlin.

195
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You can buy this bag for grandpa.

196
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Go.

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Go?

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm so worried.

199
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Linlin, I want to ask you a few questions.

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Are you used to sleeping on the left or on the right?

201
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
On the right.

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
That's weird.

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Xiao Han is a kid.

204
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
He sleeps on the right.

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Yes, I know.

206
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
But I've been sleeping on the right since I was a kid.

207
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
So he let me sleep on the right.

208
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
What about your clothes?

209
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Grandpa said it's not good looking.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
He bought me new clothes.

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
So I'll take his clothes off for now.

212
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
It's loose and comfortable.

213
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
And it's sweet.

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Are you hiding something from me?

215
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Xiao Han, you're lying to me.

216
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You're not living together, are you?

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
You're getting married soon.

218
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
What's your problem?

219
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
After you get married,

220
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
you can't sleep at night

221
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
when you sleep on the right.

222
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
You can't sleep at home

223
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
when you get off work.

224
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
You can't do housework.

225
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Wang Xiaorou's bitter-skinned windmill

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
is a long-awaited story.

227
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
The house is so messy.

228
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Grandpa, you're quite ahead of your thinking.

229
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Grandpa is young.

230
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Love is a nightmare.

231
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Xiao Han has been doing things

232
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
since he was a kid.

233
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
He's been working hard

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
to hide his feelings.

235
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Don't worry.

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I know how to do it, Grandpa.

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
How did it change?

238
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Don't worry.

239
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I don't mind.

240
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,280
fiveís

241
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Since when did you tie it up sotight?

242
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
I've cooked too much porridge. Help me eat some.

243
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
I'll just eat the pulse.

244
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm going.

245
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I can't get used to everything.

246
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I was the best when I came back to the beginning.

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm used to having his world.

248
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Maybe one day, he'll disappear.

249
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm used to being with him.

250
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
I'm used to being with him.

251
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
He'll disappear one day.

252
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Good morning, Yifan.

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Morning.

254
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Morning.

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
This is the breakfast I prepared for you.

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
I'll share it with you.

257
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
I've eaten it this morning. You can eat it yourself.

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Just help me.

259
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
I can't finish it all.

260
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Morning.

261
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Morning, sister.

262
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Where's the breakfast?

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Have a taste.

264
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
He's done a lot.

265
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Let me help you.

266
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Okay. I haven't eaten it yet.

267
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I'll have it.

268
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I'll have it.

269
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I'll have it.

270
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Thank you, sister.

271
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Yifan.

272
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm sorry to say this.

273
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Did you get into a fight with Sang Yan yesterday?

274
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Yes.

275
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
But I just don't understand.

276
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
He's not warm at all.

277
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Yifan, why do you have to be so serious?

278
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Yifan, why do you have to feel wronged

279
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
to live with him?

280
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
You deserve better things.

281
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
I don't feel wronged.

282
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Maybe I'm used to it.

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Yifan, the God of Finance has come to you.

284
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Morning.

285
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Chengyu, did you have breakfast?

286
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Morning.

287
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Did you buy two servings together?

288
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Yifan, I hope you know how to treat yourself.

289
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
You need to look at yourself.

290
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Who really treats you well?

291
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Don't always think that others are bullying you.

292
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
This is bad habit. You have to change it.

293
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Okay. Thank you, aunt.

294
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
And,

295
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
I think I should be able to distinguish

296
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
what is bad habit.

297
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Director Shen,

298
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I sent you a big interview last night

299
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
for the big company.

300
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I've arranged the interview

301
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
for your team.

302
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Is there any problem with my interview?

303
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
I heard about you

304
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
in the Daily Daily.

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Although this is your personal matter,

306
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,600
the big company is using this reason to reject you.

307
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
You can go back now.

308
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Go away.

309
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
You're Wen Yifan, right?

310
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Human being has all the six senses.

311
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I won't judge you

312
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
if you're here.

313
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,080
Take a look at this two of them.

314
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,480
I'll show you where they go first.

315
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,360
Get out of my sight or I'll beat you to death.

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,900
F ilei, what happened?

317
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,520
Why is the face so pale?

318
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,620
Fulei.

319
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,140
How are you?

320
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
Let's go.

321
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,440
The person over there is Zhang Yifan.

322
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
Cut it out.

323
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,340
Let's go and help him.

324
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,100
Hello?

325
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
I am the last one to come to your place.

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
You guys...

327
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I don't want to see you anymore.

328
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
What do you want?

329
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Ji Yao.

330
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Did you see the message I sent you?

331
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Your aunt is back in Beiyu.

332
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I am not going to see her again.

333
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Your aunt is back in Beiyu.

334
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Did your mom forget to tell you...

335
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,600
How did you come in?

336
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I won't let her come in again.

337
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
How did you come in?

338
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I am your mom.

339
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Can you not feel my mom?

340
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
Jiang.

341
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
I talked to your aunt for a while.

342
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I didn't know anything about the past.

343
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
So I didn't stand by your side.

344
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I was sorry to you.

345
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
But I thought they took good care of you.

346
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I was very worried.

347
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I wanted to take you back.

348
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I am sorry.

349
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,600
But if you are afraid that the house will affect your reputation,

350
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I am not worried.

351
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
I am wrong.

352
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I am wrong.

353
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
I am not a good person.

354
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
I just want to wait for a while.

355
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
When you come back to Nan Wu University,

356
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I will take good care of you.

357
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I have to go.

358
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
You told me to drive you home.

359
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
She is waiting outside.

360
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I will call you back.

361
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
You are so rude.

362
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I didn't expect that...

363
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
you will report to a place so far away.

364
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Will you live with me in Nan Wu University?

365
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Jiang.

366
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
I will make up for you.

367
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Okay?

368
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Don't...

369
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Don't be angry with me.

370
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
What else do you want to say?

371
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I have to work.

372
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
I got you something you like.

373
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You are too thin.

374
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
No need. Thank you.

375
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Jiang.

376
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Jiang.

377
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I am so tired.

378
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Okay.

379
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,600
You can goЯ

380
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
What are you going to do?

381
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
I·ve cut it again.

382
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Nan...

383
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Will you protect your mother line?

384
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Jia.

385
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Where am I?

386
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,520
Never mind.

387
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,020
No need to wait for her anymore.

388
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,160
Li' tomato

389
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,160
Let's just go to the بن ,

390
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm tired.

391
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:14,160
As you expect,

392
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
I'll take a look.

393
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
You're so good.

394
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,160
But you didn't even want to come to my side to support me.

395
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,160
You know that I'm the one who's been working in this company for a long time.

396
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,160
If you don't believe me, I'll tell them the same thing.

397
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Wang Gao, don't think about me.

398
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
How should I explain this?

399
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
This matter...

400
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Sorry, I've already explained everything about what happened in the first and second day of the press conference.

401
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I don't understand why such a ridiculous rumor can continue to spread in our press conference.

402
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Finally, I have to take responsibility for these false accusations.

403
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
False accusations?

404
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,160
If we, as reporters, don't seek the truth and don't seek the truth,

405
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
what's the difference between gossip and small news?

406
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Where are the persistence of these reporters?

407
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Okay, you're right.

408
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Yifan, you've been working in this company for a year.

409
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160
We must be brave enough to do our job as a journalist.

410
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
We must not find out the truth and never give up.

411
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,160
We must not be afraid of the truth.

412
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,160
But some people forget the basic truth of this company for a long time.

413
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Am I right, Mr. Wang?

414
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
No, I'm like this.

415
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,160
If someone thinks I'm running away from this position because of my relationship,

416
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:57,160
I'll try my best to prove my ability by using practical actions and using my grades to block their mouths.

417
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Do you understand what I mean?

418
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Thank you, Director Kang.

419
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
I'll get back to work.

420
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
I'll see you out.

421
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Okay.

422
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Yifan, you've changed your habit.

423
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Your habit is to like to make yourself suffer.

424
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
But you said that word just now.

425
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
You're so generous.

426
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
You're so cool.

427
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
You're so nice to the one who bullied you.

428
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Do you want to drink?

429
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
No, I don't want to.

430
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
This wine is not that easy to drink.

431
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
What's wrong?

432
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I forgot the rules.

433
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
If you don't come back at 10 o'clock, tell me.

434
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Okay.

435
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
I'll go get some water.

436
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Okay.

437
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Okay.

438
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I'll go get some water.

439
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
I forgot.

440
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Sorry.

441
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
How do I feel that you've been a little...

442
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
a little bit...

443
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm just sleepy.

444
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
I want to sleep.

445
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
Then you can sleep.

446
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,160
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
So you're...

448
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
in a bad mood and drunk.

449
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
You're back to your dream.

450
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
What's wrong with you today?

451
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm sorry.

452
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Are you going out?

453
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
What are you looking at?

454
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Why are you like a pervert?

455
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Where are you going?

456
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,160
You're not the one who's going to the wrong place.

457
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
This is not your room.

458
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Your room is over there.

459
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Over there.

460
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Go.

461
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Go.

462
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Go.

463
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
What's wrong?

464
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Go.

465
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Your room is over there.

466
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Go.

467
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
You're so mean.

468
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
You're not looking for me?

469
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160
I think you're okay.

470
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
I can't see you're always so upset.

471
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
I'm sorry.

472
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I'm used to sleeping and preparing to go to bed.

473
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,160
I'm still a strawberry.

474
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
You're so talented.

475
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Really?

476
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,160
I used to think that reporters are all so mean.

477
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I hope you can be a good singer.

478
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Thank you.

479
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Thank you for your hard work.

480
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
You too.

481
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Yifan, you've succeeded.

482
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
There are many kinds of reporters.

483
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
They don't like me.

484
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
No.

485
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
I think they're quite comfortable.

486
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
We're not service workers.

487
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
We're not just comfortable to let the victims go.

488
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,160
The truth is the most important.

489
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Of course, it's better to be humble.

490
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
You're a trainee.

491
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
You're not a good singer.

492
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
You're also a trainee.

493
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,160
You should be the best in the world.

494
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
You can do it.

495
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
You've worked hard today.

496
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Yifan,

497
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
are you free after work tomorrow?

498
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Are you sure?

499
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Okay.

500
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
It's okay. I'll take it.

501
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
It's like Xiaoyu.

502
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
Yifan,

503
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
I have a friend who knows me.

504
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
She just gave birth to a girl.

505
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,160
So I want to buy a gift for her.

506
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
But I don't understand it.

507
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,160
So I want to ask if you can pick one with me.

508
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
A girl?

509
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Yes.

510
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
You can ask Zhenyu.

511
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
She has a daughter.

512
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I don't know it.

513
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Zhenyu.

514
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm not familiar with her.

515
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
It's okay. I'll tell her.

516
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Let's go.

517
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Yifan, wait a minute.

518
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I think you have something dirty on your neck.

519
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
I want to help you.

520
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I'm sorry.

521
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
I'm sorry.

522
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
I was so careless.

523
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
I didn't hurt you.

524
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
It's okay.

525
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,160
I just didn't expect you to react so much.

526
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
I don't like being exposed by others.

527
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Yifan.

529
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Zhizhi.

530
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Why are you here?

531
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm here to see my brother.

532
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
He seems to be not back yet.

533
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Come in first.

534
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Okay.

535
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Sit down.

536
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
I'm here to see my brother.

537
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Sit down.

538
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Have you been out of the library recently?

539
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Did you get a good grade?

540
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Yes.

541
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Which university did you like?

542
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
The University of the United Nations.

543
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
The University of the United Nations.

544
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
The University of the United Nations is far away.

545
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Have you thought about it?

546
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I've thought about it.

547
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
I've thought about it for a long time.

548
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
It's like the South.

549
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,160
The major I want to report will be better.

550
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
And I don't want to stay in the South.

551
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,160
I want to go to other cities.

552
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
It's good.

553
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
But I don't seem to be happy.

554
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Why?

555
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
Actually, I didn't tell him

556
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
about my parents' relationship.

557
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
So he thought

558
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
I was a man.

559
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
He started to talk to me

560
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
after I knew it was a big deal.

561
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Brother.

562
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Brother.

563
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Take off your clothes.

564
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Okay.

565
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Let me help you.

566
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
I've got a question.

567
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Do you know who was the leader

568
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
of the legendary team at the time?

569
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm not sure.

570
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
Why did you ask me that?

571
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Because I think

572
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
he looked like

573
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
the one who was angry

574
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
when he was playing with Zhixian.

575
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
He was alone for days.

576
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
He was not polite.

577
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,160
I think he was a good guy.

578
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,160
I don't think my brother

579
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
liked his relationship with the early age.

580
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
At that time,

581
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
my brother was not doing well.

582
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
He suddenly

583
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
got back on his feet

584
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
when he was a kid.

585
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
He didn't do anything

586
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,160
except learning.

587
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
My parents were very happy at that time.

588
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
They thought he finally understood.

589
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I think

590
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
someone must have encouraged him.

591
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I guess he was the girl

592
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
who was in the early age.

593
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
What did you talk about?

594
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Our girl knows

595
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
how to thank you.

596
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Brother,

597
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I didn't tell you

598
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
that I was wrong this time.

599
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
But I did a good job

600
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
choosing

601
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
my favorite university and major.

602
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Isn't that a good thing?

603
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,160
I just don't like Yi He.

604
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
I didn't hear that

605
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Yi He was doing something bad.

606
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Are you done?

607
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,160
You should eat quickly

608
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
if you are not done.

609
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
You have to eat here

610
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
before you wake up.

611
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
You can go back by car later.

612
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I'm hungry.

613
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I'm going to sleep.

614
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Yifan.

615
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
What's wrong?

616
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Maybe I'm not used to

617
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
sleeping well.

618
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Did I get a headache?

619
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
It's hard to get used to

620
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
sleeping like this.

621
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Yifan.

622
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
Do you need my help?

623
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
No, thanks.

624
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Go back.

625
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Okay, I'm leaving.

626
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
I'll see you next time.

627
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
Take care.

628
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
I'm so embarrassed

629
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
to eat.

630
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
I can't digest it.

631
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
I'm going to buy something.

632
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
I can't make it in time.

633
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
It turns out that the problem is fake.

634
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Don't talk to me.

635
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
I'm angry.

636
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Yifan.

637
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Don't you want to go to the hospital?

638
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
His attitude is like

639
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
I was so bad at the beginning.

640
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
And then I secretly kept it

641
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
and kept it from everyone.

642
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I want to be cured.

643
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,160
At the same time,

644
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
I can't see Cuuuu's face.

645
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
I've never seen it before.

646
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
It's too dark.

647
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,160
entonces,

648
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I kept telling her

649
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I can't see Cuuuu in this space.

650
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
I examined everyone

651
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,160
and器w able to reduce it.

652
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Then,

653
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,660
she suddenly

654
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,160
was drunk.

655
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Not that long ago,

656
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
she Nousi

657
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
already recognized

658
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
thanks to Lu Suren.

659
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,960
He was so happy when the result was out.

660
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,160
He said that he would visit him whenever he needed.

661
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,760
He was so excited to go out.

662
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,160
He was so happy to see him tonight.

663
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,760
I think someone would encourage him.

664
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,160
I'm the director's wife.

665
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,360
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,560
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,960
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm sorry.

669
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,560
I'm sorry.

670
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,760

I'm sorry.

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,360
I'm sorry.

675
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,560
I'm sorry.

676
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,960
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,360
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,760
I'm sorry.

679
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,160
I'm sorry.

680
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm sorry.

681
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm sorry.

682
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,360
I'm sorry.

683
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,160
I'm sorry.

684
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,560
I'm sorry.

685
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,720
I'm sorry.

686
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,060
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,560
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,560
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,960
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,960
You're so flattered.

694
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,960
I'll rest that thing!

697
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,040
solving

698
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,560
Just today,

699
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,840
it's your second try!

700
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,360
Good serious job.

701
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
