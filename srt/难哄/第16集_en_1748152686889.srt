1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a happy life without you.

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A-Yi, tomorrow is a double-edged sword.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you remember to wear more clothes?

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Double-edged sword?

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Did anyone say happy birthday to him?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, the number you dialed is not available. Please call the number you dialed.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The number you dialed is an air號 number. Please pair with your partner to dial.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The number you dialed is not in service. Please check the number and dial again.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello, the number you dialed is an air號 number. Please pair with your partner to dial.

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
I don't know how much it will help.

18
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
I just want to be able to help people.

19
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,000
The number you have dialed is not at service.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,320
Please do not worry about it again.

21
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing when you are at school?

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Give me your phone.

23
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's wrong?

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My phone is broken.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My birthday is broken.

26
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,200
My chain!

27
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Why?

28
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
You aren't holding gas for that?

29
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm not a white woman.

30
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,000
Hurry up and say it.

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
Why are you so early?

32
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Actually, I'm a man now.

33
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
I've always wanted to be together with you.

34
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
I'm telling you.

35
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Men can't be

36
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,320
100% pure.

37
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,080
Yes.

38
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,040
Men.

39
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,600
Men are not.

40
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
I don't know this word.

41
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Why don't you admit it?

42
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
I don't know this word.

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Because you can't use this

44
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
the kind of play

45
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,400
that the public likes.

46
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
You have to play it.

47
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,640
It's different between a man and a woman.

48
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Right?

49
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,480
Yes.

50
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,120
You...

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,960
Sister Dao.

53
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,040
I think I've broken my key.

54
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,200
What should we do?

55
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,160
What?

56
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,880
Hurry up.

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,560
Go.

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Hit 120.

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,360
120.

60
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,000
120.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,120
It's okay.

62
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,240
Let's wait outside.

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,000
Come on.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,880
Come on.

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,280
Who is the father of the child?

66
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not me.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,880
Sorry.

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,080
How could it be me?

69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,200
Doctor.

70
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
He's a single mother.

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,040
He just separated from his ex-husband.

72
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,280
What's the situation?

73
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,960
It's like this.

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,440
The father of the child is highly polluted.

75
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,160
The water is not polluted.

76
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
The child's heart rate is low.

77
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,120
The child and mother are in danger.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,880
I hoped that my father could come to help us

79
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,360
persuade the father to choose the abandoned property.

80
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,960
But the father has always hoped for a good one.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Do you have the possibility

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
to tell him that we're going in?

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,240
Yes.

84
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
The best way to do this is to

85
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,600
contact the father and his husband

86
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
to discuss the decision.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,800
You can try to contact him.

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't worry. We'll try our best.

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll go in first.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Thank you.

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,560
Thank you.

92
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,160
Please.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
What should we do?

94
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,880
Mom.

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
Mom.

96
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Where's Song Tian?

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
He's the little brother of the financial team.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,400
What's wrong?

99
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,040
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
I got a call from him.

101
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,160
How is he?

102
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,600
Why are you in such a hurry?

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,360
He's my girlfriend.

104
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Can I be in a hurry?

105
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,560
You're still going to talk to him?

106
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,760
I'm not going to talk to him.

107
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,800
No.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
I've already talked to him.

109
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,080
What's wrong?

110
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
What's wrong with him?

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
You've made it clear to me.

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
You're not giving birth yet.

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,280
If you're too old to give birth,

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
you're not good to your baby.

115
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
In the end, we might have to give birth again.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll try again.

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay.

118
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Come. Let's do this together.

119
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
Come.

120
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,400
I've liked him for a long time.

121
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
Until he's divorced,

122
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
I dare to chase after him.

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,920
I didn't expect that he's pregnant.

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,480
And that boy is not responsible.

125
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,320
But it's okay.

126
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I'll take care of him and the baby.

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm so sorry.

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I'm a little girl.

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,080
Look.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
You look so cute.

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
You look like my mom.

132
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,140
Is there anyone else that wants to talk to you?

133
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:49,760
Hurray!

134
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,960
Going on the bus.

135
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,920
I'll pick you up.

136
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
Come, here.

137
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,680
Come.

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
Don't be MICY.

139
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
You'll be fine.

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
Something is wrong with him.

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:13,960
Me?

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,080
Even if she finds out,

144
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320
we'll tell her

145
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,720
how much we love her.

146
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,320
She's not my biological daughter.

147
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,160
She's not important at all.

148
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll take care of her.

149
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,920
Okay, okay.

150
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,320
Let's go to bed now.

151
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,600
Let's go to bed next.

152
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,200
You...

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
Let's take a rest.

154
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,640
Okay.

155
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm tired.

156
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,560
Go to bed.

157
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,040
Yes.

158
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Good for you.

159
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,520
Do you want a boy or a girl?

160
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,320
Why did you ask this?

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,600
Ask her.

162
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,920
I think it's good.

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,520
By the way,

164
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Su Tian is born to be a boy or a girl?

165
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,840
Yes.

166
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,200
Ask her.

167
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,680
I'll ask her.

168
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,240
Yes.

169
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,040
Go and ask her.

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay.

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,680
Hello.

172
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,280
Su Tian.

173
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,040
What's your name?

174
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,360
My name is Huang.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
My colleague just got pregnant.

176
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,680
I think it's you.

177
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Li Kai.

178
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,920
What?

179
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,400
You're so happy.

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,160
You're so happy.

181
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
You're not happy.

182
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,960
I'm not happy.

183
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm sure you're happy.

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,000
If you're not happy,

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,600
you two are happy.

186
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll tell you what I said to Tian.

187
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,360
I'll send you a gift.

188
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Congratulations.

189
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,360
I think it's about time to go to work.

190
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Life is really hard.

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Isn't it?

192
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
Grandpa.

193
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
You can look at it now.

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
What does Mu Tu like?

195
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
Put it next to him.

196
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
He will know that you love him.

197
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,160
I will be sad.

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
Mu Tu.

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm sorry.

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
This is for you.

212
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Don't eat too much.

213
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
It will be angry.

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Do you have anything to say to Mu Tu?

215
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
If you don't,

216
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I'll send him off.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Mu Tu.

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Mu Tu, I'm afraid.

219
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Run.

220
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Run.

221
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Mu Tu, run.

222
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm afraid.

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm afraid.

224
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm afraid.

225
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
My dad and my brother were sick that day.

226
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Because he didn't let me follow him.

227
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm afraid that he will be sad at that time.

228
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Dad.

229
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Is the smoke Mu Tu?

230
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
It's black.

231
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
It should be...

232
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Mu Tu.

233
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Mu Tu.

234
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Mu Tu.

235
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Mu Tu.

236
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Mu Tu.

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
Mu Tu.

238
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
My dad left me.

239
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
where he went.

240
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,360
But I see the clouds in the sky

241
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,600
will slowly show off my father's appearance.

242
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
He's smiling.

243
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,400
I think about him.

244
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,960
He should be thinking of me.

245
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,360
We will meet one day.

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,320
They just forced us to go there.

247
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,880
Help us set up a warm home there.

248
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Being able to miss someone

249
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,120
or to remember someone

250
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,640
is a very hard thing, right?

251
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,360
Please say yes.

252
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,760
We're ready.

253
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,760
Thank you.

254
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,880
Yu Yu,

255
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
hear me out.

256
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,880
You call...

257
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Arrest me and cellphone?

258
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,760
Have you slept yet?

259
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,940
As the Weinar.

260
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,600
Help me get some pockets of the fridge.

261
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm not afraid of you.

262
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm afraid of you.

263
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm afraid of you.

264
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm afraid of you.

265
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I'm afraid of you.

266
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm afraid of you.

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
I'm afraid of you.

268
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm afraid of you.

269
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm afraid of you.

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I'm afraid of you.

271
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm afraid of you.

272
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm afraid of you.

273
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
I'm afraid of you.

274
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm afraid of you.

275
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
You're afraid of you.

276
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I'll go back to take a rest.

277
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I'll eat it together.

278
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:37,000
the respective

279
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,720
Thank you.

280
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,840
You still remember it.

281
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
Can we take a photo?

282
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,520
Can you take a photo of him?

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,040
поч 나는

284
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Yi Xin

285
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,760
Xing也...

286
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Happy birthday to you

287
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Happy birthday to you

288
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,400
Happy birthday to you

289
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's make a wish

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,200
Happy birthday to you

291
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
What do you want to say?

292
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I won't say it

293
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,200
If you don't say it, I won't help you

294
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
What do you want to say?

295
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,400
About work

296
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Okay, I thought you wanted me to be your opponent

297
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
Mr. Hong

298
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
You will wait Grindelwald

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,460
Drinked a lot of sweet

300
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,380
I'm in love...

301
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,020
in your heart

302
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:20,300
in two moments

303
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm my mind

304
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
It's you who said love

305
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
I'm going to sleep now

306
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I'll leave you alone

307
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm going to sleep

308
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Okay

309
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,300
But I want to write a letter for you

310
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Leaving you in this uncertain world

311
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,300
You are the moment I think of you

312
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,300
I'll give you a present

313
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I'll be your flower

314
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Chen'er is back

315
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,300
I'm going to sleep now

316
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Hello

317
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Chen'er, my mother is dead

318
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Are you okay?

319
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
I'm fine

320
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,300
She's old

321
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
We prepared for you

322
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
Do you have anything else?

323
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I like someone

324
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
She seems to be fine

325
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,300
You have a good heart to tell me about you

326
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm just like you

327
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Zhang Yilan

328
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Have you met someone?

329
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
You are more worried about him

330
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,300
I'm afraid he'll come back when he doesn't pick up the bull

331
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
He's back

332
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Are you serious?

333
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,300
I feel a little bit sad in front of him

334
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
I can't say anything

335
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm afraid he'll say something wrong

336
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
And he'll hit me again

337
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Su Wan, you dare not chase him

338
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
But I'm afraid he'll come back

339
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
The more you dare not chase him, the more you'll chase him

340
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Don't drag him

341
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
He'll throw the girl away

342
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,300
I think I really need to talk to him

343
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,300
You come to work overtime tonight, okay?

344
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I don't have time tonight

345
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
What are you busy with?

346
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm checking something

347
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
What's that? Tell me

348
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,300
Recently, a girl wants to date me

349
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
So I don't have time to do anything else

350
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I understand

351
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Who said that?

352
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I don't have the confidence to listen to you

353
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
I'll hang up

354
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,300
If you need anything, you can call me anytime

355
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
What if...

356
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
What if I have time?

357
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I got it

358
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm hanging up

359
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
First time

360
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm not going to be a double-decker

361
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Hello, everyone

362
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm Wei Yifan

363
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
My hobby is dancing

364
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
My name is double-decker

365
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
Because my dad

366
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
was born on that day

367
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
He was a double-decker

368
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
So I got up to be a double-decker

369
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
I see

370
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
So he was always looking for you

371
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Double-decker

372
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
Double-decker

373
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
What's wrong?

374
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Nothing

375
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
You can listen to me

376
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Double-decker

377
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
I suddenly want to date you

378
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,300
I'm in love with you

379
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Hello, Xiaoxiao

380
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Happy birthday to you

381
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Happy birthday to you

382
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Happy birthday to you

383
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Happy birthday to you

384
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Diandian, happy birthday

385
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Thank you

386
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
I've been waiting for you for the night

387
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
How about it?

388
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
Am I the first one?

389
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
Are you free tomorrow?

390
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I'll treat you to dinner

391
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Are you free now?

392
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,300
Yes

393
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Are you free tomorrow?

394
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
Why do you have to see me today?

395
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm just worried that you'll fall asleep

396
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
if you don't want to see me tonight

397
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
What's wrong?

398
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
You're so serious

399
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
It's also the first time I've met this

400
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
I'm not surprised

401
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,300
I want to be straightforward

402
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
But I'm afraid that

403
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
he might think I'm a good girl

404
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
You're talking like that

405
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Are you going to hurt anyone?

406
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
No

407
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
I want to

408
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
chase Sangya

409
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Really?

410
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Be quiet

411
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
No

412
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
You finally got it

413
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
I'll tell you when you get the chance

414
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
Really? Of course

415
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
We've known each other

416
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
I've never heard of you chasing after anyone

417
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Actually, I'm quite happy to hear this

418
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Although we're close

419
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
we've never shared our feelings

420
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Sorry

421
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,300
I just want to say something

422
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Tell me

423
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Did you have any plans for this?

424
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Because I don't have any plans

425
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,300
So I wanted to ask you

426
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
I don't like your feeling

427
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
What feeling?

428
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
I'm so passionate that you don't like it?

429
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
It's a death-saving answer

430
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
He shouldn't like

431
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
the passion

432
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,300
You can't be too passionate

433
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
But you can't be too vague

434
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
It's too hard

435
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
But I think the biggest problem is

436
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
I don't have the courage

437
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
I don't want you to say that

438
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
Who says you don't have the courage?

439
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
You never rely on your family

440
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
and you don't bring us trouble

441
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,300
You can solve everything by yourself

442
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
I think

443
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
the bravest girl in my life

444
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
is like this piece of pizza

445
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
If she doesn't pull the string

446
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
she won't like it

447
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,300
You should give her some string

448
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
to make her feel you're caring for her

449
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
She'll need you

450
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Just like a spider web

451
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
She can't run away

452
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Then you wait for her to say goodbye

453
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Really?

454
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
Yes

455
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Anyway, no matter what you decide

456
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
I wish you a victory and a victory

457
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
I want to give up everything

458
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
and not think about anything

459
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I want to be that person

460
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
I also want to work hard

461
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
to be that passionate person

462
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
I think it's okay to fail

463
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,300
I want to try it at least once

464
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,300
I want to chase Sang Yan

465
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
The light is still on

466
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
You haven't slept yet

467
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
How do you sleep?

468
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
I'll sleep a bit

469
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Well

470
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I'll give you a gift

471
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,300
when you're born

472
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
If she agrees

473
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,300
even if she wants to move out

474
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
she has a reason to talk to her

475
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Come on

476
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
And

477
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,300
69 days

478
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,560
Allbox Often Really

479
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,820
Just go

480
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
Do you think about

481
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
other people that

482
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,740
he told me

483
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
I know

484
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
I'm afraid I'll forget.

485
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Where did you come from?

486
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,580
Can you be more honest?

487
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,580
You should be honest and considerate.

488
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,580
Instead of reminding me every day,

489
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,580
I'll tell you.

490
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
I'm afraid I'll forget.

491
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,580
I...

492
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
Okay, I'll remember.

493
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
Okay, I'll remember.

494
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Then,

495
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
I'll remember you in the future.

496
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
You're a model after the second month.

497
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
You don't like it, do you?

498
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Xiao Guo is a good sister to you.

499
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
Xiao Guo is a good sister to you.

500
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,580
She can arrange these for you in the month of last.

501
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
There's no way.

502
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,580
She just wants to help me and love me.

503
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
She bought me four gold bars.

504
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
It's good for you and for my baby.

505
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
Yifan,

506
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
are you wearing perfume today?

507
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
It smells good.

508
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Really?

509
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
I feel that you're not in the right mood today.

510
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
Have you been in love lately?

511
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,580
No.

512
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,580
I've been chasing someone recently.

513
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,580
What?

514
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
You're chasing someone?

515
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,580
I didn't expect that you're also active every day.

516
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Yifan,

517
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,580
you should know that you're in such good condition.

518
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
You should look at her more.

519
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Don't be stubborn.

520
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,580
If you're not,

521
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
it's very good.

522
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
And she looks very good.

523
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
How good can she be?

524
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
She's very good.

525
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:58,500
She's a good water bottle for the

526
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,500
18-day-dress.

527
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,580
18-day-dress?

528
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
How do you feel?

529
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
Oh, this is for you.

530
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,580
No need.

531
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,580
Thank you, sister.

532
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
You're welcome.

533
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
Since the other party is so cool,

534
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,580
you can't say anything.

535
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,580
I forgot to tell you.

536
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,580
She's my roommate.

537
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,580
So we asked her what she's doing at home every day.

538
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Your roommate?

539
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,580
Well,

540
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
I hope you can be as happy as I am.

541
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Oh, my god.

542
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
No,

543
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
I have to go back to the center of the date.

544
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
This is a serious development.

545
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
I have to digest it.

546
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
Yifan,

547
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
you have your own way.

548
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
I'm telling you,

549
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
you can't lose her.

550
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
You must love her so much.

551
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
You know?

552
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
The next job is

553
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,580
Xiaogu.

554
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
You two,

555
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,580
arrange the next job.

556
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
That's it, Mr. Cao.

557
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,580
The plan for the operation of this festival

558
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
has been planned.

559
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
We may have to improve it.

560
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
We'll do it today.

561
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,580
But in this regard,

562
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
our team

563
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
is very cooperative.

564
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
I hope Mr. Cao

565
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
can give us more time.

566
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,580
Yes.

567
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
We have three plans.

568
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,580
But these three plans

569
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
are actually

570
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,580
going to the ground to try

571
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
which one is more suitable for us.

572
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,580
If you want to give her some time,

573
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
she will think that

574
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,580
you are caring for her.

575
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
She will need you.

576
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Just like a spider web.

577
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
You can't run away.

578
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
This is our planning team.

579
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,580
That is the art team.

580
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
This is the program team.

581
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Mr. Cao,

582
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
I'm sorry.

583
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
I'm sorry.

584
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
I'm sorry.

585
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,580
I'm sorry.

586
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,580
I'm sorry.

587
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,580
I'm sorry.

588
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,580
I'm sorry.

589
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,580
I'm sorry.

590
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm sorry.

591
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
I'm sorry.

594
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
Please.

595
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
There are 68 days left.

596
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
I'm not sure if I'm wrong

597
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I can't make the right choice

598
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,580
Except for you, I'm not heartbroken

599
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,580
I want to be like the sun

600
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
I'm not afraid of falling

601
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm just a little bit of heat

602
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,580
But I'm not afraid of it

603
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,580
Even if it's a big rain

604
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Even if the world is dark

605
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,580
I will be with you

606
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,580
And love is full of happiness

607
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Yes, but you are too good at talking

608
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,580
I've said this before, but I haven't said it yet

609
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
If I don't remind you

610
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
You will use the same method

611
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
To take your words as air

612
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
I'm not the one who's wrong

613
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,580
You want me to remind you every day

614
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Let's talk about the result

615
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Fine

616
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,580
So, just take a look

617
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
What do you want to eat

618
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,580
I will give you all

619
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
I have the cheap one

620
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,580
I just want to eat something

621
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,180
I have no appetite

622
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,780
You can always enjoy a meat with the best moments.

623
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,940
The only advantages I have today are for you.

624
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,820
How do you keep the roasted goose?

625
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,740
I...

626
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,320
He's waiting for me the same way as tolerate Luo mean.

627
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Will you ask what I have done?

628
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,840
Why did you suddenly sat down and tell me

629
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,800
about your crush?

630
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,120
This time you're not taking my Pi.

631
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,580
I'll stay, too.

632
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,380
Auntie, what's the matter with you?

633
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,420
Don't bring me anymore 한�クリふりに find me.

634
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,780
I'll find this nice place to sleep with you.

635
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,980
Don't talk.

636
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,020
If I keep making such a move when I was a baby,

637
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,220
I'm not afraid of you.

638
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220

Where should I hide?

665
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
I have a surprise.

666
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,420
My heart becomes transparent.

667
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I like you so much.

668
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,020
Like a flowing stream,

669
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,020
the love in the deep forest.

670
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,620
Like a spring,

671
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,820
the quietness of the unfulfilled.

672
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,420
The gift is like this.

673
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
Like a flowing stream, the love in the deep forest.

674
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
Like a flowing stream, the love in the deep forest.

675
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
I've decided not to end it.

676

I won't give up

757
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,420
You gave me courage

758
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,820
And the future I'm in

759
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,020
You opened each dream

760
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:24,140
Even if it's one-eyed

761
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,820
I don't care for it anymore

762
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,620
I want you to exist

763
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,620
Not to step over the darkness
