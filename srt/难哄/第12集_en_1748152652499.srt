1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've ever loved you.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to book a room.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You want to register the living room?

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's still a room next door.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll send it to you.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Isn't your young man's room open now?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a rule.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You must register.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I can do it myself.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then you can register the living room at night.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or do you still practice?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I should do a few moves.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't be nervous.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can do it.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're not the main judge.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you so nervous?

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm still a new worker in the art department.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think you're...

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
306.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm leaving.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you sure you don't want that room?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, thanks.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Where are you going?

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
To the living room.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's a room inside.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Who are you?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm from the front yard.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Money.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Money.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You put the money in the room?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The lights are off.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sorry.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Go to the front and take a look.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Next performance.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No. 7, I'm half-dressed.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think I haven't been this happy for a long time.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm happy now.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have my own family.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please don't come to me again.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Auntie.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If he doesn't want you to find him,

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
don't look for him.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is Yu Qin.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yu Qin?

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is Yu Qin.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll give it to you.

62
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is Shu Jin.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is his own will.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He also wants you to start your own life.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please let him go.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Have I already wash my face?

68
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,840
I don't think you'd understand.

69
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,220
Why would you think I'm not gonna harm you?

70
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,440
Looks like there's something wrong.

71
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,240
So, what are you doing?

72
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,580
Did you bring other things?

73
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
No.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,380
komun.

75
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,740
What happened?

76
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,220
Well, the first thing you walked passed by and kicked me out.

77
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
How do you know?

78
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Sister Yufan.

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
After you finish editing, you will come to my party.

80
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Not necessarily. Let's see the situation later.

81
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,480
But I'm looking forward to it.

82
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Sister, are you still not done? Everyone is gone.

83
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Yes, sister. Our party, you must come. Please.

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Let's go. Sister Su Tian has already passed away. She's waiting for you.

85
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Come.

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Okay, I'll try my best later. Okay?

87
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Okay. I'll wait for you.

88
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Let's go, Mu Chengyuan. Hurry up.

89
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
See you tonight.

90
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Hurry up.

91
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Look at you. You still want to sleep?

92
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Dad, I've already sent it to you.

93
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Yufan.

94
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Director Dan, you're not leaving yet?

95
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I just finished my meeting with them. Let's go to the party together.

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm not going. I'm going home first.

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Bye-bye.

98
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Yufan.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
What's wrong?

100
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,480
We don't look like a day and night.

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,480
If anyone harasses you, you must tell me.

102
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I will never let her live a good life.

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
No.

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,480
That's good. I'm just worried that you won't go to the party.

105
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Is there any other reason?

106
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Really?

107
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
At the same time, we should be more friendly.

108
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Everyone is very nice.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
There's no reason not to go.

110
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Okay, go get the bag. I'll drive you home.

111
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Okay.

112
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Hello, we have a reservation.

113
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Miss Wen, your friends are in the second floor. I'll take you there.

114
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
You're here.

115
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
This way.

116
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
You can see them when you go up.

117
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Thank you.

118
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
You're here.

119
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Come on, come on.

120
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Sit down.

121
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
I'll drive you home.

122
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Thank you.

123
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
No, I'll drive you home.

124
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Thank you.

125
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Everyone, today we're here to welcome two new classmates.

126
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,480
You two, don't be nervous in our place.

127
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Just take it as your home.

128
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Also, everyone has worked hard during this time.

129
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Let's drink tonight.

130
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's eat. I'll buy the eggs.

131
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Let's drink.

132
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
Let's drink.

133
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Come on.

134
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Let's go.

135
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Boss, why are you here again?

136
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
You're tired from work the other day.

137
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
You can relax if you have us here.

138
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
You're welcome.

139
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Boss, what do you want? I'll order some noodles.

140
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll drive you home.

141
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,480
By the way, you can go to the restaurant if you're hungry.

142
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
The restaurant is open.

143
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
You can come in if you want.

144
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
You can come in.

147
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
I'll be back in a moment.

148
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'll be back in a moment.

149
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Okay.

150
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Boss,

151
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I'll be back in a moment.

152
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
I'll be back in a moment.

153
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Boss,

154
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Boss,

156
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Boss,

158
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Boss,

160
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Boss,

162
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Boss,

164
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,200
Who?

166
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
That...

167
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
...murderer.

168
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,080
Who?

169
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,840
Here.

170
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
Let me show you my idol.

171
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,880
The little girl is so timid.

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm very timid.

173
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,640
I wish you could be like this.

174
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,120
Isn't this the senior of Sang Yan?

175
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
Senior?

176
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,960
He's also from our school.

177
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,600
Yes.

178
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,440
He and my senior are from the same class.

179
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,560
So when they went to the graduation ceremony,

180
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,440
I went there too.

181
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,040
So...

182
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
After the meal,

183
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,840
did something happen?

184
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
No.

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,960
But I do remember it.

186
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,680
Because they went to the graduation ceremony,

187
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,240
they would drink a little bit of wine.

188
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
Except for the two computer-based

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,280
fans,

190
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,160
Senior Sang Yan and Senior Duan Jia Xu.

191
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
One doesn't stick to the bottom.

192
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,880
The other changes the color of the mask and is used for 19.

193
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
For 19?

194
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,480
Who's used it?

195
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,400
Senior Sang Yan.

196
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,060
Xiao Yubo.

197
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,440
Are you alright?

198
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Let go of my hand.

199
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
What about you?

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm a senior.

201
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm not a senior.

202
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm a big student.

203
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,320
Can you be gentle to me?

204
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
Wei Fan.

205
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,520
Stand up.

206
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
Help me.

207
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,720
Open the door.

208
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Do you want to help me?

209
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,520
I'm not a senior.

210
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
You're a senior.

211
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,520
You're a senior.

212
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
I can't take care of my blood.

213
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,920
Wei Fan.

214
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,920
Come up and sit.

215
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
I'm leaving.

216
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Sit at my home.

217
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,520
Come here.

218
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,520
Sit.

219
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Come here.

220
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,320
Where are you going?

221
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
To Wu Da Xue.

222
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,320
I'm here.

223
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,920
Come and wait for me.

224
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Come on. Get up.

226
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm a senior.

227
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
I can walk by myself.

228
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,320
All right.

229
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
You're an actor.

230
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,320
You play so long.

231
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,120
What?

232
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You're the one who plays.

233
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I've used it 800 years ago.

234
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,920
I can't play it.

235
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,320
Wait for me here.

236
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Wait for me to carry you.

237
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
Be safe.

238
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Be safe.

239
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,920
He seems...

240
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:55,920
He's pretending.

241
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,920
You can't see him.

242
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
You're leaving too?

243
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,920
Director An invited us to dinner.

244
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Didn't Su Fang An say you still have night time?

245
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm not interested.

246
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
I'm leaving.

247
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Take care.

248
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm leaving.

249
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,520
I'm leaving.

250
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,320
Be safe.

251
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:34,920
I'm leaving.

252
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,520
I'm leaving.

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,120
I'm leaving.

254
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,720
I'm leaving.

255
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,320
I'm leaving.

256
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:37,920
I'm leaving.

257
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm leaving.

258
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,120
I'm leaving.

259
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,720
I'm leaving.

260
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm leaving.

261
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm leaving.

262
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
Huh?

263
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh.

264
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Maybe we shouldn't waste our time.

265
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
It's a bit impossible

266
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,720
because of the слова and lyrics.

267
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,340
But myыв

268
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,120
we're going to defeated it in future.

269
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,320
Let's really stop here.

270
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:54,720
Go.

271
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,080
And take care of her.

272
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,520
Pray for snacks.

273
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,220
Su Fang An

274
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
I will help you leave.

275
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,920
You go out for lunch.

276
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Or I can't make enough time for lunch.

277
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,680
Let's go.

278
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,040
Go home.

279
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,480
Why do you want to drink?

280
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,720
I thought it was a drink.

281
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
I just want to drink it.

282
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,080
Then can you do it?

283
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
It's okay. You can go.

284
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll go with you.

285
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,880
You can go.

286
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,200
Why don't you sit here and wake up?

287
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,600
I...

288
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
Please sit here and wake up.

289
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,640
Can you rest here?

290
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,360
It's okay. It's okay.

291
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,480
It's okay.

292
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,440
My dad can't drink.

293
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
I can't.

294
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,000
You...

295
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
Are you okay?

296
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,880
I can't stand it.

297
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,200
You...

298
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I can't stand it.

299
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,960
I can't stand it.

300
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,240
I can't stand it.

301
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,040
One, two, three.

302
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,480
Can you do it?

303
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,400
I can.

304
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
I can't stand it.

305
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,040
I'll hold it.

306
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,040
Isn't it the same to put it on?

307
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,600
It's okay.

308
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,840
You...

309
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
It's not comfortable.

310
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,280
Is it okay?

311
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
Okay. Then you...

312
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,800
I'll hold it.

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,240
You can't hold it.

314
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,640
It's okay. You can do it.

315
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,560
I can't stand it.

316
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,880
Is it okay?

317
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
Can you do it?

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,560
I can.

319
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,680
I can do it.

320
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,880
I can do it.

321
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,800
Are you laughing?

322
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,680
No.

323
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm not.

324
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,640
You're laughing at me.

325
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,000
No thanks.

326
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:10,880
Bro are you glad?

327
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,640
Yes.

328
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,520
What?

329
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,560
Sorry.

330
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
Sorry for the wrong answer.

331
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,120
Forget it.

332
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,040
Great sister

333
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,200
That's why I think

334
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
Miss Sa is crazy.

335
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Nothing is crazy.

336
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
No.

337
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,600
No?

338
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
No.

339
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,400
Never.

340
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Never.

341
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
No.

342
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Don't be so silly

343
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,240
to one another.

344
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,400
Alright.

345
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,880
What gift for this time?

346
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,120
Thank you.

347
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I thought you said you can do it.

348
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
Yes.

349
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Yes.

350
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I'll give you a massage.

351
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I'm leaving.

352
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll be back.

353
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
You want to chase me?

354
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
What?

355
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
If you mean that,

356
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
you can just go straight.

357
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Maybe I can still run.

358
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Not yet.

359
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,040
I have to tell you.

360
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm going to sleep.

361
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Where are you going?

362
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
Sit down.

363
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I'll be back.

364
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Don't drink so much anymore.

365
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I'll drink the tea and drink the wine

366
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
when I graduate.

367
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
How do you know?

368
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Why do I drink so much?

369
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Goodbye.

370
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
Goodbye.

371
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm going to sleep.

372
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I've been going for so long.

373
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Can't you wake up?

374
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I'm going to sleep.

375
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Chen Jing.

376
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Come on.

377
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Drink the honey water.

378
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
No.

379
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm not drinking.

380
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Drink it.

381
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
Listen to me.

382
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Come on.

383
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Drink it and your body will be warm.

384
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Don't be cold.

385
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Drink it and go back to sleep.

386
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Thank you, San Yan.

387
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,040
If you still have a taste of life,

388
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
just stay here

389
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
for a while longer.

390
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
The only two computer computers

391
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
that I read are the wind and cloud characters.

392
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Senior Sang Yan and Senior Duan Jia Xu.

393
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
One is the 9th grade.

394
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
The other is the 10th grade.

395
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
The 10th grade?

396
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Who is the winner?

397
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Senior Sang Yan.

398
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
But I can't tell you.

399
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
I'm not sure.

400
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
I'm not sure.

401
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm not sure.

402
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,040
I'm not sure.

403
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
I'm not sure.

404
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I'm not sure.

405
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
I'm not sure.

406
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I'm not sure.

407
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm not sure.

408
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
I'm not sure.

409
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm not sure.

410
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,040
But he does look

411
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
really bad that day.

412
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
He's drinking alone.

413
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
He doesn't say anything.

414
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
He can't hear anything.

415
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
San Yan.

416
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
Am I not good to you?

417
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I'll treat you well

418
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
from now on.

419
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Okay?

420
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Nowadays.

421
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Today.

422
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
can't you be emotional?

423
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Would you love to be emotional too.

424
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
How can I say it's possible?

425
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Looks like the movie is heated.

426
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Have some water.

427
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
I can't.

428
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I think

429
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
you have his side at the moment.

430
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Let's talk.

431
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,880
so Hertz can also mature.

432
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,140
This step

433
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,420
only causes its р sex.

434
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,080
me.

435
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,600
Don't you have any other advantages?

436
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
Sang Yan,

437
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,920
I hate myself.

438
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,420
I want to share my feelings with you every time.

439
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,300
I just wanted to do it.

440
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,180
Stop.

441
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,260
Back then, it was like making a astronomical argument.

442
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,600
Okay,

443
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,420
Just you wait

444
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
I'm not afraid of you.

445
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm not afraid of you.

446
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
I'm not afraid of you.

447
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm not afraid of you.

448
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
I'm not afraid of you.

449
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm not afraid of you.

450
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
I'm not afraid of you.

451
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
I'm not afraid of you.

452
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
I'm not afraid of you.

453
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
I'm not afraid of you.

454
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm not afraid of you.

455
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm not afraid of you.

456
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm not afraid of you.

457
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm not afraid of you.

458
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm not afraid of you.

459
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
The computer has not been했 enough.

460
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
The Internet doesn't support yourように.

461
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm not afraid of you.

462
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I'm not afraid of you.

463
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
I'm not afraid of you,

464
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I'm not afraid of you.

465
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
I am afraid of my own family.

466
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
I am afraid of Court's order.

467
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
You wronged me.

468
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,380
their marriage in advance through the age of fruit and water

469
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,060
Today I wolfed away this hour

470
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,060
I'll take such a long time today.

471
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,060
What did I do for you?

472
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm really pretending to be a dreamer and I'm not drunk anymore.

473
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
I'm really a cheap drunk.

474
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,060
How could I help him?

475
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,060
I'm drunk.

476
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,060
I'm drunk.

477
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,060
I'm drunk.

478
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,060
I won't drink anymore.

479
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Even if I drink, I can't borrow a drink to pretend to be crazy.

480
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
If you want to borrow,

481
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,060
I hope you can use this wine to apologize to me.

482
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,060
It's not that you should

483
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,060
put this on me because it's cheap.

484
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,060
You can't let me be caught in this black pot.

485
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
Go to sleep.

486
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
It's good to sleep.

487
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
I have a habit.

488
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Go to sleep.

489
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Have company.

490
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Sorry, sorry.

491
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Seems like I don't have oil today.

492
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,060
Nothing urgent?

493
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Yeah.

494
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,060
Well...

495
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,060
It's quite a tight fit.

496
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,500
Sorry.

497
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,620
How many times have I done this?

498
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,100
Why...

499
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,580
Why are you so stubborn?

500
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,420
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,540
I...

502
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,980
You were quite arrogant before.

503
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,140
When I mentioned this,

504
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,540
I was so polite.

505
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,060
I was so careless.

506
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,500
I said it and you said it.

507
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
In the end, I wanted to make money.

508
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,580
It's your turn.

509
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
How about...

510
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,220
when you try to

511
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,420
lock yourself in the room

512
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,740
in the evening?

513
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,380
Don't go out.

514
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,220
We're having a long day.

515
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,500
You locked the door.

516
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,220
I can't go in your room.

517
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,020
You're quite special.

518
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,700
You even have a cheap冒兵.

519
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I used to...

520
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,020
I wouldn't...

521
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,820
I don't know.

522
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,500
So...

523
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,740
you only took advantage of me?

524
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,340
Or are you...

525
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,300
what's this?

526
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,500
What's this?

527
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,340
Are you a celebrity?

528
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,740
I'm a little suspicious of you now.

529
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,380
Are you really a friend?

530
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
I'm really a friend now.

531
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,660
Right.

532
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,500
Oh, right.

533
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,620
Are you sure?

534
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,060
I'm just curious.

535
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm serious, isn't it?

536
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,680
It's not

537
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,180
Why are you buying me the lollipop?

538
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,020
Why?

539
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,460
I'll eat it.

540
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,940
Isn't it sharp?

541
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,540
Wasn't that too many mistakes?

542
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,460
Right, it's all the港.

543
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,140
Bo Meng was the one domens.

544
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
No,ucks.

545
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,180
What?

546
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,340
Hey away from the food.

547
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Okay...

548
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,260
Between those two choices who are so These two middle class girls myself

549
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,540
Her name is

550
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,100
I've asked Juan to asmış every year

551
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,460
Is Far yourself

552
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,260
Won't you let me handle it?

553
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,380
Damn you

554
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,060
I'm going to the hotel to have a meeting.

555
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,580
I'll be in the mall.

556
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,340
Thank you.

557
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,620
You're not feeling well?

558
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,620
No.

559
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,100
You're dreaming.

560
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,460
You've finished your work.

561
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,300
I was so enthusiastic

562
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,100
when I was wearing my clothes last night.

563
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,740
When did I wear your clothes?

564
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,780
You don't know?

565
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,060
I forgot.

566
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,380
You said that

567
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,340
and I forgot.

568
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,620
I might have remembered it wrongly.

569
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,500
Last time.

570
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,180
After all, it's not a couple of times.

571
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,020
You can't remember it so clearly every time.

572
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,980
I'll go to the hospital

573
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,420
when I have time.

574
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,980
I'm sorry.

575
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,060
Thank you.

576
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,540
Take care.

577
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,820
Wei Zan.

578
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,460
You have something on your head.

579
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,660
What's that?

580
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,260
Left.

581
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,940
It's not left.

582
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,700
Right.

583
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,260
You can't see it

584
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,620
from the back.

585
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,780
Come here.

586
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,420
Come here.

587
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,940
It's done.

588
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,140
What's that?

589
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,060
I don't know.

590
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,300
Don't play with it.

591
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,060
Hurry up.

592
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,860
I'll go to the hospital.

593
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,460
Good morning, Yifan.

594
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,060
Morning.

595
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,020
Yifan.

596
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,740
What's wrong?

597
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,460
Are you and Sang Yan's senior

598
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,260
in the church?

599
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,100
No.

600
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,060
I saw him sending you to work

601
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,540
and he's still shaking your head.

602
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,660
So I thought

603
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,820
you'd be fine.

604
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,180
Is it garlic?

605
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,700
Miss.

606
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,460
Miss.

607
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
I've got your bag.

608
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,100
Mine?

609
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,540
Yes.

610
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,740
I'll get it.

611
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,260
Thank you.

612
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,780
It's okay.

613
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:14,900
Let's go.

614
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,700
Hit him?

615
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,700
No.

616
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:17,980
Thank you.

617
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,700
It's okay.

618
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,500
It's okay.

619
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,340
Take it easy.

620
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,300
Morning, Fang Li.

621
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,620
Morning, Fang Li.

622
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Morning.

623
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,500
Morning.

624
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,300
Morning.

625
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,220
Put it here.

626
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,900
Okay.

627
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,540
Thank you.

628
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,500
What's the situation?

629
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,140
I don't know.

630
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,300
All of them are in their work.

631
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,140
Not all together.

632
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,020
We're all here.

633
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,220
But we still need them.

634
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,780
What else?

635
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,540
You want me to help and I'm here at the same time.

636
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,140
As long as your yen is worth the change,

637
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,800
I would definitely market my investment in the product.

638
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,580
I would definitely won't be Inspecting the Fitness Guide.

639
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,740
Thank you so much.

640
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,300
For your money,

641
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,100
I will buy a long belly.

642
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,160
Thanks to him,

643
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,000
I won't have to shout about being awww.

644
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,060
What's going on here?

645
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,900
Sorry, I'm fine now.

646
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,740
Don't thank me.

647
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,140
I don't know if it's worth it.

648
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,340
You can try it first.

649
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,220
Bye.

650
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,020
Okay.

651
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,780
Sister Tian Fan, you're finally back.

652
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,020
Why are you here?

653
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,940
Well,

654
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,900
didn't Sister Tian Fan say

655
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,740
you had a bad luck with that?

656
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,300
I just wanted to move out of school.

657
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,100
So I want to see

658
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,420
your original house.

659
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,220
That's not good.

660
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,740
But I'm here.

661
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,580
I know it's a long way to go,

662
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,460
but I promise

663
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,660
I won't delay too long.

664
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,780
But...

665
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,700
Why didn't you tell me?

666
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,940
Why are you so early today?

667
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,060
I'm going to school.

668
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,820
I'll be back.

669
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,020
Don't you want to come?

670
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,940
Thank you.

671
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,500
Here,

672
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Come here.

673
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Okay.

674
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
Go to the hospital.

675
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
You go first.

676
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Okay.

677
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Okay.

678
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Okay.

679
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Okay.

680
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Okay.
