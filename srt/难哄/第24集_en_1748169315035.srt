1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that ...

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Grasp

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 43

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why were we never seen each other?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I starved as an actor at a theater.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Were you in a university?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Yes.

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
You were good.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right then.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are the two of us in a series?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Should be.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
What specific major are sibling graduates?

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,000
So, we'll choose mechanical major, okay?

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's great.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll go to the podium for a shower first.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To change in the strip in a moment.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We have to start the biggerelichenlateral .

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Pulled into my right hand, over the馬 Ludariat, another on my right hand.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Thank you.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,000
See you.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Then, tonight,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,960
Sixth Brother, you two.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,160
What are you doing?

38
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Who was that girl?

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
Was it our classmate?

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Why didn't I remember our classmate?

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
I found her so late.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,760
It must not be our classmate.

43
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,960
She's from the next door.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
She's taking her to the bathroom.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
Why didn't she ask me

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
how I'm doing?

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,640
It's so painful.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm going to the bathroom.

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Sit down.

50
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
What?

51
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,640
You're so fast.

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,800
You're so hardworking.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Why did you run away?

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,400
Why did you say that?

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,120
It's so hard.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
You're so lazy.

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
You've been working so hard.

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
Did you have a hard time?

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Don't.

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm so tired.

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
I heard that

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,560
many of our graduates

63
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,240
have a hard time finding jobs.

64
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,560
Are you scared?

65
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,040
It's not like three years ago.

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
I just found a job

67
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,960
in a game studio in Nanwu.

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm happy and relaxed.

69
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Didn't I tell them

70
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,640
that I can't find them?

71
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,520
Yes.

72
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
Just like your ex-girlfriend.

73
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,960
She came to ask for help from a big team.

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,240
I didn't see her.

75
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,160
You promised me.

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Sorry.

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,520
Did I disturb you?

78
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm a reporter of the Daily Daily.

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,200
I saw you just now.

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,600
You must be from the school.

81
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,720
Our newspaper is right next to you.

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,440
I think you're

83
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
a graduate or just graduated.

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
You're a graduate?

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
That's great.

86
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
I'm making a choice now.

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,960
I'm going to be a student.

88
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to be a student.

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going to be a student.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm going to be a student.

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
I'm going to be a student.

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm making a choice now.

93
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,040
Then the content is

94
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,240
why young people

95
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,600
don't want to work in the opposite direction.

96
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Can I use this topic

97
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,520
to punish you?

98
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,280
You don't want to go home.

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,160
You must have a reason to not go home.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,680
Can I say more?

101
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,440
For example,

102
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,560
what's your reason?

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm sorry to disturb you.

104
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,920
Hello.

105
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,760
Jian.

106
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
You're all graduated.

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
You're back to Nanwu, aren't you?

108
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,240
Your uncle

109
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
said he would invite you to dinner.

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Thank you.

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,480
I'll stay in Yihe.

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,160
Why?

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,440
I miss you so much.

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
If you come back,

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,080
I can see you often.

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
Miss me?

117
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,240
You've only been to my school for four years.

118
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,360
Or you're with Zheng Kejia

119
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,440
and you're with him when you're traveling?

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
I don't want to go back to Nanwu.

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
I don't want to go back to Beiyu either.

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,400
And

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,360
why don't you know

124
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,320
why I left?

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm back!

126
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,880
Are you back?

127
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
The team is dead.

128
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Just a boor.

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm not afraid of the rain.

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm working.

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
It's so tiring these days.

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I can't get up and rest.

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm not afraid of the rain.

134
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm working.

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I'm working.

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm working.

137
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm working.

138
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
I'm working.

139
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm working.

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm working.

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm working.

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
What's wrong?

143
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
When can I go to the hospital?

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
My sister is not home.

145
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
She said that there's a male friend here.

146
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
So she heard.

147
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
She can't go in.

148
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Let me do some research.

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Don't lie.

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
I'll go to the gym.

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
When?

152
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
In the past two days.

153
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,120
If there's nothing else, I'll come back in advance.

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
It's good to go to see Zhizhi.

155
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
She's a little girl.

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Don't worry.

157
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Don't fight.

158
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Let me help you clean the hotel.

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll take care of it.

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Go ahead. Don't be too busy.

161
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
And...

162
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Next time, you can stay here.

163
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,120
But the best thing is to call me.

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
You're not drunk?

166
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Is there something wrong?

167
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
No.

168
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Are you okay?

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
But I think

172
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
you're too much.

173
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm just a little tired.

174
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Then go to bed early.

175
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,120
You're not going to force me?

176
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I...

177
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
No matter where you are, I can find you.

178
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Why?

179
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
No matter what,

180
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
I'll take care of it.

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Who can take away the things from me?

182
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
You're here so early.

184
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Zhizhi hasn't started yet.

185
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Are you cool?

186
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I'll stay with you.

187
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
I'll leave when I can.

188
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
You haven't been there for a long time.

189
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I thought you'd be more careful.

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
You're more careful.

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I can't.

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
I think I can go straight.

194
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
I have to cut the boarding fee.

195
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Okay, I'll take you there.

196
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Come with me to the house.

197
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
I'll be there.

198
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,120
I won't miss you.

199
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
I'm leaving.

200
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm leaving.

201
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I'm going home.

202
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
This is...

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
my home.

204
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,120
This is my home.

205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,260
Let's start.

206
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,960
Okay.

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,520
I will go with you

208
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,140
to see

209
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,380
your girls.

210
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,840
I moved off

211
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,020
to make sure

212
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,380
they didn't harm you.

213
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,180
Ziwen,

214
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,260
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,560
Right.

217
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,900
Right.

218
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,140
We förнутьсяnat till terminal 30.

219
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
If you are crying,

220
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,660
just hold on and go assured.

221
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,160
We are going구� autour,

222
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I've decided to help me with the entry.

223
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
I'll try to fix it now, okay?

224
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Okay.

225
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
So many cats. When will they smell?

226
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Jingjian.

227
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Jingjian.

228
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Jingjian.

229
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Jingjian.

230
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Su Huan.

231
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Why do I feel a little weird?

232
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Here.

233
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Come here.

234
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
He told me he had to work two days out.

235
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,160
The wardrobe is empty, and the dressing room is empty, too.

236
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Hello.

237
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,160
The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

238
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
What should I do? He's not on the phone.

239
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Let's talk.

240
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Stop! Stop!

241
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Get in. Hurry.

242
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Su Huan.

243
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Su Huan.

244
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
He's not back yet.

245
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Why is he flying so fast?

246
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I think his room is very empty.

247
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
I feel very anxious.

248
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Did he go back to his mother's house?

249
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
No.

250
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Su Huan.

251
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
Su Huan.

252
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I...

253
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm not qualified to let you forgive me for being ungrateful.

254
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm still the same as before.

255
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I don't accept your understanding.

256
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
But I also believe that I have the necessary reason to change.

257
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm young and innocent.

258
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I hope you can be safe and sound in the future.

259
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Shuang Jiang.

260
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
I'm just happy.

261
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Shuang Jiang.

262
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
What's the relationship between you and Wang Yifan?

263
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
What about Wang Yifan?

264
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Before he left, did anything happen to you?

265
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
No.

266
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
What's the difference between you and him?

267
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
For example, he's in love with you.

268
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
He's in love with you.

269
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,160
No.

270
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
Then he just left this letter and disappeared?

271
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
No.

272
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
He's gone.

273
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
He's gone.

274
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
He's gone.

275
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
He just left this letter and disappeared?

276
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
You can try to contact his family.

277
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
I don't have any contact information.

278
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
We'll help you contact his family.

279
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
You can sit over there and wait.

280
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
You can sit over there and wait.

281
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Thank you.

282
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
We just contacted Wang Yifan's mother, Miss Zhao Yuan Dong.

283
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
She told us that she doesn't really know your relationship.

284
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Second, Wang Yifan often disappears.

285
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
She hasn't fought with him recently.

286
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
So she thinks that this time she's his daughter.

287
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
She's in love with him.

288
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
His mother doesn't fight with him at all.

289
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Hearing his tone is so interesting.

290
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,160
We also found out that his father is dead.

291
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
He doesn't have any siblings.

292
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
According to your knowledge,

293
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,160
he's still a little bit older than his father.

294
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,160
He's still a little bit older than his father.

295
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,160
He's still a little bit older than his father.

296
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
He's still a little bit older than his father.

297
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
He's not a little bit older than his brother.

298
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
According to your knowledge,

299
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
does Wang Yifan have a closer family?

300
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,160
He just has friends.

301
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
He has a good friend.

302
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
But he doesn't know that Wang Yifan is strong.

303
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,160
We often see this kind of situation.

304
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Just like Wang Yifan, he's still young.

305
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Maybe he doesn't have any close relationship.

306
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,180
I told him that it's a cheat!

307
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
If they don't find out about me,

308
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,520
they can't try to pick up something unbelievable.

309
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,880
abstention from them must be 100 thousand.

310
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,300
It's a small thing.

311
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,920
Either way,

312
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,860
keep it in the contact service.

313
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,420
We have all our news for you.

314
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,420
and just sign the documents

315
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Please understand

316
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Xiao Wo

317
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I think

318
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
boys should be more open

319
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,420
Do you really have no money?

320
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I'm sorry

321
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
Wei Yifan

322
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
Where are you?

323
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Drink some

324
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
No need

325
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420
Don't be anxious

326
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
Maybe one day

327
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
he will come back

328
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,420
Yes

329
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Maybe one day

330
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
maybe four or five years later

331
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
I can't believe

332
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,420
he can hold on to this phone all the time

333
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,420
and make a big difference

334
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Actually, so many years

335
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
we don't know

336
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
what he has experienced

337
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
I suddenly realized

338
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
he is already

339
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
a family member

340
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,420
We are all his family

341
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I hope he can do this

342
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Hello, sister

343
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
How are you?

344
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
How are you?

345
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
I'm fine

346
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
I'll take this bag

347
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
and take it

348
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
There is also a bag

349
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Take it

350
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
What do you want?

351
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,420
No.8

352
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,420
No.8

353
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Okay, I'll take it

354
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
Maybe I didn't let him

355
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,420
didn't let him trust me

356
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
so he can have the money

357
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
before he can go back

358
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,420
Last night

359
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,420
he asked me to leave tomorrow

360
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
I hope I can

361
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,420
find him

362
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I'll go back to the hotel

363
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,420
Hello

364
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
I just booked the first room

365
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
You want to stay in Changzhou?

366
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
You have a wife anyway

367
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Wait

368
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,420
I'll come back on the next day

369
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
This is for you

370
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Thank you

371
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,420
I'm just curious

372
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,420
I'm just curious

373
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,420
Until I get angry

374
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,420
A brave self-love

375
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,420
I'm just curious

376
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,420
I'm just curious

377
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,420
I'm just curious

378
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,420
I'm just curious

379
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,420
I'm just curious

380
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,420
I used to live with his grandma for a while

381
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
I remember I went there once

382
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,420
He loves my dad so much

383
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,420
So he loves me too

384
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Maybe that time was the happiest time for his dad

385
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm just curious

386
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Two

387
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm just curious

388
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Come on

389
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,420
It's getting better and better

390
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,420
I'm just curious

391
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,420
Grandma, is this the 72nd road to the sea?

392
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Yes

393
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
Do you know Wen Yifan?

394
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
I've lived here for seven or eight years

395
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,420
I haven't heard of her

396
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420
Have you seen a girl who has been born?

397
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
No

398
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Thank you

399
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Will you leave me?

400
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
Is it Sang Yan?

401
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
I'm Xu Xinqing

402
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,420
I'm Wen Yifan's roommate

403
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Sorry, I'm in trouble

404
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Wen Yifan is not very popular in the university

405
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,420
She doesn't like to talk

406
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,420
She seems to be very resistant to work in her hometown

407
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,420
So she went to the Japanese newspaper

408
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Did she say why she didn't want to go home?

409
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Anyway, since she went to college

410
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Han Shu's family is still in school

411
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,420
We're quite strange

412
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,420
She didn't say anything

413
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Thank you

414
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,420
What about her work in the Japanese newspaper?

415
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
To be honest

416
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,420
We didn't have much contact after the internship

417
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,420
So I don't know much about her

418
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
Thank you

419
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
I'm sorry

420
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
I'm sorry

421
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
I'm sorry

422
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
I'm sorry

423
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Thank you

424
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
Wen Yifan?

425
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
I remember

426
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
She's so special

427
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
How could I not remember?

428
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,420
What happened then?

429
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
What's your relationship with Wen Yifan?

430
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,420
I was single

431
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,420
I can only tell you that the workplace is in a mess

432
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
But I didn't get it

433
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,420
The editor-in-chief of the time

434
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
was fired because of this

435
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
We've tried our best to help her

436
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
to get back her reputation

437
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
But she's still not satisfied

438
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
She's fired

439
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Let's avoid it

440
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
Young people are more stressed now

441
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
What's this?

442
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
If Wen Yifan were your girlfriend

443
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Would you let her continue to be important?

444
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
Please accept this

445
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Nanwu

446
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Yihe

447
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
You're not involved in this

448
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
You can't find any answers

449
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
You know

450
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,420
I'm a familiar person

451
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
But even now

452
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
you're too nice

453
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Now

454
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
there's only one place left

455
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I'm not a good person.

456
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I'm not a good person.

457
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm not a good person.

458
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm not a good person.

459
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm not a good person.

460
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm not a good person.

461
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm not a good person.

462
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm not a good person.

463
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
I'm not a good person.

464
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
I'm not a good person.

465
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
I'm not a good person.

466
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
I'm not a good person.

467
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I'm not a good person.

468
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
I'm not a good person.

469
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
I'm not a good person.

470
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,420
I hear my mom say

471
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
that Wei Fan ran away again.

472
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
why did he run away

473
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,420
I remember he was urgent at that time.

474
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
he didn't do anything

475
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
he ran away all of a sudden

476
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
He didn't do anything.

477
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
He didn't come back.

478
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,380
What's the reason?

479
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,260
He didn't tell you.

480
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,220
I was busy with the exam.

481
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
I don't know anything.

482
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,340
Do you want to ask others?

483
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,740
When did your family come back?

484
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,420
My mom and uncle moved to Nanwu.

485
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,220
They moved to Nanwu?

486
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Yes.

487
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,220
Where are they?

488
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,900
I said you should ask Wei Fan's mom directly.

489
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,700
I really don't know anything.

490
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,020
Okay.

491
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,060
Can I have a look at his old residence?

492
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:08,940
Okay.

493
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,100
This is his old residence.

494
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,180
How are you feeling?

495
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,140
Are you having a good time?

496
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,140
I'm home.

497
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,500
You're still going to go back to the old residence?

498
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
You can sit down.

499
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,140
I'll go pack my things.

500
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Get up.

501
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,140
Xiao Fan, you're off to take a seat at home.

502
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,940
Yes.

503
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,220
They're so lovely.

504
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,100
Why this child loses her cooking?

505
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,380
Xiao Fan, be careful.

506
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,220
Keep it up.

507
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:47,100
Choice

508
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,520
I'll go to find you tomorrow

509
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,200
I'll go to the mastering station

510
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,580
You don't have to be there

511
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,660
When will they arrive?

512
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,620
when we arrive at the qualification paper?

513
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,260
Love is as precious as SHU

514
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,080
My tears escape

515
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,300
Unforgettable

516
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,240
Stand right there.

517
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,540
Come on.

518
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,540
You said your mom lives in the 7th floor, right?

519
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Okay. Thank you.

520
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:15,540
The End

521
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,540
Brother, Brother San Yan.

522
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,540
I'm here to see you.

523
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Really?

524
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
What?

525
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Yes.

526
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
Yifan resigned. Don't you know?

527
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
So...

528
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,540
Did he resign because you two are close friends?

529
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Please help me to bring him a good one.

530
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Deputy Chief,

531
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,540
when did that person come here to be a security guard?

532
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,540
You...

533
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,540
He came here for a month.

534
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
What's wrong?

535
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Nothing.

536
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Then I'll leave first.

537
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
I don't want to be late.

538
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Tell Yifan that we're close recently.

539
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
And then...

540
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Congratulations.

541
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Here.

542
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,540
Take it back.

543
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,540
The End

544
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Don't be sad.

545
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,540
He said I can understand when he didn't say he was going to college.

546
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
We were kids then.

547
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
He didn't trust me.

548
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
But we've grown up now.

549
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Am I not a very good friend?

550
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
Actually,

551
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
everyone thinks that

552
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I'm a good friend.

553
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Everyone has something to say.

554
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
Don't be too self-conscious.

555
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,540
I just want to help him.

556
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,540
He's become a person now.

557
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
He has to be very lonely.

558
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Hello.

559
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
Hello, Qiao Qiao.

560
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Dian Dian, where are you?

561
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
We've been looking for you everywhere.

562
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
I'm sorry.

563
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
I'm worried about you.

564
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,540
What happened?

565
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
Are you going to never come back?

566
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
You left me that year.

567
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,540
I spent a long time to get used to it.

568
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
I worked hard to get there.

569
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
Then I worked hard to get there.

570
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,540
I was so busy that I didn't seem to be that lonely.

571
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
Even if you don't think for me,

572
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
you have to think for Sang Yan.

573
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
You just got together.

574
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
Is he okay?

575
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
No.

576
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Didn't you always say that he was so serious?

577
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
He always had a lot of anger.

578
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,540
Now he's gone.

579
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Tell me where you are.

580
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
He's almost gone mad looking for you.

581
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
I'm sorry.

582
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Dian Dian, I'm begging you.

583
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Come back soon.

584
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Qiao Qiao.

585
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,540
I'm calling you to tell you that I'm safe.

586
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
Don't worry about it.

587
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,540
I don't want to say goodbye.

588
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
I just hope that you'll be fine.

589
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
I know.

590
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
It's not because I'm not safe.

591
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Take care.

592
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
I'm sorry.

594
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,540
Is this the home order?

595
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
No, thanks.

596
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,540
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,540
I'm sorry.

598
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
I'm sorry.

599
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,540
I'm sorry.

600
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,540
I'm sorry.

601
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
I'm sorry.

602
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm sorry.
