00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The world is full of people, you are the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,480
You are here

5
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,240
They said that they were medium hot pot in Suzhou tonight

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,640
Why did you eat it?

7
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,960
I told them to bring it to you

8
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not gonna be anywhere

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
Thank you

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,420
I am going to tell you what good things will come up.

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,760
Hold on.

12
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,620
Are you from Yi He- Da?

13
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,160
Yes.

14
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,720
What happened to him?

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,900
He came from where we saw him in.

16
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,840
This is my most largest

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
garden I ever saw.

18
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,860
I'moit��.

19
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,720
Keep it up.

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,220
How does prices work?

21
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,500
All gas market

22
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,380
is in this house.

23
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,260
The biggest electricity

24
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
kapiste system

25
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,780
is purchased from

26
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,300
most of the ordinary provin Oklahoeia.

27
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,820
What vegetable summarizes

28
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,620
the energy output of

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,940
the market mechanism

30
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,940
I'm not mad.

31
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
The bedding is very friendly.

32
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Yifan,

33
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,940
I can't sleep in this light.

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Thank you.

36
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
Why do you suddenly have no interest in Yi He?

37
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Next time, I'll take you out.

38
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,940
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
The plane.

40
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
Look.

41
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,940
The sky is drawn out of a trace.

42
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,940
It's hard to feel the air.

43
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,940
I think you're turning the Wen Ke.

44
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,940
Something...

45
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,940
has happened.

46
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,940
What are you laughing at?

47
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,940
I'm sorry, what's wrong?

49
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,940
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
What's wrong?

51
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
I don't know.

52
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
You said your friend was hugged by a man

53
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,940
and slept for a night.

54
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Then that man said he was ashamed.

55
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Your friend is ugly.

56
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,940
That's not a big deal.

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
And that man

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
tried to wake up in the morning

59
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
and appeared before your friend.

60
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,940
I think it's possible that he did it on purpose.

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,940
I'm serious about asking you a question.

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,940
I'm so annoyed.

63
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,940
Yifan, you're here.

64
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,940
What are you talking about?

65
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Nothing.

66
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
You're here just in time.

67
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
I have a question for you.

68
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
It's okay.

69
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,940
Why are you so shy?

70
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
It's not you.

71
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
If there's a woman next to you,

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm annoyed.

73
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Are you looking at someone?

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
I'm looking at someone.

75
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm back.

76
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Come on, sister.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
I'm back.

78
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Thank you.

79
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
What can we do?

80
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm so annoyed.

81
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
I'm so annoyed.

82
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Yifan's friend was hugged by a man

83
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,940
for a night.

84
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
What night?

85
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
You didn't do it on purpose?

86
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
Yes.

87
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,940
You hugged him?

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
I'm so annoyed.

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,940
I'm so annoyed.

90
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Then you said it's a problem.

91
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
Maybe.

92
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
I'm so annoyed.

93
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,940
I'm so annoyed.

94
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
I'm so annoyed.

95
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm so annoyed.

96
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
You said he would

97
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
recognize his girlfriend.

98
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,940
Or his ex-girlfriend.

99
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,940
I've done this before.

100
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,940
I think he wants to seduce someone.

101
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
But his hands are too low-class.

102
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
He's too old-fashioned.

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
I don't even use them.

104
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,940
But I'll climb on his bed first.

105
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
That's right.

106
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
There's a big man.

107
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
He won't be scared to death.

108
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Or he has a girlfriend.

109
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
He's used to lying next to her.

110
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Or he's too mean.

111
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
He just wants to stand up.

112
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Or he just wants to be a little bit of a man.

113
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,940
That means he doesn't like her.

114
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Maybe he still hates her.

115
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,940
Yes.

116
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,940
But he's handsome and humorous.

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Yes.

118
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,940
It's been a long time since I hugged you.

119
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
You're not that...

120
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,940
so...

121
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
kind of...

122
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Even if I can't control my dream,

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
but with Sang Yan's personality,

124
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
if I really think about it,

125
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
I won't be able to bear it.

126
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,940
I think I've already moved on.

127
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
But is it possible?

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Have you seen the play of the negative grudge?

129
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
It's all the same.

130
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
Pretending to be close to you.

131
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
I'm nice to you.

132
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Then when you're in a state of self-pity,

133
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I'll be able to pull you away.

134
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,940
I'll fulfill his negative grudge.

135
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
Is it really because I've hurt him before?

136
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
Now you're using this method to revenge me?

137
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Is there a need to see the negative grudge?

138
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Is there?

139
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Yes.

140
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
Do you want to go to your room?

141
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
No, thanks.

142
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
No need to say thank you.

143
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Really?

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Yes.

145
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
No.

146
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
In my heart,

147
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
he's not that kind of person.

148
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Here.

149
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Why are you here?

150
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,940
What's going on?

151
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,940
I've been with him.

152
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,940
He should be willing to do anything.

153
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
If there's no place to dance,

154
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,940
I'll just dance here.

155
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
He's such a shining person.

156
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,940
If he wants something,

157
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
he should give it to him.

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Even if he wants to be the star in the sky,

159
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
he should give it to him.

160
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,940
I didn't expect that I'd be the little one

161
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
because of this.

162
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Sang Yan.

163
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Can I ask you to stop punishing me?

164
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Wei Yifan.

165
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm not that stupid, right?

166
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
I hate it.

167
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Every time I come out to see you,

168
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,940
I'm also annoyed that you've been here all the time.

169
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
I'll go to a place

170
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,940
far away from Beiyu in the south.

171
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
I'll go to Yi He in the future.

172
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
I hope you won't come to me like this.

173
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Sang Yan, you're very good.

174
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,940
I hurt you.

175
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
He'll always be like this.

176
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Let's be together.

177
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Just pretend that I'm not in a relationship with him.

178
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Say what?

179
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Sang Yan.

180
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Are you asleep?

181
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
No.

182
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,940
You don't need to open the door. I just have a few words to tell you.

183
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,140
I've thought about it.

184
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,540
In this situation, I'm not suitable to be with anyone else.

185
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540
So...

186
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,140
I'll move out as soon as possible.

187
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,140
I'll find a lawyer to live alone.

188
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,140
This won't affect you.

189
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm just here to make my decision.

190
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,140
Then you should rest early. Remember to close the door.

191
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,340
I'll find a lawyer soon.

192
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,340
I'm currently back.

193
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Mrs. thoughtful.

194
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,940
It's wonderful to be back.

195
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,740
Please confess to me.

196
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,340
Please confess to me.

197
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,340
Please.

198
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
I think Sang Yan should move in this way.

199
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,340
He's been working for months.

200
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,340
I can't let him move in.

201
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,340
Why?

202
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,340
Because I don't want to cause his problems.

203
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
You're a dream girl.

204
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,340
We're talking about the future.

205
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340
You're the one who lives there.

206
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
Why do you move in?

207
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Are you satisfied with the house?

208
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Not bad.

209
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
No, no, no.

210
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
No, no.

211
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Your kitchen and bedroom are connected.

212
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
The smell of oil and smoke is coming in.

213
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
How can I sleep?

214
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
And your wall is full of cracks.

215
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
You can't even brush your teeth.

216
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
It's good to find someone to brush it later.

217
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
I'm very sincere.

218
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
The rent is cheap.

219
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,340
If you like it, pay a deposit first.

220
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
This house is very expensive.

221
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,340
You'll be lured by others.

222
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Look at your house.

223
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
And the other side is still building a palace.

224
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,340
The sound will make my spirit fall.

225
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,340
You can't live in the house as you want.

226
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
It's cheaper than you.

227
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,340
Don't make me feel uncomfortable.

228
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,340
There's no house that's cheaper than this one.

229
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
I don't believe you can answer the question.

230
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,340
I'll look elsewhere if I can't live in this house.

231
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,340
No, no.

232
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
I'll take out my biggest sincerity.

233
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,340
I'll pay you the middle-end fee.

234
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,340
I'll make a big discount.

235
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
What do you think?

236
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Okay.

237
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
No.

238
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,340
We've received your sincerity.

239
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,340
But we'll think about it.

240
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
We'll look elsewhere.

241
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
No, no.

242
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Thank you.

243
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
Please.

244
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
Let's take a look.

245
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,340
Let's take a look.

246
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,340
The price of this room is really high.

247
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Let's discuss it.

248
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Let's take a look.

249
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,340
Are you going to report it to Sang Yan?

250
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Report what?

251
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Aren't you going to report it to the other party

252
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
when you're with your friends?

253
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
It's okay.

254
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
You'd better be sure.

255
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
What if he comes back suddenly?

256
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Will he...

257
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,340
He's going to leave today.

258
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
He won't go home.

259
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,340
I'll lose.

260
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,340
Why do you have so many beautiful little lights?

261
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,340
You even have this strip?

262
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Sang Yan made it.

263
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
He's afraid that you'll get hurt

264
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,340
when you're dreaming.

265
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,340
He treats you well.

266
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
It's useless.

267
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
People who dream

268
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
don't even think about these lights.

269
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
It's impossible for you two.

270
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
It's impossible for you two.

271
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Forget it.

272
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
You must have your own reason.

273
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,340
But it's better

274
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
if you move out like this.

275
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,340
At least it's better for him.

276
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
But it's true.

277
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,340
If you do this,

278
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
the guilt will become more and more obvious.

279
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,340
And you have to meet each other every day.

280
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Forgetting things in the past

281
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,340
is not about forgetting.

282
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Maybe moving out is better.

283
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,340
That way, you don't have to worry about the past.

284
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,340
Go to shower.

285
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
Okay, I'll go to shower.

286
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Hello, Sikang.

287
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
Let's see why the house is so tired.

288
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Hello.

289
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,340
Miss Wen.

290
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,340
I'm Zhong Jie Cao.

291
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,340
Can I call you?

292
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Yes.

293
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,340
I didn't know how you thought about

294
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
this house today.

295
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,340
Let's discuss it again.

296
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,340
You can tell me clearly.

297
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
What's the reason?

298
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,340
I'll send you

299
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
some other services.

300
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
I don't know what's the reason either.

301
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Okay, think about it.

302
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
But if you're sure about this house,

303
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,340
you must give me a proper order

304
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
before tomorrow night.

305
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Otherwise, I'll leave

306
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
another one.

307
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
Okay, I got it.

308
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Okay.

309
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
What are you looking at?

310
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
Why did you take a piece of it?

311
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
You think you can keep it

312
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
when you leave the house?

313
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
I haven't thought about

314
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,340
what I can hang up.

315
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,340
I see.

316
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,340
I'll send you

317
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,340
some nice paintings next time.

318
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
I'll send them to you.

319
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,340
I was thinking

320
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,340
when I was taking a bath.

321
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,340
Do you have to move?

322
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Even if you don't have

323
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,340
a date or a wife,

324
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,340
she doesn't mind you.

325
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,340
I think she should be very jealous.

326
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,340
She might be a little girl.

327
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,340
I just think

328
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,340
she's always making me feel

329
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
that she needs to be more jealous.

330
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
Just like this mark,

331
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,340
it must be hard

332
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
to hang up.

333
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
She must still be

334
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
in the past.

335
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
The mark on the heart

336
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,340
must be a mark.

337
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Why do you think

338
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
it's me?

339
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
So,

340
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
I killed Hongye

341
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
with Zhongjie today.

342
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
I'm just afraid you'll regret it.

343
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Please delay.

344
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Thank you.

345
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
The room is so big.

346
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
I won't move it.

347
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
The project is about to start.

348
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
I still have two

349
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
brothers and two sisters.

350
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,340
I'm just staying here.

351
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Have you ever

352
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
thought about moving?

353
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Of course I have.

354
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
But as long as I think of my mom,

355
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
I'll smile.

356
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
Why?

357
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
She gets up

358
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
at 5.30 a.m. every morning.

359
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
She prepares breakfast

360
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
for her family.

361
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
After she's done with her family,

362
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
she goes to the stock market

363
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
to take a rest.

364
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,340
It's already late at night.

365
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,340
She's always

366
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
supporting others.

367
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,340
If I really move,

368
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
then it's too much

369
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,340
to do it alone.

370
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
You're not moving out.

371
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I'm sure you're touched.

372
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
She doesn't know

373
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,340
that she thinks I'm living

374
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,340
in the house

375
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,340
for Shengfeng.

376
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,340
I think you and mom

377
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
are the same.

378
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
You're not in the right place.

379
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
You're not in the right place.

380
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
You're not in the right place.

381
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Then who's not?

382
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
People are busy

383
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
with their lives.

384
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm doing this

385
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
for others.

386
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
I'm doing this for others.

387
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
I'm happy to see others.

388
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
Why do people in this world

389
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
always want to be popular?

390
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,340
Please be nice to yourself.

391
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,340
Shouldn't you

392
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
love yourself first?

393
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Shouldn't you

394
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,340
love yourself first?

395
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Shouldn't you

396
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
love yourself first?

397
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Grandma...

398
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
Dianjian.

399
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
Episode 1

400
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Most people have it since they were kids.

401
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
It's good that they grow up.

402
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,340
But some people are more mature.

403
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,340
But the data is not enough.

404
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:25,340
How's your sleep time lately?

405
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I might have a short sleep when I'm busy with work.

406
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Come on.

407
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:36,340
You should make sure you have a stable and stable working time.

408
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,340
When you're not enough sleep or when you're under too much stress,

409
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,340
you might have a higher frequency of sleep.

410
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,340
It's mainly because of the pressure you're putting on.

411
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
Do you have a lot of pressure lately?

412
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
No.

413
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,340
I do.

414
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
How come?

415
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
I've been having it for three years.

416
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Then what about pressure?

417
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
I don't know.

418
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Are you living alone?

419
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
I have a roommate now.

420
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
I have a roommate.

421
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
If you make a dangerous move,

422
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
I'll look at you with my own eyes.

423
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Remember to keep your eyes on the door.

424
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
Don't make yourself too tired.

425
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,340
You're a commoner after living with Sang Yan, right?

426
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
I think so.

427
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,340
But I don't have a high frequency.

428
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,340
I'm only 5 or 6 times higher.

429
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
So you care about Sang Yan a lot.

430
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
She doesn't have any pressure.

431
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Is it because of the pressure you're putting on?

432
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
No.

433
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,340
It's not because of Sang Yan or her work.

434
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,340
You've been living with her for only two years.

435
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
What else?

436
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,340
None of you want to see her.

437
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
If you're willing to see her,

438
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
I'm your mother.

439
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Can you not feel my mother's love?

440
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
I know.

441
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,340
If you can't find the reason,

442
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,340
you can find a way to put pressure on her.

443
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
How?

444
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Love.

445
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Since you don't want to develop with Sang Yan,

446
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,340
you need to find a new man.

447
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,340
I don't know.

448
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
You don't know how to ask?

449
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,340
What's the point of your eyes?

450
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
You're just a piece of cake.

451
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
You're just a piece of cake.

452
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,340
You're just a piece of cake.

453
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
You don't want to see her.

454
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Say something.

455
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
You don't want to see her.

456
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,340
You don't want to see her.

457
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
How about a little bit of love?

458
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
You want to see her.

459
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,340
You want to express your feelings to her.

460
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
You can't be too transparent.

461
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Give me an example.

462
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,340
Just have a chat.

463
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,140
I think they are kind.

464
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,340
Is it too obvious?

465
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,940
No way.

466
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,140
I don't know how to do it.

467
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,140
I haven't talked to anyone.

468
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,540
What's wrong?

469
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,940
I saw Grandpa Su Huan.

470
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,140
I'll call him.

471
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,540
Okay.

472
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,940
I'll go back to the power station.

473
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,540
Okay. Bye.

474
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Ask Grandpa for help.

475
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,140
Okay.

476
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
Grandpa.

477
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,540
Grandpa, why are you here?

478
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,140
Hello.

479
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,740
Grandpa.

480
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Are you here to see a doctor?

481
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Which one?

482
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Yes.

483
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,540
Which one?

484
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,540
Grandpa, if you haven't finished watching,

485
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
why don't I watch the movie with you?

486
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
Okay.

487
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,540
Which one?

488
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,140
Where's Uncle Ma?

489
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,140
Where's Uncle Ma?

490
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
Where's Uncle Ma?

491
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Where's Uncle Ma?

492
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,540
Yes.

493
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,340
Where's the boss?

494
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
Where's the boss?

495
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,340
Where's the boss?

496
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,340
Where's the boss?

497
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,540
Where's the boss?

498
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,940
Boss, where are you going?

499
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,940
Where's the boss?

500
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
I want to ask you.

501
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,740
Where are you going?

502
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,340
I parked a car.

503
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,940
I went to the door to find you.

504
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,140
It's not a person.

505
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,540
The hospital is too big.

506
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,940
Grandpa will not find me.

507
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,940
It's okay.

508
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,140
I'll go with you.

509
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,340
No, thanks.

510
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,140
It's okay.

511
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,140
Don't be polite.

512
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,540
Goodbye, Miss Tiao.

513
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
Dr. Liu.

514
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
Sit down.

515
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,940
Dr. Liu, sorry.

516
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,140
I'm really sorry.

517
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,940
I just found out that

518
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,540
he just lost his memory.

519
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,140
But I'd like to ask your family to come with you.

520
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,740
I have to talk to them.

521
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,340
Boss, he's my family.

522
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,940
I mean your wife and grandson.

523
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,540
Last time, you said that they were still at home.

524
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
They know that you're in the hospital now.

525
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,740
Hello, Su Wanwan.

526
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,540
Do you know how noisy it is?

527
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,340
I just met Grandpa in the hospital.

528
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
I know.

529
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,140
Mom said that to me.

530
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,740
Do you know Grandpa's health condition?

531
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,940
Of course.

532
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,540
Didn't Tang Tiao have a memory?

533
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,140
He looks like a psycho.

534
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
Grandpa, you're back.

535
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,540
Grandpa.

536
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Grandpa.

537
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,140
Grandpa.

538
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Grandpa.

539
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,940
Mr. Su's resignation was faster.

540
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,940
He's in the period of childhood.

541
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
Then...

542
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,140
can this disease be cured?

543
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,140
It's impossible to completely reverse the disease.

544
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,340
As long as the treatment and the liver treatment

545
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,940
are in a hurry, the effect will be reversed.

546
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,140
You should think about

547
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,340
how to cooperate with the elderly to treat the disease.

548
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,140
How to take care of the elderly's future life.

549
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,540
The second child is in the sea.

550
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,340
The adjustment is not only for the patient, but also for the family.

551
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,940
I've been respected a long time ago.

552
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,340
What am I doing?

553
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,140
Don't blame yourself.

554
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,940
Didn't the doctor say that

555
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,540
the previous period was just a minor condition.

556
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,940
We were young and we forgot about it all day.

557
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,540
So it's hard to notice.

558
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,140
And everyone's condition is different.

559
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,540
I've seen Grandpa so many times.

560
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,940
I don't dare to believe that he has a second child.

561
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,540
What should I do?

562
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,540
What are you preparing for? I have no idea.

563
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Don't worry.

564
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,940
I have a grandmother who treats me as her grandson.

565
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,740
And she's my old client.

566
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,340
She took care of her second son,

567
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,340
the wife of the sea doctor for more than ten years.

568
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,340
Let's go ask her about it.

569
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
Thank you.

570
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,140
I'll go tell Grandpa now.

571
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
I know everything.

572
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,740
Look at the situation.

573
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,940
Grandpa.

574
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Grandpa.

575
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Grandpa.

576
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
Grandpa.

577
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,540
Who's sleeping?

578
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,940
Uncle.

579
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,540
Where's the music?

580
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
Mo Tou.

581
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
He died suddenly in the morning.

582
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,140
Don't disturb Grandpa.

583
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Mo Tou is my uncle.

584
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,540
He's been with him for 16 years.

585
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,740
Except for grandma,

586
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,140
Mo Tou should be Grandpa's old friend.

587
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,540
I'm not sure.

588
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,740
I'm not sure.

589
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
I'm not sure.

590
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm not sure.

591
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm not sure.

592
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
I'm not sure.

593
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
I'm not sure.

594
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
I'm not sure.

595
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm not sure.

596
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,340
I'm not sure.

597
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,340
I'm not sure.

598
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,340
I'm not sure.

599
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,340
I'm not sure.

600
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm not sure.

601
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm not sure.

602
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm not sure.

603
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
I'm not sure.

604
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
I'm not sure.

605
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm not sure.

606
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
I'm not sure.

607
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,340
I'm not sure.

608
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,340
I'm not sure.

609
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I'm not sure.

610
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm not sure.

611
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
I'm not sure.

612
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,340
I'm not sure.

613
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm not sure.

614
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm not sure.

615
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
I'm not sure.

616
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,340
I'm not sure.

617
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,340
I'm not sure.

618
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
I'm not sure.

619
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,140
I'm not sure.

620
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
I'm not sure.

621
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
I'm not sure.

622
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
I'm not sure.

623
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,440
I'm not certain.

624
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I'm not certain.

625
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,120
You can switch these cameras and save the audience.

626
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,620
I'll let you watch more and...

627
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,380
You should change who supports you.

628
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,640
Both of you expect an audience, right?

629
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,740
It is easy to change you all.

630
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,640
But in a greatSHOW House,

631
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
there are more people who don't.

632
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,240
Obviously there are these born kids cool and

633
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,140
have fun at the Playhouse as well.

634
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,540
When do you think this will be a hit spot?

635
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,840
be the name of their drama?

636
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,980
Master顆 deceived us with itself.

637
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,180
I think my boyfriend is...

638
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,780
Isn't he?

639
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,380
I like men.

640
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,580
I...

641
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,980
What about you and Sang Yan Tian?

642
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,900
We've been very busy recently.

643
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,340
We've been in the bathroom.

644
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,100
We've been working.

645
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,220
We've been moving.

646
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,060
I can't remember.

647
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,140
And I think I've said it many times.

648
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,060
He didn't even put it on his heart.

649
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,900
Why?

650
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,180
He seems to be very busy recently.

651
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,660
I heard from Su Hao that

652
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
Sang Yan Tian has been arranged by his family.

653
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,140
Sang Tian?

654
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,820
He's been there many times.

655
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
It's funny.

656
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,460
He's still in a relationship.

657
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,260
That's right.

658
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,780
I guess

659
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,900
it must be because you don't have a lover.

660
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,060
He's in a hurry to find a boyfriend.

661
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,900
I think he's a bit of a man.

662
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,740
What should I do?

663
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,980
Do you want to eat?

664
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,980
I thought you'd come back tomorrow

665
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,060
after you left the car.

666
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,260
It's easy to work.

667
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,140
I'll be back after work.

668
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,460
I ordered a takeaway.

669
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,020
I ordered too much.

670
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Do you want to eat with me?

671
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,420
I bought it myself.

672
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,820
I wanted to eat too much.

673
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,540
How can you say that?

674
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,140
Until I got sick.

675
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,180
I succeeded to gain my respect.

676
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,380
I'm fall historic.

677
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,140
Why are you suddenly out there?

678
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,980
Case closed?

679
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,180
It's okay. I'll just eat the pulse.

680
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,980
You're so stubborn.

681
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,860
I'll eat it in the future.

682
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,140
Ask him what's the star.

683
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,740
Then, according to his star,

684
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,460
tell him the advantages of the star.

685
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,380
I heard that

686
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,980
the male doctors in my sister

687
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
are very gentle and responsible.

688
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Are you a gentle person?

689
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
What did the doctor say?

690
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
The doctor said that

691
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
the role of the doctor is to be a playboy.

692
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Don't be too stressed.

693
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
If there is something wrong,

694
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
it's best to help them.

695
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
So, this means

696
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
I can't do it?

697
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
The doctor means

698
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,980
that when there is nothing wrong,

699
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,980
you have to be extra careful.

700
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
Do you have to do it?

701
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
If I don't make trouble for you,

702
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,980
do you want to do it yourself?

703
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
To be honest,

704
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,980
I don't really want to do it.

705
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
The male doctors in my sister

706
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
are indeed very close.

707
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
You can find the information.

708
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
I have to go to the hospital.

709
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
Hello.

710
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
Hello, Miss.

711
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
I'm Chengcao.

712
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,980
I have found a key to your condition.

713
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,980
You can check the data.

714
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
I'm sorry.

715
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
You don't have to call me.

716
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
I don't need to do the housework now.

717
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Is this the 10th Yan family?

718
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,980
Yes.

719
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Is my mother here?

720
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
Auntie, come in.

721
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
Auntie.

722
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Mom.

723
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,980
What brings you here?

724
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,980
I brought Kexin here.

725
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I brought her here.

726
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
I brought her here.

727
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
I brought her here.

728
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
I brought her here.

729
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
I brought her here.

730
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
I brought her here.

731
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
I brought her here.

732
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
You can sit down.

733
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
I'll get my clothes.

734
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
Auntie.

735
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Is this your first time here?

736
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Yes.

737
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
I'm going to visit her today.

738
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Auntie, can I...

739
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
It's okay.

740
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
It's okay.

741
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Do you like it?

742
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Let's take her out for dinner later.

743
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,980
Okay.

744
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Okay.

745
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
Thank you.

746
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Hello, auntie.

747
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Thank you.

748
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
You can talk to her.

749
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Okay.

750
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Auntie, have some water.

751
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
You can drink it.

752
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
You can drink it.

753
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
Kexin, sit down.

754
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Okay.

755
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,980
What are you doing?

756
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm cooking.

757
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
Have we met before?

758
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,980
I think you're familiar with it.

759
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,980
I've met him before.

760
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
When he was in high school.

761
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
You're so heavy now.

762
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
He'll definitely be distracted by you.

763
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,980
You really like him?

764
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,980
I like him, but I'm too lazy to say it.

765
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,980
You're the little girl

766
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
who was in love with A Yan?

767
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,980
We really didn't have a date at that time.

768
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,980
Listen, A Yan has been a little girl.

769
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
You've been so considerate of us.

770
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,980
When you were in elementary school,

771
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,980
you were just a little girl.

772
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
We gave up on him.

773
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
But we didn't know

774
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,980
what kind of life-threatening learning he had.

775
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
I didn't know

776
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980
you were his new friend.

777
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
Are you free tomorrow?

778
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
Can we watch a movie together?

779
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,980
A Yan has been in college for years.

780
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
He didn't have a partner.

781
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
He wanted to scare us.

782
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
He thought he was being bullied.

783
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
We didn't let him have a bad influence.

784
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Why are you all bullying yourself?

785
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
Are you bullying your wife?

786
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
Dad.

787
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
You two can talk.

788
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
I'll go back to my room first.

789
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Okay.

790
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
That little girl is getting close.

791
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
Brother,

792
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
you're still a girl

793
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,980
with her.

794
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Did you tell your parents?

795
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,980
You disappeared for so long.

796
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Of course I can ask you clearly.

797
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
I went out for a while.

798
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Kexin.

799
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Yes.

800
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Sit down.

801
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I'll tell A Yan some words.

802
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Okay.

803
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Sit down.

804
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
What's wrong with you?

805
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Last time,

806
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
you were supposed to meet Miss Yu.

807
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
But you disappeared.

808
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
His mother found something wrong

809
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
and came to me.

810
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
I found out

811
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
you two were not in touch.

812
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Tell me.

813
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
You can't stand it.

814
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Do you have someone else in your heart?

815
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
It's a young girl

816
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
who was bullied by her parents.

817
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Is she your girlfriend?

818
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Is she your girlfriend?

819
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Why are you so excited?

820
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
I'm not.

821
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,980
I'm not.

822
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Do you like her?

823
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
You're so stupid.

824
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
Go after her if you like her.

825
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Where are you from?

826
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,980
I like that girl.

827
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Okay.

828
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
I'm the one who's in trouble.

829
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
I don't care about you.

830
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
I don't care about anyone else.

831
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
You're right.

832
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
It sounds like

833
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,980
you really care about her.

834
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
You're so stupid.

835
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Come on.

836
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Change your clothes.

837
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Have a try.

838
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
This thing is burnt.

839
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Why is it so careless?

840
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
You two stay together.

841
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
If you eat,

842
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
you'll be in trouble.

843
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
Hurry up.

844
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
He Xing,

845
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
let's go out for dinner later.

846
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,980
What do you want to eat?

847
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
You can eat whatever you like.

848
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
What do you like to eat?

849
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,980
I'll get you some.

850
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Okay.

851
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
I'll get you some.

852
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Okay.

853
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Have some.

854
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
I haven't.

855
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
Don't you want to eat?

856
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
You eat first.

857
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,980
I'll wash it.

858
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
I heated it up.

859
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
Let's eat together later.

860
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
It's hot.

861
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,980
You're going to take a bath first, right?

862
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Of course I'll eat while it's hot.

863
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
I don't know how she's doing.

864
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
I know you might not want to accept it.

865
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
But please believe me.

866
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
I'm sure you're the one who's the most suitable for her.

867
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
What's wrong?

868
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Are you hungry?

869
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Or do you want to ask me

870
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
if I can make a deal?

871
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
No.

872
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
I just want to say

873
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
that you've been

874
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,980
wearing too much in the public area recently.

875
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm wearing it normally.

876
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
I'm not good at it.

877
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
I'm afraid I can't do it.

878
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
I...

879
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I can't control it.

880
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
I know

881
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,980
that I can easily make people feel guilty.

882
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
But we're all adults.

883
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
I can't be a little determined.

884
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
She said that you must accept it.

885
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,980
You can't be too obvious and be a little bit shy.

886
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
I really can't.

887
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
I'm afraid I'll be the most...

888
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
Oh, no.

889
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,980
What did I say?

890
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,980
I'm really shy.

891
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
I mean

892
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
you can pay more attention to it.

893
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
Wait a minute.

894
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,980
Tell me.

895
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Tell me.

896
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,980
Are you afraid that you'll be guilty?

897
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
Well...

898
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
I just want to take your words.

899
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,980
You want to kiss me?

900
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,980
Kiss me?

901
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,980
Kiss me?

902
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,980
I want you to look at me.

903
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,980
I just want to look at me.

904
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
Kiss me?

905
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
Kiss me?

906
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Come here.

907
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,980
I didn't mean that.

908
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
Then don't be afraid.

909
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,980
I always like to use my eyes to replace

910
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
and think about it.

911
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
I'm afraid

912
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
that I'll be the most...

913
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,980
But why should I?

914
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,980
The distance will be far away.

915
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,980
I won't let you go.

916
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,980
Let me be here without you.

917
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
I want to kiss you.

918
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
Only you.

919
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
So you're a magician.

920
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,980
I have a lot of friends who are also magicians.

921
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Their personalities are very good.

922
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
This kind of reverse-interference

923
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
makes the model look very fast.

924
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
I still like the model.

925
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,980
And...

926
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,980
And the model also likes to teach friends.

927
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,980
But I'm just very bored.

928
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
There are so many people in the bathroom.

929
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,980
I'm leaving.

930
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Thank you.

931
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
What's going on?
