1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the top of the list, Nan Hong.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello, classmate.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a new student from the team.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome. Welcome.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Welcome to the hot place.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Welcome. Welcome.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're here.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let me explain.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We've been in this school for four years.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We can make a difference.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a great fate.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is it fate?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But you have fate.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm so miserable.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Chen Junwen.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I told you I don't know him.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If we weren't classmates,

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I would be angry right away.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I would be in trouble.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, you can change it.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not going to change it.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm angry.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm angry with you.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm angry with you.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm angry with you.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is Xiao Feifei.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Qian Fei.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm Chen Junwen.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're both professional.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello, classmate.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You two are...

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Duan Jansheng.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The computer.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Handsome.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He's from our class.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm here to talk to him.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
His name is...

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Sanya.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sanya.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sanya.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sanya.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I miss you so much.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why don't you come to the same place?

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I really want to sleep with you.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm in the club.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's so hot.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I said

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
we can't accept him.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's great.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's change the invitation.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Brother.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We can live with a quiet, cool and quiet house.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We don't want to live with a big, big house.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You don't know me enough.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
People who know me know that I'm a cool and quiet house.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're also a cool and quiet house.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You sleep in the kitchen.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll get caught.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm afraid of sleeping in the half-night sleep.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
His old house...

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't talk nonsense.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When will I get caught?

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
My dad and mom have lost.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's wrong with my dad?

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's wrong with my dad?

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's ugly.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not a big deal to beat the tiger and the duck.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The scariest thing is that

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you can't get up in the middle of the night.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You have to come to the next day.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Mm.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll tér

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It must be the place where you had a bad night's sleep

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and you sleep in the wrong bed.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,820
It was out of these two.

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,100
You only want to hit theips with your right hand.

78
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,860
Don't tell me it's impossible?

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,060
It's not easy to find out this information,

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
You're so write your thesis book in your pocket and send it to me quickly.

81
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,900
Do you think so, I will teach you pretty well.

82
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,640
Why so quick.

83
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,300
I just need to ask you,

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,520
Dear,

85
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,660
where's and you remember my friends,

86
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,260
they say I called past colors.

87
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:42,340
spoken witness

88
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,420
Come on

89
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,220
Why are you here

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,940
Who Ekie

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,700
would still be you,

92
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,220
if I am not going to love him.

93
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,660
Can't take it from you.

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:10,860
Have a girl named Wu Literally forget explosive words.

95
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,980
Can't take away from her the career.

96
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,820
Much stronger than any other animals

97
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,860
who are modern.

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,740
I knew a relative for a while.

99
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,860
Go to bed.

100
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,740
It doesn't look like me when I wake up.

101
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,860
Why?

102
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,260
If you were one of them,

103
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,220
you'd have印 on your hand.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,860
Look at our ourselves together,

105
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,940
because we can't...

106
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,740
Third Brother

107
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,460
I was happy.

108
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,260
I remember we miss each other.

109
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Well...

110
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,740
I don't want to be the one who didn't happen this morning.

111
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I have to go out now. I'm going to interview him.

112
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I'll tell you when I get back.

113
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
No.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,740
Tell me first.

115
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
What did you do this morning?

116
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
I dreamed.

117
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,740
I can't control my behavior.

118
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Didn't you say you wouldn't come to my room?

119
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
So I really don't know what's going on this time.

120
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
This is really my problem.

121
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,740
I'm sure I won't be there again.

122
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,740
To be honest,

123
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
I'm quite scared.

124
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,740
I don't know what you'll do.

125
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,740
If I wake up one day and find out my true colors,

126
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,740
I'll be taken away by you.

127
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,740
You don't have to be so...

128
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
So-so.

129
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
No.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
We just met.

131
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
I accidentally went to your room when I was in the bathroom.

132
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,740
And I accidentally found a place to sleep on your bed.

133
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
I never had any physical contact with you.

134
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
How did you know?

135
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
I woke up earlier than you.

136
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,740
It's you who's not sleeping well.

137
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,740
When I left, you still took me home.

138
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
You took me home?

139
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
And then?

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
You finished talking?

141
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Anyway,

142
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,740
you're the one who's not clear about my physical contact.

143
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,740
This time, you're the one who's under the spell.

144
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Under the spell?

145
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,740
What's under the spell?

146
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
The last time I hugged you.

147
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Isn't that the same under the spell?

148
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
I'm still in the past.

149
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Who has the best idea about who?

150
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Isn't that the same thing that's been going on for a long time?

151
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
I'm really going to be late.

152
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,740
I'll talk to you when I get back.

153
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

154
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

155
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

156
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

157
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

158
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,740
I'm going to the bathroom.

159
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Where's staircase?

160
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
The way down.

161
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
Throw it in.

162
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
Throw it in.

163
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Throw it in.

164
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
Go and get water.

165
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Ma Ma!

166
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,740
Ma Ma!

167
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
my lord.

168
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Come come.

169
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
Where's my medicine?

170
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
I have put in all your instruments inside.

171
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Not a single box.

172
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
No.

173
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,700
No

174
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,460
You leave food alone

175
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,300
Why are you here?

176
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,200
Why are you inside the trash bin?

177
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Where's your medicine?

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,080
Drey

179
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Chi asked

180
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,380
What are you talking about?

181
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,820
I forgot

182
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,500
Master

183
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,420
I'll take you to the hospital now

184
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,340
and get the medicine

185
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:33,940
Okay

186
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,220
I'll go to the car

187
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,860
Master

188
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,940
You just stand here and wait for me

189
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,740
I'm a good car, so I'll come back

190
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,020
Don't go around

191
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,140
You said

192
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,340
Where can I go?

193
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,700
Stop the car

194
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,980
Go

195
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,380
Grandma

196
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,380
The doctor said you can't eat those things

197
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,060
You should pay attention to it

198
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,540
Okay

199
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,620
Pay more attention to the news

200
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,140
What if you feel uncomfortable?

201
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,980
I'll accompany you to see the doctor next time

202
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,060
Okay

203
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,580
You two wait here

204
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,780
I'll take a look for you

205
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,580
Thank you

206
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,740
Miss Lin Lin

207
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:39,900
Uncle Ma

208
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,740
Did you see our old man?

209
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,540
Grandpa Su

210
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,220
Yes

211
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,260
I didn't see him

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Oh, no

213
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,420
Something's wrong

214
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,140
What's wrong?

215
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,300
I parked the car

216
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,860
and asked him to wait for me at the door

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
I went to the door

218
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,780
No one

219
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,740
I went to the door

220
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,380
Uncle Ma, don't be late

221
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,860
Hello

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,660
Can you ask if you can find someone here?

223
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,340
Do I need to help you?

224
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,340
I'll help you to find someone

225
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,940
Go to the front to ask

226
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,940
He looks weird

227
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,420
He's so crazy

228
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,660
He's looking for someone

229
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,980
Where's the car?

230
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,460
Then

231
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,140
Then he left the car

232
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,340
He left the car

233
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,900
Yes

234
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,580
Where did he go?

235
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,900
I don't know

236
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,420
Tell me

237
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,980
Did Grandpa die with him?

238
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,260
No

239
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,180
I didn't say that

240
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,700
I just said it's possible

241
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,180
What a coincidence

242
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,540
Aunt Fang said she was in a emergency

243
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,940
Grandpa just disappeared

244
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,900
I really need to go to the living room

245
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,500
I have a little bit of a plan

246
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,340
You can think of something

247
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,940
Don't be so rich

248
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,260
Thank you

249
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,540
Hello, Aunt Fang

250
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,500
Are you feeling better?

251
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,980
I bought some fruits to visit you

252
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,580
Someone is coming to visit me

253
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,140
Don't worry

254
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,820
Then I'll go to visit you

255
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,220
It's okay

256
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,340
Thank you

257
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,180
Goodbye

258
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,900
Bye

259
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,460
Bye

260
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,660
Is the address reliable?

261
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,860
Of course it's reliable

262
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,660
I have many friends in the house

263
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,500
It's not easy to get a address

264
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,740
I didn't expect you to be so good at it

265
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
That's it

266
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,860
That's it

267
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,260
Okay, I'll do it

268
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,260
Why is the door not closed?

269
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,660
No

270
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
What's wrong?

271
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,180
It's okay

272
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,980
Let's go

273
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,140
What if grandpa is inside?

274
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
We just come to visit grandpa

275
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,980
Let's go

276
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,580
Is there anything wrong?

277
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,420
Yes

278
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,100
What can I prepare?

279
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,660
A meeting

280
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,540
Okay

281
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,500
Wait

282
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,260
What's wrong again?

283
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,220
I can't pack it

284
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,380
Are you ready?

285
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,100
Yes

286
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,980
I just pack it like this

287
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,020
What are you doing?

288
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,580
What are you doing?

289
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,140
I'm scared

290
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,700
You're here

291
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,180
I'm scared

292
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,820
Don't come here

293
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
I'll call you later

294
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,860
Xiao'an

295
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,620
Grandpa, you're really here

296
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,820
You're sick

297
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,980
I'm here to see him

298
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,060
What's wrong with him?

299
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,060
He's just...

300
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,900
He doesn't listen to me

301
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,060
He doesn't want to take medicine

302
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,340
He needs to go to the hospital to get medicine

303
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,740
Later, my family...

304
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,620
knew you were sick

305
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I came to see him

306
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,940
That's what you meant

307
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
What do you mean?

308
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,820
I've been here for a long time

309
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,380
What do I do?

310
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,020
Fang, you need to put the medicine here

311
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,180
You need to take the medicine

312
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,420
Remember to eat it

313
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,180
Thank you

314
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm in trouble

315
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,020
No

316
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,860
Welcome

317
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,420
I wish you a long and healthy life

318
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,660
I'll put the fruit here

319
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,060
Can you ride a bike to take me to the wind?

320
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,660
Now I understand

321
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,380
why grandma is looking for her own life

322
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,100
The other half has no feelings

323
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,060
and no meaning to be together

324
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Qiaoqiao

325
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,660
I'm left alone now

326
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,660
Why didn't you tell your parents?

327
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,860
They're gone

328
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,820
and I have a lot of brothers

329
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,700
I've always been the most ungrateful one

330
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,300
Unlike my brother

331
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm a step back from him

332
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,020
I told my dad that I wanted to go to the bird court to see the opening ceremony

333
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,380
He said, OK

334
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,420
I'll go as long as I get to the first 15

335
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,620
I got 28

336
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,900
How many people do you have?

337
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
30

338
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
That's good

339
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,540
You're not the first

340
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,060
You won't know

341
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,460
I feel like I'm a thief

342
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,100
I've been thinking

343
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,020
if I get better

344
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,620
I can go to Beijing with Xinxin

345
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,820
My dad was angry when he saw my miracle

346
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,180
My mom and my brother were going to see the Olympics

347
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,940
They were going to the North and to the West

348
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,380
Then Tianyu and Lu Hua left the car

349
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,340
The natural power of a sokong

350
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,420
stands by thelan

351
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,940
but is dead

352
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,260
The former backbone is the biological power

353
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Older brother, Hu has come over

354
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,060
A singtong

355
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,740
Zhang Xiao'ai

356
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,100
Let my dad know

357
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,060
I don't think so.

358
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,780
That's right.

359
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,500
They must love each other.

360
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,060
We just lack communication.

361
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,020
So we have less opportunities to express love.

362
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,220
My name is Zhong Siqiao.

363
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,940
There may be a bridge in the name.

364
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,740
So I often come to the bridge.

365
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,220
Looking at the bridge,

366
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
I imagine how many

367
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,100
roadways it takes to reach the people.

368
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,220
I suddenly feel very hopeful.

369
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,180
Through a bridge,

370
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,660
you can reach another city.

371
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,540
You can also reach another dream.

372
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Isn't it the same between people?

373
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,540
In fact, you hide a bridge in your heart.

374
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,300
As long as you walk past it,

375
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,340
you will find

376
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,660
that many people love you.

377
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,140
No.

378
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,940
Of course.

379
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
The real love is not needed to buy a bag

380
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,580
or to get the first one.

381
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,220
If you really give it to someone,

382
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,580
you can return it.

383
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I will give it to you.

384
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,220
I will give it to you.

385
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,220
I will give it to you.

386
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,220
I will give it to you.

387
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,220
I will give it to you.

388
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
I will give it to you.

389
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
I will give it to you.

390
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,220
I will give it to you.

391
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
I will give it to you.

392
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
I will give it to you.

393
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I will give it to you.

394
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
I will give it to you.

395
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I will give it to you.

396
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
I will give it to you.

397
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,220
I will give it to you.

398
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
I will give it to you.

399
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
I will give it to you.

400
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I will give it to you.

401
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,220
I will give it to you.

402
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
I will give it to you.

403
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,220
I will give it to you.

404
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,220
I will give it to you.

405
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
I will give it to you.

406
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
I will give it to you.

407
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
It smells good.

408
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
It smells good.

409
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,220
It's delicious.

410
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Some people

411
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,220
don't want me to eat.

412
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
They are still thinking about it.

413
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,220
I am so fat again.

414
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,220
I will take your sleeping bag.

415
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,220
It's useless.

416
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
I forgot to use it

417
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
when I was a little girl.

418
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
What did you do this time?

419
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,220
Xiaojiao.

420
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Can I ask you a question?

421
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Go ahead.

422
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Before,

423
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,220
didn't you

424
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,220
go to bed with Su Hoan?

425
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,220
Did he

426
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
ask you to express his apology

427
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,220
or pay you a visit?

428
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Then you said

429
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
it seems that I

430
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,220
got into a big trouble.

431
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
I owe him.

432
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Then what are you going to do?

433
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
It's not a debt return.

434
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
How can you use it to pay back?

435
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Is it such a low-cost method?

436
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Then I am still guilty.

437
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Who has the idea

438
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
of who?

439
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
It's a matter of one-eyed people.

440
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
But he seems to feel guilty.

441
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
What? Who?

442
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
You are not who.

443
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I am a friend.

444
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
Then

445
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,220
after Su Hoan

446
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,220
did you find

447
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
any other way to get your work done?

448
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
I am a girl.

449
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,220
If he is so clever,

450
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
he will be too kind.

451
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
But I pretended to be his girlfriend

452
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,220
when I was young.

453
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
I ate with his grandpa.

454
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,220
I think I was a little bit arrogant.

455
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
You pretended to be his girlfriend?

456
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,220
I pretended to be his girlfriend.

457
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
I just did it for him.

458
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I will not

459
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
do anything else.

460
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Then when should I return it?

461
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,220
I will return it to you.

462
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
I will return it to you.

463
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Look, he is here again.

464
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Hello?

465
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
It's your dad.

466
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
What's wrong?

467
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
He has been lying to himself.

468
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
He is in a car accident.

469
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,220
He is in a hurry.

470
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
But he still doesn't know

471
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,220
where he is going.

472
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
He called Hao An.

473
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
But his phone is not on.

474
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Okay, I will go immediately.

475
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
What's wrong?

476
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
Something happened.

477
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
I will tell you when I make it clear.

478
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Be careful.

479
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Okay.

480
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,220
I will go immediately.

481
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Be careful.

482
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
Grandpa,

483
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
do you know where

484
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,220
the car accident happened?

485
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Where are you going?

486
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Grandma.

487
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
Grandma, where are you going?

488
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Are you going to travel again?

489
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
I am not going to travel.

490
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,220
Do you want to see this old man?

491
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
Xiao Du is not in a hurry.

492
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Lin Zhen Jun is not in a hurry.

493
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
Tao Tao is not in a hurry.

494
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,220
You should continue to see him.

495
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
I thought you were going to leave.

496
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
I am going to leave

497
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
after I finish talking with you.

498
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Grandma, he is not in a hurry.

499
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Grandpa,

500
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,220
where is Hao An?

501
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,220
Hello?

502
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
Grandpa said you were in a car accident.

503
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
Where are you hurt?

504
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
What? I am in the company.

505
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
He is going to the hospital.

506
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Grandpa,

507
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,220
Hao An said he was in the company for a meeting.

508
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,220
No, Xiao An.

509
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
It was Xiao An's parents.

510
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
They were in a car accident.

511
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,220
They are in the hospital now.

512
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
Grandpa,

513
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
why don't you tell Hao An?

514
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
Grandma,

515
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
who is it?

516
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Who is it?

517
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Hurry up.

518
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,220
Grandpa is talking nonsense.

519
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Grandpa is talking nonsense with you.

520
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
What are you doing?

521
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I will talk to you later.

522
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,220
Okay.

523
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
I am sorry.

524
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
I am sorry.

525
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
I am sorry.

526
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,220
Sorry.

527
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I am so nervous.

528
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
When I went out with Mu Tou,

529
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
I was so nervous.

530
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Good boy.

531
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Good boy.

532
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
It had been a long time.

533
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
I forgot

534
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,220
to take care of them

535
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
when I was a child.

536
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
You touched them,

537
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
hard,

538
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,220
but

539
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
they no tears.

540
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,220
But

541
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
in the end,

542
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,660
Save her!

543
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,140
It's all my fault.

544
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,860
It's a pity that

545
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,300
Xiao'an is still young.

546
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,220
She's not as young as her parents.

547
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,820
Xiao'an, don't be afraid.

548
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,580
I'll take care of you.

549
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,420
Be good.

550
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Yan Yi.

551
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Yan Yi, what are you doing?

552
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,620
I've grown up.

553
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Yan Yi.

554
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
Yan Yi.

555
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
Yan Yi.

556
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Yan Yi.

557
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,820
Don't mind me. I'm fine.

558
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,020
Who's minding you?

559
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,140
I'm talking about her.

560
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,020
She's been in a coma for a long time.

561
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,020
She's very old.

562
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,220
She's been sleeping recently.

563
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
How old is she?

564
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
I don't know.

565
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,820
She's getting old anyway.

566
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,220
Grandpa is the same.

567
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,420
When people get old,

568
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,420
they'll be unable to speak.

569
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
They'll always be like children.

570
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,420
My dad is not old.

571
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
He's very stubborn now.

572
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,620
He can't speak.

573
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,820
Wutou, she's talking about you.

574
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,420
Find her.

575
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,420
You're really blaming grandpa and grandma.

576
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,760
Plama,

577
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,580
get up.

578
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,620
In tralking,

579
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,820
it was my parents'sguitar string threat.

580
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:13,940
That day when my dad

581
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,820
broke up with my brother,

582
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,420
he refused to give me a lift.

583
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,220
It was the hardest time in my life.

584
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,140
I saw him living alone at the door.

585
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,300
He was like a dead wood.

586
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,020
I walked to where he was.

587
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,100
I was so moved.

588
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,100
I was thinking

589
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,540
I was in a similar situation with him.

590
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Without his parents,

591
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,660
without his family,

592
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,860
I told him to come back.

593
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,820
Then why didn't you let him live with you?

594
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,100
I saw him.

595
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,460
I just remembered the feeling of the moment.

596
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,380
You...

597
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,020
You're back so late.

598
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,220
I have a lot of orders today.

599
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,580
Let's have a night snack together later.

600
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm not hungry.

601
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,060
I'm hungry.

602
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,220
Are you all right?

603
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,220
Are you sick?

604
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,100
Yes.

605
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,140
Are you still sick?

606
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,620
I'm a little girl.

607
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,980
You still worry I would take care of you?

608
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,860
Beginner will take care of you.

609
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,580
Hello?

610
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,180
Baby girl.

611
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,500
Ling'er.

612
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,660
How old are you?

613
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,020
But I haven't hugged my dad for a long time.

614
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
You can't hug me?

615
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,140
Okay.

616
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,020
No.

617
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,820
Are you bullied by others?

618
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,740
Who bullied you?

619
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,580
Tell me.

620
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,060
You...

621
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,660
Really?

622
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,260
I hugged you and you were so mad.

623
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,860
Then I'm relieved.

624
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,300
Then you go home first.

625
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,740
Let your mom cook me some noodles.

626
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,940
I'll be back soon.

627
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,460
Okay.

628
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,060
Then you go home early.

629
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,700
Bye.

630
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,260
Take care.

631
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,260
You're back.

632
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,580
Dad said he was hungry and wanted to eat noodles.

633
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,580
I'm ready to sleep.

634
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,220
You cook noodles for your dad.

635
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,260
What's wrong?

636
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,980
Your face is so bad.

637
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,180
Are you sick?

638
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm fine.

639
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,420
I should just take a cold.

640
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,780
Don't say that.

641
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,100
Go to bed for a few days.

642
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,180
A girl's family

643
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,900
knows her job and is busy all day.

644
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,500
She doesn't know how to love herself.

645
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,340
How can she find a partner?

646
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,740
Mom, don't look at me.

647
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,100
Okay.

648
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,900
I'll cook noodles for your dad later.

649
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,900
Drink this medicine.

650
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,060
Go to bed early.

651
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,220
Okay.

652
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,620
Don't be so mean.

653
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,060
Sister, you can't be sick.

654
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,820
I can't write a few words.

655
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,860
Mom won't let me sleep.

656
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,540
Please help me.

657
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,140
Guoqiang, don't disturb your sister.

658
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,820
She's not feeling well.

659
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,900
Write a word.

660
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,780
Mom, it's okay.

661
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,740
I can't write a few words.

662
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,740
Come and have a look.

663
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,140
She's gone.

664
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,580
She's gone.

665
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,460
Why are you selling some again?

666
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,980
You asked her what she wanted?

667
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,860
Thing you wanted?

668
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,100
No.

669
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,460
Why are you so surprised?

670
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
A simple answer.

671
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
Be honest.

672
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm not scared.

673
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,220
I don't know what you will do.

674
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,220
If I wake up one day and find out my true self,

675
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,220
I will be taken away by you.

676
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
I have something to do today.

677
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
I won't go back so early.

678
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I will talk about it some other day.

679
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I have something for you.

680
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
Gu Chengyun.

681
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
What is it?

682
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
You want me to pick you up for a gift.

683
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Can I have that now?

684
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
Pardon?

685
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
See you off at work.

686
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
Sure.

687
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Thanks, Yifan.

688
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
I'm not a fan of you.

689
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,220
You need to be a little bit more patient.

690
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Okay, I got it.

691
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
I'll go back early.

692
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,220
You're still in charge of the school.

693
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Aren't you just friends?

694
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
We have a contract.

695
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Speaking of that,

696
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
we're going to buy a gift for this school president.

697
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
He's a classmate of the same class with Sang Yan.

698
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
We just got married.

699
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,220
We even have children.

700
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Yifan,

701
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
how did you know Sang Yan?

702
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,220
I remember your mother's school is like a university in the United States.

703
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
High school classmate?

704
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
High school classmate?

705
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Didn't you go out for something?

706
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,220
No.

707
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,220
I heard that when Sang Yan was in high school,

708
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,220
there was a girl who seemed to like him very much.

709
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,220
She hasn't been chasing him for a long time.

710
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,220
She's been missing him until she graduated from college.

711
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
I don't know.

712
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,220
I'm curious.

713
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
What kind of person

714
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
can make Sang Yan such a great person

715
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,220
and like him for so long?

716
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Someone from the graduation ceremony said

717
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,220
that the best thing is not to be able to get it.

718
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,220
That's why I'm so sad.

719
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,220
You remember what he said when he graduated from college?

720
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,220
Yes, I remember.

721
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
He said

722
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,220
that I was able to be such a good person.

723
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Why did he say that?

724
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
Is that possible?

725
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,220
He's so proud.

726
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,220
I can't let myself down in front of others.

727
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
You seem to know him well.

728
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
I think he's drunk

729
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
and just joking.

730
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
Can't he just be drunk

731
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
and keep on joking

732
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,220
and tell the truth?

733
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,220
Thank you, Miss Li Fan.

734
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,220
Why don't you go around?

735
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Or do you have anything you want to eat?

736
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
I'll treat you.

737
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,220
No, thanks.

738
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,220
I remember.

739
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,220
The senior senior said that

740
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,220
he said that if he met the person again,

741
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
he would still treat him well.

742
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,220
But his mentality is definitely different.

743
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,220
So, who is the best for Sang Yan now?

744
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Be careful.

745
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,220
Maybe he has another purpose.

746
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220
For example, for you.

747
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
Me? Yes.

748
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Have you ever seen a negative sentence?

749
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,220
It's all like this.

750
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Pretending to be close to you first,

751
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
and treat you well.

752
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Then when you're in a state of emergency

753
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,220
and can't take it anymore,

754
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
you'll be able to throw you away.

755
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
And you'll be able to finish his revenge.

756
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Didn't you say

757
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,220
he only said one thing that night?

758
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Did I say that?

759
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
I have no idea.

760
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Maybe I was wrong.

761
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
We're in this industry.

762
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
It's okay to joke and gossip.

763
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
But being a news reporter

764
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,220
can't be this attitude.

765
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,220
Thank you for telling me this.

766
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
But if we talk about love,

767
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
I don't know how to be more serious.

768
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
I know a lot about love.

769
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
But I think

770
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,220
what you want to see is not a matter of experience.

771
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,220
Just like a first love,

772
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
it's simple and beautiful.

773
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,220
You just want to be happy with each other.

774
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
You just don't want to go back.

775
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,220
I've bought the things.

776
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm going home.

777
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Okay.

778
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Bye, Yifan.

779
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Go out.

780
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Go out.

781
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
You haven't said what is going on?

782
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Didn't we say

783
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
we can't 짤 over Friday in the PR department?

784
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Fine, let me...

785
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,720
Come in.

786
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,220
Come in.

787
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,720
Come in.

788
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,220
Come in.

789
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Come in.

790
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,720
Come in.

791
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,220
Come in.

792
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Come in.

793
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,720
Come in.

794
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I've already admitted it.

795
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,220
What do you mean?

796
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,220
The moon is still in the moon.

797
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,220
I'm wearing clothes.

798
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,220
What's the reason?

799
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,220
Have you drunk?

800
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
It's useless to use the chair to push the door.

801
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
You might have to lock the door if you have to.

802
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
I'll go to the hospital as soon as possible.

803
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,220
You...

804
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Are you getting red?

805
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,220
I'm just a little bit.

806
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Why are you getting red?

807
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,220
It's too hot.

808
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,220
It's very hot recently. Didn't you notice?

809
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,220
I... I just didn't see the guy's body.

810
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,220
And I told you before we were in a group that we had already made a deal.

811
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,220
I said, you can't wear...

812
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
You can't wear a hat. And you agreed.

813
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
You still said I was pretty.

814
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I did say that.

815
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
But I'm in a good mood today.

816
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
I'll give you some sweet food.

817
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,220
I'll try to avoid this situation.

818
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
You should be more careful.

819
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Every time we deal with it, we say the same thing.

820
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
And the final result is...

821
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,220
After four months, Auntie Lu will call.

822
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,220
You can say your request. I'll cooperate with you.

823
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
I'll go alone.

824
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,220
But you really...

825
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,220
You really solved the problem.

826
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
I'm sorry.

827
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Can you keep your distance from other men?

828
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
Can you walk away?

829
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,220
Don't keep your distance from Xiao Zai.

830
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
Keep your distance from me.

831
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Let me be the one who can be your little...

832
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Little pitiful.

833
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,220
Then I...

834
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
I'm sorry to pity you.

835
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,220
I...

836
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,220
Thank you.

837
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,220
The starlight in the street looks at me.

838
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,220
It's not me.

839
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,220
I know it's not me.

840
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
You pity me.

841
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,220
It's just a pity that I can't bear to see you.

842
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Wait a minute.

843
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,220
I was so upset when Mo Changyun touched me.

844
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,220
I didn't mind that Sang Yan touched me.

845
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,220
Can you keep your distance from other men?

846
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
What's wrong with him?

847
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
He seems to be...

848
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Except for you.

849
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Why do you keep your distance from me?

850
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
I'm sorry to pity you.

851
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Can you keep your distance from me?

852
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,220
It seems that it's only him.

853
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Yes, it's only him.

854
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,880
I think it's his choice now.

855
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,460
Should I still like him?

856
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,220
I can't dream anymore today.

857
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,220
I can't sleep well.

858
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,220
Why are there so many lights in these things?

859
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Why are there so many lights?

860
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Why are there so many protection?

861
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Why are there so many lights in these things?

862
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Are these all for me?

863
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,460
I might have lost my mind.

864
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,820
What do you mean?

865
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,820
Are you arguing with me?

866
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,580
Or are you trying to revenge on us?

867
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,500
Well,

868
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,700
we're not enemies.

869
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,860
Go to sleep.

870
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,660
I'm not leaving.

871
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,420
OK.

872
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,460
Get up.

873
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:41,860
OK.

874
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,300
Go get up.

875
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,980
Can I make a mistake?

876
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,180
輾愛 25年

877
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,260
緊急避孕 選育婷

878
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,860
2 exciting Yeah.

879
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,460
The sun shines, the warmth is cold

880
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,340
It gives me a sense of glory

881
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,020
You are the wind in the rain

882
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,420
It doesn't want me to come

883
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,020
You are always standing by my side

884
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,100
For me and you

885
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,620
But I can't stop looking at you

886
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,180
The rain is full of the sky

887
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,860
But when I have you

888
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:04,140
We can slumber forward

889
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:07,520
All the thoughts

890
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,820
All the illusions

891
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,940
Inside are you

892
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,840
Carrying a piece ofed fabric in restoration

893
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,940
Every moment is a plot

894
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,940
I see an tremor in my head

895
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,100
The MALAo in Descending

896
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,260
Every time with my♥

897
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,660
I want to tell you the most important thing

898
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,260
We will make a long journey together

899
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
I won't give up

900
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I will be here with you

901
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,260
It's you in the wind

902
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,260
It doesn't want me to leave

903
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,260
It's you standing by the fire

904
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,260
Don't be afraid of me and her

905
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,260
This is a long and difficult question

906
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,260
The sky is full of clouds and the earth is full of clouds

907
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,260
But I have you in my mind

908
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,260
How can I give up?

909
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,260
I won't give up

910
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:16,260
You gave me the future that I long for

911
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,260
It's you in the wind

912
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,260
I will be there for you

913
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,260
Even if I am the hope of the future

914
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,260
I will wait for you

915
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,260
I will wait for you

916
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:41,260
