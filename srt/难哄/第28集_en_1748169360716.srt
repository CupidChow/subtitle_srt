1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
On August 3rd, 2012

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm here.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My dad has died.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I seem to have deserve your help.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am looking for Lin Qian for hope now.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
here

24
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
Thank you

25
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,340
I'll give you the letter.

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,340
It's okay. I don't need it.

27
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Miss Zeng.

28
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,340
It's said that it was reported by the foreign wife of the suspect.

29
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,340
I'll try it.

30
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll try it.

31
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,340
Okay.

32
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,340
Zeng Yi.

33
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm Wen Yifan.

34
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm Wen Yifan.

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
I'm Wen Yifan.

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm Wen Yifan.

37
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,340
I'm the cousin of Wen Min.

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,340
Okay. I'll take you there.

39
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,340
I probably know a little bit about your situation.

40
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,340
I've had the same experience with you.

41
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,340
I jumped off the balcony with him.

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,340
I felt better when I jumped off the balcony.

43
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,340
But I felt that I was so unknowable to die with him.

44
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,340
I didn't dare to sleep every night.

45
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,340
I was so blinded by that person's face.

46
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,340
I felt so unknowable.

47
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,340
I was still young.

48
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
I cried every day.

49
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,340
I cried every night.

50
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
I felt so painful.

51
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,340
I started to feel better.

52
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,340
I couldn't even cry.

53
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,340
Why did we have to suffer like this?

54
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
Why?

55
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Can you tell me what happened that night?

56
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
No.

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,340
Uncle, you came home early today.

58
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,340
Yes.

59
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
Where is Xiaoming?

60
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
She's going to the dinner with her classmates.

61
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
She'll be back soon.

62
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,340
I'm going back to my room now.

63
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,340
The change is over.

64
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
It smells good.

65
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
What are you doing?

66
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
What are you doing?

67
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,340
Brother Dong!

68
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,340
What's wrong?

69
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
Help!

70
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Help!

71
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Help!

72
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Help!

73
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Help!

74
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Help!

75
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
Since we got married,

76
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
I felt that

77
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
I was so happy to have Chess.

78
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,340
I was also very civilized

79
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,340
and I was very proud of you.

80
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
Because that house

81
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
was sold by Chess

82
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
except for her.

83
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,340
She's a good girl.

84
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
I've been trying to

85
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,340
make her believe me.

86
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
Who are you?

87
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
Let go of me.

88
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
Say it again!

89
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Let go of me!

90
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Let go of me!

91
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Let go of me!

92
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Let go of me!

93
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Say it again!

94
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Let go of me!

95
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,340
Let go of me!

96
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Let go of me!

97
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Let go of me!

98
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,340
Let go of me!

99
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Brother Dong!

100
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,380
Who are you?

101
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,740
Your whole family isONE,

102
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
let go of me!

103
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,340
Let go of me!

104
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,340
It's alright!

105
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
Can you take that to your father now.

106
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
It's alright!

107
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,340
Take it to someone else.

108
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Let go of me!

109
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,860
Sit down.

110
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,060
Sit down.

111
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
Sit down.

112
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,340
It's okay.

113
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,140
Sit down.

114
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,940
Sit down.

115
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,540
It's okay.

116
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,260
It's okay.

117
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,740
Do you hear me?

118
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't be afraid.

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,940
You can't call the police.

120
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,340
If they call the police,

121
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,140
everyone will know about this.

122
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,940
If they do, they won't be serious.

123
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,340
Then why did you do this?

124
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,540
Right?

125
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,340
Don't say that.

126
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
You uncle.

127
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,140
You drink wine.

128
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
You are like that.

129
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,740
You are crazy.

130
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
This thing.

131
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,340
I will definitely do it for you.

132
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,140
Don't worry.

133
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,340
I will protect you.

134
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,340
I will help you to teach me a lesson.

135
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,540
Don't go to sleep.

136
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,340
Don't go to sleep.

137
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,340
They are crazy.

138
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,540
Who is he?

139
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,740
He is a clear wife.

140
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
He is my son's wife.

141
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,140
You are not in the way of the road.

142
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,540
You are now

143
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,340
in the way of my son's wife.

144
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,540
Are you crazy?

145
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,140
Okay.

146
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,740
How is he?

147
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,540
How is he?

148
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,340
What did you do to him?

149
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,140
How could he scare you to death?

150
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,740
He is in the dark.

151
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,140
You are not his dog.

152
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Okay.

153
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,140
He is your son's wife.

154
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
You said he was a dog.

155
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,340
Do you know

156
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,540
who he is?

157
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,340
How is he?

158
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,340
You are going to scare him to death, right?

159
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,740
You are going to scare him to death.

160
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,340
Don't go to sleep.

161
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,140
You are so annoying.

162
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,340
You...

163
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,940
You are so annoying.

164
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,540
When I help you to lose someone,

165
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,940
you are not annoying.

166
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,940
You are not annoying.

167
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,540
Okay.

168
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,140
Jiawen.

169
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,940
Don't be angry.

170
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,140
Jiawen.

171
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,740
I am wrong.

172
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
I will take care of you.

173
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,140
I won't do it again.

174
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,940
Okay?

175
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,140
Doctor.

176
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,340
I know that you didn't get hurt.

177
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,140
You are so mean.

178
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,340
I am fine now.

179
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,340
You...

180
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,140
I knew that I would kill someone.

181
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,740
I almost got my hand shot.

182
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,940
But the sound of the sound told me

183
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
that I must hold on to it.

184
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,340
To call the police.

185
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Otherwise, the next person to die is me.

186
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,340
You are brave.

187
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Okay.

188
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
I can't ask that kind of person.

189
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,940
But I feel much better with your husband.

190
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,340
I am not afraid of getting hurt.

191
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
I want to make the truth

192
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
not to be found.

193
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
I know.

194
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,340
We are not victims.

195
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,340
We are brave to protect ourselves.

196
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
Sister.

197
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Teacher Jian told us to hurry and go.

198
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,340
Let's go get ready.

199
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
Flower.

200
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,940
Flower.

201
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,340
Thank you.

202
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,340
If there is anything, contact me.

203
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,780
when discussing the unique characteristics and missing findings from our customer.

204
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:44,380
He was

205
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,500
I'll give the car for later.

206
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
We should be staying a long way.

207
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,500
It's okay. You don't have to.

208
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Then thank you.

209
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,300
Oh, right. My name is Wen Yifan.

210
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,900
What's your name?

211
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,900
My name is Guo Ling.

212
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,700
I just transferred to the North Central Academy.

213
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm in the fourth class. What grade are you in?

214
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm in the eighth class.

215
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Eighth class? It's a class of money.

216
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,900
Then you must be very good at math.

217
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,500
I was told about this paper that I lost it last night.

218
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,100
But I can't think of anything.

219
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,500
Send me the best answer.

220
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
What's your license?

221
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,780
He kidnapped Yang Xindou once.

222
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,820
Look.

223
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,420
What happened?

224
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,820
We need to investigate it.

225
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,540
After the PROF over임,

226
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,020
we'll watch也cause.

227
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,020
We shall step out to find it.

228
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,540
Fang Yşallah.

229
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,580
Right.

230
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,260
阻止東南圭等阮?

231
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,300
You should be careful when you were out recently.

232
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
You went to the North this time.

233
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Is this the right time?

234
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Why do you always worry about me and my old man?

235
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
You're a warm-hearted man.

236
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
You have to be careful.

237
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
And...

238
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Well...

239
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Do you remember the content of Lu Yongbi?

240
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Why did I add Lu Yongbi to your real name?

241
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
I'm quite confident to say something.

242
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
By the way,

243
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I met an old lady I knew today.

244
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
Didn't I call the police?

245
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
After moving out from the North,

246
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,300
she was left with me for a while.

247
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,300
I saw her happy today.

248
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,300
She was very happy.

249
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
She was very nice to me.

250
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
She was very nice to me when she was playing with her daughter.

251
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Let's go to the room next time.

252
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Sure.

253
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
How was she getting married?

254
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,300
We went together.

255
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I saw her boyfriend.

256
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Her boyfriend should have proposed to her.

257
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I don't know when the time will come.

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Do you have time?

259
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,300
I have a cold.

260
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
You have twenty more days.

261
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,300
What?

262
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
You won't be able to fall down soon.

263
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,300
This year's wish is to make it come true.

264
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll do my best.

265
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
I'll give you some time.

266
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
I'll hang up now.

267
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Okay.

268
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
If you're sleepy, go to bed early.

269
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Good night.

270
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Good night.

271
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
You're here.

272
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Is Uncle Guo here?

273
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Who are you looking for?

274
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm Guo Lin's friend.

275
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I want to visit him.

276
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Please come in.

277
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Auntie Guo is here.

278
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm so sorry.

279
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm a reporter from Nanwu TV station.

280
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,820
But don't worry.

281
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,260
I won't interview you.

282
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Let's go.

283
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Okay.

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Let's go.

285
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Okay.

286
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Let's go.

287
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Okay.

288
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Okay.

289
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Okay.

290
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Okay.

291
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Okay.

292
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Okay.

293
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Okay.

294
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Okay.

295
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Okay.

296
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Okay.

297
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Okay.

298
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Okay.

299
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Okay.

300
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Okay.

301
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Okay.

302
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
Okay.

303
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Okay.

304
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Let's go.

305
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm a three-year-old boy.

306
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
I'm a big boy.

307
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
I used to be busy with my work.

308
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I went to look for my kid.

309
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
He's very good at it.

310
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
He's always been good at it.

311
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
He keeps it in his room.

312
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
He knows how to hide in his room.

313
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
He writes something.

314
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
But I don't know how to support him.

315
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
He always writes what he wrote

316
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
and spends his time with me.

317
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
He doesn't have time.

318
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
That night,

319
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I quarreled with him.

320
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
That was the first time he looked at me.

321
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I didn't expect that.

322
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
That was the last time.

323
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Nian Zai, what are you doing here in the school?

324
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Why don't you come to help me?

325
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Let's go to the thing we had in Ming Tian.

326
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Dad, look at what I wrote.

327
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I really like writing things.

328
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I want to steal them!

329
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I don't care who sees those things written by you.

330
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Dad, don't say that.

331
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
My ideal is to be a small rapper in the future.

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Me too!

333
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I just want to make money and fill our stomachs.

334
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Then you can't sell things out.

335
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I can't sell them for the rest of my life.

336
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I have my own business.

337
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
What's wrong with selling things?

338
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Where are the people I sell?

339
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I can make money with my words.

340
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Just your money?

341
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Let me see.

342
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Where's the money?

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Don't go anywhere.

344
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm so stupid.

345
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I didn't think that

346
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
after he said that,

347
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
he would never come back.

348
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
These years,

349
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I've been waiting for him to give birth

350
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
to hide outside and write things.

351
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
He didn't want to come back to see me.

352
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
You said that

353
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
if I cared more about him,

354
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
he wouldn't have come out.

355
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Now he said that

356
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
he really can write a name.

357
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,500
He even wanted to say that he's a novelist.

358
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I should have been a father to him.

359
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
But

360
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I caused him to meet that young man.

361
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I shouldn't have done that.

362
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Uncle, uncle.

363
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
It's not your fault.

364
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Be calm.

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
It's just a neighbor.

366
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
My girl is not in the way.

367
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Don't worry.

368
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I'll report it to the police after the trial.

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I hope you won't be hurt by someone.

370
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
Thank you.

371
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Thank you.

372
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Hello.

373
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
How is it?

374
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
The car is still in the car.

375
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
But the car is in the car.

376
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
I think it's gone.

377
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Did it go back?

378
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
When?

379
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
It went back.

380
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
But I just called

381
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
and asked me to go to the police station to help investigate.

382
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
By the way,

383
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I might have to go back to Nanwu after the car is gone.

384
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Be careful.

385
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
You're right.

386
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I'll wait for you at home.

387
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
I'll be back.

388
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm leaving.

389
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
See you.

390
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Okay.

391
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I'll wait for you.

392
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Are you alright?

393
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm fine.

394
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
You can go back to your room.

395
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm fine.

396
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
I'll go back to my room.

397
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Don't worry.

398
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
I'm fine.

399
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I'll wait for you.

400
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
The information is on you. I'm leaving.

401
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,700
Okay, be careful.

402
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,300
Okay, okay.

403
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Bye, Yifan.

404
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,900
You can change their face.

405
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
It's very simple.

406
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Bye.

407
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,100
Okay, I'll wait for you at the office.

408
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Bye.

409
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,700
Yifan,

410
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
why didn't you report about the relatives?

411
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
The police are still investigating the case.

412
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
Let's wait for the final result.

413
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
I hope that the evil spirit will be cured soon.

414
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
I hope so too.

415
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,300
Okay, I'll leave now.

416
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
You should go home early.

417
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Take care.

418
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,500
Jia Wan Ban told me that I'll pick you up.

419
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,900
Okay, 8.30.

420
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Okay.

421
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,100
If I don't want to go,

422
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,100
I can't find you anywhere.

423
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm not well today.

424
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,700
I should go home first.

425
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,500
The overall temperature is a little lower.

426
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

427
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,500
Fang Yan.

428
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Are you going?

429
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
Yes.

430
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Jia Wan Ban is going.

431
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,900
No.

432
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Right, you're going.

433
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,700
Okay.

434
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Okay.

435
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,900
I'll go and talk to you later.

436
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Okay.

437
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Okay.

438
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
I'll go first.

439
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Okay.

440
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
I'll go here.

441
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Brother, why don't you go?

442
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm going to pick up my girlfriend to work.

443
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,300
You're a little stranger.

444
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,700
You should have a hot pot with me that day.

445
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
It's been a long time.

446
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Who are you with?

447
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,100
Two teams.

448
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,300
Okay, wait a minute.

449
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Okay.

450
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,900
I'm okay here.

451
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,500
Come pick me up now.

452
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,500
The new car is still in the car.

453
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
But the car was already left behind.

454
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
By the way,

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
the new car may be difficult to get.

456
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Hello, I want to apologize.

457
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,500
I found a suspect in the door of the house of the manor.

458
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Right.

459
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
He's so...

460
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
He's so...

461
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,700
Fortunately, he didn't run away.

462
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
What's the problem?

463
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
They're closing the car. Let go of me.

464
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Let go of me.

465
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
I'm tired after a long time.

466
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm sorry for the trouble.

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
Let's go eat.

468
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Let's go.

469
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Let's go.

470
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,100
Why didn't you answer the phone?

471
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Hello?

472
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Hello?

473
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Who are you?

474
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
I just checked the phone.

475
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
The owner of the phone just got hurt.

476
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
What?

477
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Where are you?

478
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
What's wrong?

479
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,500
I got stood here.

480
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
What's wrong?

481
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,220
Why don't you pack your

482
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,700
pants later?

483
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,500
What happened?

484
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Did you go to the emergency room?

485
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Is it a disease called disease?

486
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
I don't know about it.

487
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
I just see people suffering.

488
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I just see his hands are full of blood.

489
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
His belly is also scratched.

490
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
His blood is bleeding.

491
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
He has so many blood.

492
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
He should be sent to the hospital.

493
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Thank you.

494
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Thank you.

495
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Go.

496
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
It's okay.

497
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
It's okay.

498
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
I love you.

499
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
I love you.

500
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
I love you.

501
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Move.

502
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:43,500
You are so fast.

503
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Can I be faster?

504
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
He has so many cars.

505
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Are you okay?

506
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
I was here three years ago.

507
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I will not be safe means you should practice it

508
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
You can practice.

509
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,940
I can manage it.

510
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,700
Eat.

511
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
・

512
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,700
But here is my job.

513
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,500
I will be able to escape from you before I grow up.

514
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,180
Don't die here in the future.

515
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
Sire.

516
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,260
Are you packing for your health?

517
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,460
Aren't you going to return home tonight?

518
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:49,740
Sire,

519
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,460
Are you having another road to you?

520
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,140
No.

521
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,820
What happened today?

522
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,180
That's why...

523
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,820
Can you please park the car with me?

524
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,560
Who is boss him?

525
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,700
It's you, Sang Yan.

526
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,980
I discuss with cheer.

527
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,660
Are you alright? Where did he suffer?

528
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,080
Nothing really.

529
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,540
Just some prone skin even on hand.

530
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,620
You said nothing.

531
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,500
I saw loads of blood!

532
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,320
The law will be referring to the exactamente carEEP number of blood!

533
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,180
Nothing really matters to me.

534
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,140
Don't worry like that.

535
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,060
I've already told you it's alright!

536
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,860
I'll go home by myself later.

537
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,660
Someone must be doing some other proportions.

538
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,600
I need to take some time.

539
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,180
Where are you? I'll come find you.

540
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm at grandparents' placards.

541
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Thank you.

542
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Okay, Dr. Sun.

543
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
We'll come back to see you after you finish your wound.

544
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Okay, thank you.

545
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Hello.

546
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
May I have a question?

547
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Yes.

548
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
What's the matter?

549
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Hello.

550
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,500
May I have a question?

551
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Is there a patient called Dr. Sun?

552
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Over there.

553
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Thank you.

554
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
It's okay.

555
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Other than the hand-pulled 8-stringed,

556
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
are you okay with your stomach?

557
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
I'm fine.

558
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Here you go.

559
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
If anything happens,

560
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
please contact us.

561
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Okay, thank you.

562
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
I have a little bit of a bruise.

563
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
It's a 8-stringed.

564
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
You don't care about me,

565
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
just let me be.

566
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
You're still mad at me.

567
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Why did you go to catch him?

568
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
What's wrong?

569
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
I was wrong.

570
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
You saw him just call the police,

571
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
didn't you?

572
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
If he ran away...

573
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
You'll be the one to suggest.

574
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
What's wrong?

575
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
I don't like you being like this.

576
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
Can you stop doing this?

577
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Can you stop telling me about it?

578
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Can't you just work hard every day,

579
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
and come back safely?

580
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I don't care about these things anymore.

581
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Even if I want to let Zheng Xin De

582
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
stay in jail for a lifetime,

583
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I can't stand

584
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
your thinking.

585
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Why aren't you happy?

586
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Zheng Xin De was caught.

588
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Your aunt also paid for it.

589
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
You and your daughter are happy now.

590
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And...

591
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
this time,

592
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I'll protect you.

593
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
I really care about it.

594
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
I care about it.

595
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
I said I wouldn't let you go,

596
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
but you didn't.

597
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
I really want...

598
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
to be a man

599
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,500
who's so stubborn.

600
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,500
I'm just a little bit stupid.

601
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Why should I be so stubborn with you?

602
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
At that time,

603
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
I was young and had a crush on someone.

604
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
I was alone.

605
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I was so worried about you.

606
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I was worried about you.

607
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
But...

608
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,500
I was worried about the love

609
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
for you.

610
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I was worried about the chance

611
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
for you.

612
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I was thinking

613
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
that I'd never

614
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
ask you about time again.

615
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
But I knew I couldn't leave.

616
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I knew I could only wait for it.

617
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I was worried about the face,

618
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
the breath of the needle.

619
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I was thinking...

620
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I couldn't be the main reason.

621
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
But I regret it.

622
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I regret why I only cared about

623
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
my own

624
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
and the reason why I was so sad.

625
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I didn't try to save you.

626
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I didn't even find out

627
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
that you were hurt

628
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
by your acting.

629
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Don't talk about these things.

630
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
It's my problem.

631
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
It's not your problem.

632
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
It's the problem of Che Xingde.

633
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
So, Bansheng,

634
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
I did it this time.

635
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Can you be a little happier

636
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
and I'll take that bomb?

637
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Can it?

638
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
I'm sorry.

639
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,500
Can you stop crying?

640
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,340
I just...

641
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,420
Slow down.

642
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,860
Don't you feel bad?

643
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,420
Okay, I won't be mad.

644
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,940
I won't be mad at all.

645
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,220
But Chu Wang Jiang, what's wrong with you?

646
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,940
You're not in this mood, are you?

647
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,460
I'm not in a mood to do that.

648
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,140
When my family was looking for me,

649
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,820
you were happy to go to the company.

650
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,420
Can we do the same?

651
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,860
Okay, I'm fine. Let's go.

652
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Slow down.

653
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,740
I'm fine. I'll break your skin.

654
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Can I?

655
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
Where's the clothes?

656
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,580
It's still bruised.

657
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,460
Can I?

658
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Sure.

659
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,580
Otherwise,

660
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,420
I'll leave it here.

661
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,300
What's wrong withhig?

662
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Nothing.

663
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,120
Meanwhile,

664
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,300
I have to clean up.

665
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,540
Don't worry.

666
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,460
I will do.

667
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,860
If you want it,

668
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,280
I can work.

669
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,940
But this work is simple.

670
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,220
I've been working my butt for more than a month.

671
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
I have to put my head on the throne.

672
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
I finally caught your shadow.

673
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
It's good that

674
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220
from now on,

675
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
only the light remains.

676
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,220
I will do everything for you.

677
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
My heart will also start to doubt

678
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,220
the firmness in the ice.

679
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,220
You have never been able to seal my every effort.

680
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I have her.

681
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,220
With time,

682
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,220
we wait together.

683
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,220
The sun shines, the warmth is warm and cold.

684
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,220
It gives me a sense of luxury.

685
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,220
You are the wind in the rain.

686
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,220
It doesn't want me to come.

687
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:55,220
You are always standing by me.

688
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
You are the sun and the moon.

689
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,220
I can't stop my heart from moving.

690
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,220
The rain is full of the sky and the earth.

691
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,220
When I have you,

692
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,220
I can see the darkness in my eyes.

693
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,220
I can't stop my heart from moving.

694
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,220
I can't stop my heart from moving.

695
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Every time you leave,

696
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,220
I will always be yours.

697
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
Every time we pass by,

698
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,220
I will always be your shadow.

699
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,220
Every time we pass by,

700
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:49,220
I will be here with you

701
00:42:54,220 --> 00:43:01,220
It's you in the wind that doesn't want me to come

702
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:08,220
It's you standing by my side for me and her

703
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,220
This road is a mess, the sky is full of sand

704
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,220
But I have your voice, how can I give up

705
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:29,220
I won't give up, even if you give me the future that I want

706
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:36,220
It's you, I want to live, I want to be with you

707
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Even if I'm still looking at you, I'm still waiting for you

708
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,220
Waiting for you to exist

709
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:54,220
The darkness that can be seen in the eyes

710
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Episode 4
