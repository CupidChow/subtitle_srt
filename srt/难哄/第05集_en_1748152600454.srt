1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've loved you before.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've loved you before.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've loved you before.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've loved you before.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've loved you before.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
During the holiday,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
first, be careful.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Secondly, take a heart.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't just play around.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We're in the first place.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The second is the eye-catching.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How will it be later?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The third is coming.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You want to spend three years

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
or just spend one year?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can count on yourself.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You've spent so much effort.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In the exam, you'll see what kind of results you have.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When you're ten years younger,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you'll be especially great.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've started working hard since I was a high school student.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'll play the instrument to listen to you.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Class begins now!

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you think?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You've been home a few days ago.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you mean?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've been home a few days ago.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've been working on it a few days ago.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I like going home.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you want to follow me?

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sang Ye, where are you going?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're going to make me lose my temper!

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm not going.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to go home and study hard.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you having a fever?

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or are you going to go back to your room and get a fever?

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It doesn't matter. I'll take care of you.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you sick?

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Get out.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where are you going?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
To the airport. Let's go.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sang Ye!

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sang Ye!

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sang Ye!

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sang Ye!

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Sang Ye!

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sang Ye!

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sang Ye!

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sang Ye!

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You don't have to study hard anymore.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't play football.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to study with you.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to make a living.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm staying at this house too.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why didn't I save you in the living room?

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just said we were going to work hard.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then we'll be serious next time.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why are you still serious?

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In case you miss the chance to go to the lake with me.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Where's your house?

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll stay at your house next time.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,520
I don't care

78
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,000
There are some sausages as well as the Examina.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No weekends later

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry,

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you had a great сказ por!

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know what you eat.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't have any other choice.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You don't eat coriander and garlic.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't eat coriander and garlic.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry. I forgot.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll pick it up for you.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You and Zhao Guxi are not dead yet.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There are two of them.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We have a store and Qiao Qiao.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We start to take care of each other

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
since kindergarten.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She's used to it.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I often heard about the store called Dian Dian in Guangming.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a little bit of a game.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a little bit of a game.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When she was a kindergarten,

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
she wrote the word Wen Yifan into four dots.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's called Wen Dian Dian Dian Fan.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's Wen Dian Dian Dian Dian Dian.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's a dot in the word.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How are you doing?

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm fine.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Have a look.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Look at the store.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Dian Dian, come.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's have a look at our old couple.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go out.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Eat.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Eat and you'll get your mouth full.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go to work.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I left a package for you.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Here.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can take this.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dian Dian.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You've been through a lot

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with Sang Yanzhu.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why didn't you pay him?

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He didn't even eat just now.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He didn't even want to pay anyone.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He owed him 8 million.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Really?

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why do I feel that

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
he's quite suspicious?

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's not like that.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why don't you go to Xiang Lang's house?

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean you and Xiang Lang

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
can change the house.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let him and Sang Yanzhu.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Forget it.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's too troublesome.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm coming.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't do this.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't do this.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on, everyone.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's taste our new product.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yuzhuang, try it.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Here.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's too famous.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is Dai Xingmu fish.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is a hammer.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is a giant cake.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is...

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait a minute.

153
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who named this?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I did.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How about it?

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll...

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll give you a discount.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's play the real game.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How about it?

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's play.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Who?

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Who are you looking at?

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll give you a discount.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's okay.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We'll take care of you.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on, guests.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You go first.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come on.

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Five, six.

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Eight, six.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ten.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Open.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Open.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's the first round.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not over yet.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just open it.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's do it again.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come on.

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Nine, six.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Su Huan, you're not good at it.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're really good at it.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, we'll do it again.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're so good.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Choose a person who is in the scene.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Pick me.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't play it, can you?

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who said I can't play it?

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing?

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Little...

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Little...

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why are you so angry?

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You've played games in college before.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're so fake.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're in college.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're also in college.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did you forget me?

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're in the same department,

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and you're in the same department.

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're the double-played player of the computer.

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's enough.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll finish it.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on, play it.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Come on, play it.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Come on.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Six.

208
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Six.

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Seven.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Open.

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Open.

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's so small.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm hungry.

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you serious or a big risk?

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm serious.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll help you.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tell me the advantages of each character.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Tell me the advantages.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Money.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like a wolf.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Study well, grow up well.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Have confidence.

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Didn't you say one?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What about you?

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Cold.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Cold.

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Four.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Confidence.

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Over the head.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Twelve.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Lin Tian.

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't go up.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Fifteen.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're so bad.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm bad.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Can you open it?

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I dare not.

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Open.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Five.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You won.

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Think about it.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll say it.

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm so angry.

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Don't think about it.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Think about it.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tell me about your regret.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The regret is

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
going to the National University.

249
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We were going to go to the University of Yi He with Die Nian.

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why did you take her?

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We were going to the National University.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Die Nian was going to the South China University with me.

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Who knew she suddenly went to the University of Yi He?

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I had already reported

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the best clinical medical school in the University of Yi He.

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But my parents insisted on letting me go.

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Otherwise, I would have been in the same school

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
from kindergarten to university.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I couldn't have been in front of them.

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go in.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, you go.

262
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is the treasure we lost

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in the game of 7-1.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's the real star flower.

265
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's the treasure.

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Six.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ten.

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Ten.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Fifteen.

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Twenty-six.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Look.

272
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're done.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You finally lost.

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You're done.

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Come on.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The real star flower is called the big forget.

277
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The real star flower.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Recently,

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I went to the city of the airport.

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What a mess.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Who cares?

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yi He.

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I do that too.

284
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Your pair of arms are not quite active.

285
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you were Thai or Thai.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think so.

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If that was the case,

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I can train the kids to become spicy.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Izeiched the meeting

291
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
we drove from U...

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I heard that Sang Yan paid for it.

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Sang Yan paid?

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I said Sang Yan only gave 99% discount.

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It seems that I wronged him.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How about we write a five-star rating for him?

297
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Can't we just take advantage of others?

298
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll answer the phone.

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hello, Mr. Yi Qing.

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, I know.

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll go home now.

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I received a task at the time.

303
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to tell the country.

304
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll send you.

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Hurry up.

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Then you stay safe.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll send him a picture.

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Okay.

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Bye-bye.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Bye-bye.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then you stay safe.

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, you stay safe too.

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's go.

314
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Zhuang Xiao.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why are you still here?

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We're all invited.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I have to help you take some pictures.

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I recommend it.

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Good.

320
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll treat you to a drink.

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Stop.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What?

323
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Didn't we say

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
we won't drink together?

325
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

326
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Drink it.

327
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're a guest.

328
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You should drink it.

329
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You just lost your love.

330
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're a drunkard.

331
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm enough.

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Otherwise, I can't drink alcohol.

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm asking you.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you think it's weird?

335
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think it's a little bit.

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm asking you again.

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Why didn't you go to the dance studio?

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Did you get so many results?

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm his good friend.

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But I can't think of anything.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think he wants to stay away from everyone.

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't even have much contact.

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I thought

344
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you two have changed.

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You hate this kind of change the most.

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you believe

347
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
when I talk about love,

348
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I hope this is the last one.

349
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But now,

350
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
no one believes that love has a guarantee.

351
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you do this,

352
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you'll be under great pressure.

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I want to have something good in my life.

354
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Maybe I'll meet someone else.

355
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You'll meet someone else.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why do you ask me?

357
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm a woman.

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't talk about it.

359
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm not going back to sleep.

360
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Where are they?

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They're back.

362
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have a question for you.

363
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Do you still like to ask Fan?

364
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't know.

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know.

370
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know.

371
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I just think you still like to

372
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
find a chance to be together.

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How many times have I said it?

374
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes.

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's enough.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's not normal

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to be like this.

379
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What about you?

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll do it.

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You look at people's faces.

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They're not nose,

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
they're eyes.

384
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They're like a wolf.

385
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Are you crazy?

386
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're so stubborn.

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I've never seen you like this.

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Last time,

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you were in the high school exam.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you remember?

391
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're busy recently.

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can't contact you all the time.

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What happened to you?

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No.

395
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm busy with my phone.

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why are you here?

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm busy with my phone.

398
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm busy with my phone.

399
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm busy with my phone.

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't contact you all the time.

401
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I just want to be with you.

402
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't worry.

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll be there soon.

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll be there soon.

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Didn't you say it before?

406
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll pass after I get out of the exam.

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But I'm out.

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm in trouble.

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm in terrible danger.

410
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You've got a better result.

411
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,340
she may work though,

412
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,200
but after half an hour...

413
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,040
doesn't look起來,

414
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,340
very tears.

415
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,540
Your family's been heading out.

416
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,280
innovativeness wines.

417
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,180
Zeng Mijun has seen it.

418
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Your mother can start a new life.

419
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,820
Another smallplay of your drinking?

420
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,100
In enlarged shape's case.

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you want to eat fruit?

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Brother Hao An is waiting for you.

423
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Brother Hao An, do you want to eat fruit?

424
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What about me?

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't you want to tell me something?

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Then I'll tell you directly.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sang Yan, I hate you very much.

428
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I also hate you very much.

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You've always been here for me.

430
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm also very annoyed that I have to come out and see you every time.

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Wei Fan,

432
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm your backup.

433
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm going to a faraway place in the south.

434
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll come to Yi He in the future.

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I hope you won't come to me like this now.

436
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're back.

437
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't reply to your messages or answer your phone.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I always go to the Internet.

439
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't be so loud.

440
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm going to the South China University.

441
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
South China University!

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What's your attitude?

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm not sure.

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Brother, think about it.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We can be classmates.

446
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You know I can do it.

447
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm so happy that I can go to the South China University.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Do you know that when you said you wanted to go to the South China University,

449
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I thought, what's wrong with it?

450
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He can't answer the phone.

451
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Ding Ding.

453
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

454
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay. Why?

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't know.

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You still have the same relationship with Zhi Qian.

457
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It doesn't seem important to you.

458
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You're not interested in anything.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm curious.

460
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How can you be so careful?

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Why do you say that?

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then tell me.

463
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
How's your life after you came back to South China?

464
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's good.

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's good again.

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm asking you.

467
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
When I was abroad,

468
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
we only talked quietly.

469
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You always said something good and good.

470
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You didn't say anything about yourself.

471
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is my life boring?

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can say it if it's boring.

473
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Our world is happy and laughable.

474
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Crying when you're sad.

475
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You're like the other world.

476
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Ding Ding.

477
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Can you promise me something?

478
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Tell me.

479
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If you find it hard to talk to me,

480
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
tell me the first time.

481
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't want you to reject me.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay.

483
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Can you tell me

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
that you were in South China University

485
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
when you were in the 70s?

486
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why did you change your mind

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
to study in the medical school?

488
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you feel sorry for me?

489
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
You said you felt sorry for me.

490
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When will you be in South China University?

491
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Tomorrow is the third day of the third year.

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The third day of the third year.

493
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The fourth day of the third year.

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The fourth day of the third year.

495
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The fourth day of the fourth year.

496
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The third day of the third year.

497
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The third day of the third year.

498
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I will be in South China University.

499
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I heard that Zhang Xun's hospital is in the second floor.

500
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Then we can make a deal

501
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and work hard together to get into the fifth grade.

502
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I will be in the second floor.

503
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Please accept my request.

504
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Why?

505
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Why do you have to read it carefully?

506
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you think it's not good?

507
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Did I say I was going to pay?

508
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Give me the big difference.

509
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Zhang, this time our selection is eight.

510
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I will come with you four.

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You two will come.

512
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I will come with you four.

513
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I will come with you four.

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I will come with you four.

515
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I will come with you four.

516
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I will come with you four.

517
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I will come with you four.

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I will come with you four.

519
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I will come with you four.

520
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I will come with you four.

521
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I will come with you four.

522
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I will come with you four.

523
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I will come with you four.

524
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I will come with you four.

525
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I will come with you four.

526
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
See you next time.

527
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
The soil here is delicious.

528
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Do you want to try it?

529
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,780
Not your !!!

530
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,660
You'll never leave your own home

531
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,360
I know

532
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
Not a song

533
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,460
Spend some time in your至

534
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,640
Live

535
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,860
Finally you got your WeChat

536
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm a second grader.

537
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,160
I can learn more in the early days.

538
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,760
But I haven't done it in the early days.

539
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,360
I'll buy it on the way.

540
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,840
Bye.

541
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,880
See you.

542
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,920
Weird faces like Rowoo.

543
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:08,200
Looking good,の

544
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,360
Come in.

545
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,960
Show yourmetiquette to the Room Just Put Me Down

546
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,720
See that sound for yourselves?

547
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,620
I am hungry.

548
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
I can't talk.

549
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
I'll sit here.

550
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
How do I look?

551
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
I've been sitting here for a long time.

552
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
I'm not a good person.

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
I'm not a good person.

554
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
I'm not a good person.

555
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
I'm not a good person.

556
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
I'm not a good person.

557
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
I'm not a good person.

558
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
I'm not a good person.

559
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
I'm not a good person.

560
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm not a good person.

561
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm not a good person.

562
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I'm not a good person.

563
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
I'm not a good person.

564
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm not a good person.

565
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I'm not a good person.

566
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm not a good person.

567
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I'm not a good person.

568
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:30,720
The End

569
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Miss Wen.

570
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Someone is looking for you.

571
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Wait there.

572
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Jiang.

573
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
I thought you were still in the river.

574
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
How long have you been back?

575
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Let me get the gas first.

576
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Okay.

577
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Thank you.

578
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Miss Wen.

579
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
I heard Jiajia say

580
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
she saw you at the wetlands.

581
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I saw your gas

582
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,720
in the TV station.

583
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
I thought I would come to visit you.

584
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
What do you want?

585
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Today is not the New Year.

586
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
It's the Spring Festival soon.

587
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
How is your mother-in-law doing?

588
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
I want to introduce her to you.

589
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Let you know.

590
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm a good person.

591
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
Don't worry about me.

592
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I didn't mean that.

593
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,720
You will know when you come.

594
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Jiajia asked me to come with you.

595
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
It seems that you are getting the right one.

596
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
I...

597
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
I...

598
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I'm afraid that

599
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
you may not be in a good mood.

600
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
You may be in a bad mood.

601
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
So I...

602
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
I asked Jiajia first.

603
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm going to work.

604
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Jiajia.

605
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
You...

606
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Are you still mad at me?

607
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I...

608
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I know that I have been

609
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,720
so sorry to you in the past years.

610
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
I...

611
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
You...

612
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
How can you forgive me?

613
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
I don't blame you.

614
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,720
You have the right to be happy.

615
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I'm fine.

616
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
So...

617
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,720
So you promised to come to the house to celebrate the holiday?

618
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Let's talk about it.

619
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Go back and be cold.

620
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
You...

621
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
You...

622
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
You...

623
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
What do you want to eat?

624
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Tell me.

625
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Jiang.

626
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
You have to tell me

627
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
about the house you are in.

628
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Who is it?

629
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Xiao Wei Young.

630
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
Can't recognize him.

631
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
He has been sleeping for several days.

632
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
He is sleeping under the bed.

633
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
The house is in the past years.

634
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Dian Dian.

635
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
I'm asking you.

636
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
Did you quarrel with Sang Yan?

637
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,720
No.

638
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Then why did he keep sleeping

639
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
and not going back to work?

640
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Did he sleep at home?

641
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Yes.

642
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
If Sang Yan bullies you,

643
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
tell me.

644
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
I won't let him go.

645
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
You think too much.

646
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
I think too much.

647
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
What's wrong?

648
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
You never told me

649
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
how you got along with him.

650
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,720
We can't get along.

651
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,720
Actually, I think

652
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
we are like

653
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,720
two strangers under the same room.

654
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
And we don't have

655
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
much time to spend together.

656
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Dian Dian.

657
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Then we should say goodbye first.

658
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
You are not coming back again?

659
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
Subscribe.

660
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
don't forget to like.

661
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
See you.

662
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Okay.

663
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Dad,

664
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Turn on the battery.

665
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,420
给你搬家.

666
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,680
你凭了我什么叫 ba個 cubed?

667
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,720
Enough.

668
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Thank you for our luzto Di beauty.

669
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,960
It's not safe to go home.

670
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,880
You're a boy.

671
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
You should talk to yourself.

672
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
Don't be so serious.

673
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
You don't need to send me.

674
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
My ex is my family.

675
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,040
Qiao Qiao.

676
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,920
Where are you going?

677
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,840
Why don't you go home?

678
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,960
Who's your girlfriend?

679
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Yes, a friend.

680
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,880
Hello.

681
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,680
Who is that grandpa?

682
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,880
Are you sleeping?

683
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Come in.

684
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,160
Don't talk nonsense.

685
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,240
I thought you were here.

686
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,680
Come in and have tea.

687
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,080
Don't be polite.

688
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,720
Come on.

689
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,080
Okay.

690
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,960
Let's go.

691
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
Don't you really want to have tea?

692
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,200
Of course I don't.

693
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,520
I don't want to disturb them.

694
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,960
I will.

695
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm leaving.

696
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,200
Good night.

697
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,400
Good night.

698
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,000
Don't look.

699
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,680
Don't look.

700
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,560
You're so naughty.

701
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,560
Hello, grandma.

702
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
Are you going home?

703
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,600
I miss you so much.

704
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,440
Okay.

705
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,120
Do you have a girlfriend?

706
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,680
What's her name?

707
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,840
Her name is Wang Linlin.

708
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,920
She's my ex-girlfriend.

709
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
I miss her so much.

710
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
I miss her so much.

711
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,920
I miss her so much.

712
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,920
Her name is Wang Linlin.

713
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,160
Really?

714
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I want to see her in a few days.

715
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,880
Thank you.

716
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,960
Okay.

717
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Okay.

718
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,880
Don't worry.

719
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,360
I will definitely change you.

720
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,800
Yes.

721
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
I will never expose you.

722
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,840
Okay. Thank you.

723
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,940
One two.

724
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,720
Me...

725
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,240
sis

726
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,600
You enjoy yourself.

727
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Look.

728
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,880
In the last friendlike interview

729
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,360
did you horizontal TikTok

730
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,120
featured your credit rates?

731
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,160
Got a罵19

732
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,680
he picked up a hot moment.

733
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
He still left it in the spot.

734
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,480
God lambda!

735
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,480
In the good words

736
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,760
you've stood out

737
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,280
hot before you even were so.

738
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,920
It's a tough game.

739
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,360
It's really tough.

740
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,920
It's so tough.

741
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,160
Now everyone calls it a tough game.

742
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,920
Zhen didn't give him a massage.

743
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,360
Will it affect him?

744
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,800
No.

745
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,240
He's already lost to Tong Yun.

746
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,280
Look at him.

747
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,560
He's so handsome.

748
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,040
Go and get Liu Jie.

749
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
Liu Jie.

750
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,720
!!!

751
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,160
Do you have anything to say now?

752
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm so shy.

753
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
I hope you can be like me too.

754
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm so shy.

755
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
It's really interesting.

756
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
My sister and my mom like it.

757
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
They sent this video to our group.

758
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
You scared me to death.

759
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Why are you back?

760
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
I'm the housekeeper of the flower house.

761
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm not living here.

762
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Then why don't you open the light at home?

763
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
I'm not going home.

764
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
You should be happy.

765
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Why are there so many things?

766
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Isn't the two layers mine?

767
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,280
I can't sleep well because I'm drinking coffee at midnight.

768
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm so sleepy.

769
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I should go to bed early.

770
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm so sleepy.

771
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm so sleepy.

772
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
I'm so sleepy.

773
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
I'm so sleepy.

774
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Where's my coffee?

775
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I drank it.

776
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
It's expired.

777
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I threw it away.

778
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
You can drink it.

779
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
How much money do you need?

780
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I'll transfer it to you.

781
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
No.

782
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
If I don't deal with the refrigerator,

783
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
I don't like waste.

784
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
Then let's buy it together.

785
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
How much money do you need?

786
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
I'll ask you to help me.

787
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
We've made a deal.

788
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
All my money is...

789
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
Help me.

790
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
Help me what?

791
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Help me.

792
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Help me.

793
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Are we going to cook?

794
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,380
It's not 20 A Y

795
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,500
20 A Y

796
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:42,980
Jian Gui.

797
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,420
Guys,

798
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,180
we…

799
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,220
can't do much today.

800
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,340
Ouch.

801
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,260
Did you see Chenicao?

802
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,220
Stop talking!

803
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,260
You're in my second life.

804
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,180
Listen,

805
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,620
when can I win your heart?

806
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Okay. But I'm too lazy to go that far.

807
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,300
Then it's boring for you to live alone for the New Year.

808
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,300
I'm going to sleep for three days and three nights. I'll work overtime.

809
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,900
But I can't sleep.

810
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,300
What about Sang Yan? Has he gone home for the New Year?

811
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,100
He must have. His family is in his own place.

812
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,700
I'm afraid he doesn't have a good relationship with his family.

813
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Why did you suddenly mention Sang Yan?

814
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,900
You never told me how you've been with him.

815
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,500
We can't really get along.

816
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,100
Actually, I think we're like

817
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,500
two strangers in a room.

818
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,900
And we don't have much time to get along.

819
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Six, three.

820
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
Ten, four.

821
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,300
Ten, five.

822
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,700
Ten, fifteen.

823
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
Twenty, six.

824
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,900
What are you shouting?

825
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,900
I already said that I'm not good at it. You won.

826
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,300
What do you mean by that? Are you going to teach me or open it?

827
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,300
Can't you see that I've been helping you? Open it.

828
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,700
I can't see it at all. Can't you just say it?

829
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,700
If it wasn't for me, you'd lose every time. Open it.

830
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,100
So is it...

831
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,100
Open it.

832
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,900
I finally won.

833
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,100
I lost.

834
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,100
Sang Yan finally lost.

835
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,900
I'm so embarrassed.

836
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,500
Come on.

837
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,100
Let's call it a day.

838
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,900
I'm so embarrassed.

839
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,500
I'm so embarrassed.

840
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,300
I'm so embarrassed.

841
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm so embarrassed.

842
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,300
I'm so embarrassed.

843
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,100
I'm so embarrassed.

844
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
I'm so embarrassed.

845
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
I'm so embarrassed.

846
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,100
I'm so embarrassed.

847
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,100
I'm so embarrassed.

848
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,100
I'm so embarrassed.

849
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
I'm so embarrassed.

850
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
I'm so embarrassed.

851
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
I'm so embarrassed.

852
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,100
I'm so embarrassed.

853
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Yueni.

854
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Yang Yan.

855
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,100
Yueni.

856
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,920
quanto nila przypadara 360.

857
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,920
I'm not afraid of you

858
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,920
I'm not afraid of you

859
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I'm not afraid of you

860
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,920
I'm not afraid of you

861
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm not afraid of you

862
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
I'm not afraid of you

863
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
I'm not afraid of you

864
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
I'm not afraid of you

865
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
I'm not afraid of you

866
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
I'm not afraid of you

867
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,920
I'm not afraid of you

868
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,920
I'm not afraid of you

869
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,920
I'm not afraid of you

870
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I'm not afraid of you

871
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
They don't want me to leave

872
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,920
You're always by me

873
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Just next to me.

874
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
I first talked about it

875
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
Went to the training half a day

876
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,260
ión

877
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,920
I have the voice for you

878
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,920
How can I give up

879
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
I won't give up

880
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,700
Because you give me the blame

881
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,700
The future between you and me

882
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,700
Is the one you want to live

883
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I pretend to be the same

884
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Even if it's a wishful thought

885
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,700
I won't be lonely anymore

886
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,700
I'm afraid you'll be there

887
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:52,700
The darkness that can be seen through

888
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,700
The future between you and me
