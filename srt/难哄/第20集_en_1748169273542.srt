00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and a life of happiness.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and a life of happiness.

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and a life of happiness.

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and a life of happiness.

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and a life of happiness.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and a life of happiness.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and a life of happiness.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and a life of happiness.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and a life of happiness.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,380
If relatives and relatives play

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
They play the big part, you'll forget what they said at home when you're in your room.

23
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,020
You may not be able to remember what have happened,

24
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,120
But don't decantitta

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,620
It's a beautiful life because you wait for your death.

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,500
With friends, you live in a world

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,700
Many people's homes are happy

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,840
You are equal to one's salvation

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,740
I'm afraid that we can't live in such anA

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,440
I'm afraid that we can't live in such anA

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
Brother, hurry up and eat.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,260
Brother, hurry up and eat.

33
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,200
ï¿½

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,400
Big catch.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,300
I understand what you are saying in your room

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,480
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,500
Cut keinai

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Why don't you even care about me?

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Xiao Yan,

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Xiao Zhou and Xiao Qiu are coming to the house for a few years.

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
They are here to say hello.

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Xiao Yan.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Xiao Yan.

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
This is for you.

45
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Please have a seat.

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Thank you.

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Please have a seat.

48
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Don't you want to feed me?

49
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm going to use my phone.

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
What are you looking at?

51
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Let's go.

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
What are you looking at?

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Let's go.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Can you check the scene?

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Are you scared?

56
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I can't control myself when I'm eating.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
It's okay.

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm fine.

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll go and eat.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
I'll go.

61
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Xiao Zhou.

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Xiao Zhou.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Xiao Zhou.

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Xiao Zhou.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Xiao Zhou.

66
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Xiao Zhou.

67
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Xiao Zhou.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Xiao Zhou.

69
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Xiao Zhou.

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Xiao Zhou.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Xiao Zhou.

72
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Xiao Zhou.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Isn't there a ghost?

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
It's the same.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Is it boring?

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Let me try.

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Do you think it's fast?

78
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
I think it's fast.

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
I think it's fast.

80
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I think it's fast.

81
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
But I can't believe it.

82
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Yue Lun.

83
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Let's go.

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Milk you, I'll drive you.

85
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Keep it.

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's go.

87
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
At least, let's eat in our room.

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
It's good05, Japanese.

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Let's go.

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,100
I don't know what is the trend about this design.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,300
No, it is my own business.

92
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,300
Give me a few more questions.

93
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,500
Hello?

94
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,300
Yan.

95
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,900
I have something with you.

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,100
You call me on town hall,

97
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,220
Chang Jun Wen told me preferAPO

98
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,180
For the meeting

99
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,000
About the big year,

100
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,800
yourMANDARIN,

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,100

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,240
how do you feel about your bigger year?

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,900
You were sick,

105
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I'm not here to discuss with you.

106
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I'm here to inform you.

107
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm hanging up.

108
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What?

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Sang Yan,

110
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
why do you have a girl's voice?

111
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
It's a good thing.

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm Qian Fei.

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Sang Yan, you're so boring.

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
You said you were sending friends to see you off.

115
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I'm so tired.

116
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Did you hear the answer?

117
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Who's voice?

118
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I mean,

119
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm just a little bit tired.

120
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm not used to it.

121
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Yes.

122
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I'm almost there.

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
It's 9.30.

124
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's go.

125
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Let's watch a movie.

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Okay.

127
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I heard that the best kiss in the world

128
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
can be a lifetime kiss.

129
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Let's try it.

130
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Is it good?

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I want to watch a movie.

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'll go find it.

133
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Let's go.

134
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Do it again.

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
What?

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
My phone.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Do it again.

138
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Why do you do it again?

139
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
I forgot to take a picture.

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Where's Cheng Jing?

141
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I'm taking a picture.

142
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Right.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
What are you taking?

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm taking a picture.

145
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I'm taking a picture.

146
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm taking a picture.

147
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Xiao Ling.

148
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
You're handsome.

149
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I just see that you're a little bit flirty.

150
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Do I need to smile?

151
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Like Yueyang?

152
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I don't have any.

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
And you

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
are so smart.

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
You look like

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
a smiling man.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
You look like a star.

158
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
You look like a little mouse.

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm going to cry.

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Come closer.

161
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Come closer.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Come closer.

163
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Let me see the picture.

164
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Wait a minute.

165
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I heard you.

166
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Do you believe in this legend?

167
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Of course not.

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
But

169
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I believe in myself.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
This legend

171
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
is for you to believe.

172
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm not afraid of you.

173
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm not afraid of you.

174
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm afraid of you.

175
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
I'm afraid of you.

176
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I'm afraid of you.

177
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I'm afraid of you.

178
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm afraid of you.

179
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,500
The End

180
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Are you home?

181
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Don't wait.

182
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Brother Hao doesn't come here.

183
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I didn't wait for him.

184
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
He.

185
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Do you see him today?

186
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
I really didn't see him.

187
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I'll call him and ask him to come home.

188
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
No need.

189
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm leaving.

190
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
OK.

191
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,300
I'm leaving.

192
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Okay, take care.

193
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,700
Bye.

194
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,780
Bye.

195
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,660
Are you sure?

196
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,580
What happened?

197
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
I healthy enough find a part.

198
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,020
I will talk with others.

199
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,900
What's the matter?

200
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,860
Are you crazy?

201
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,180
Did you think

202
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,560
it'sCAV weiÃINAUDIBLE

203
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,000
When Shanghai's

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,720
About one episode

205
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,020
DrinkingéÏÎ­

206
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,200
Senior

207
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,600
Are you home?

208
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,200
Tell me when you are home

209
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,720
Are you being sweet?

210
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,580
Then I won't disturb you

211
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
I will return home

212
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,680
Yi Fan, please help me.

213
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,840
Tomorrow, I will be late for some time in the future.

214
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,920
Eat some of that.

215
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,560
Recently, I have a feeling that this was a real disaster.

216
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,460
That I also had a great first friend just that night ofodiaciÄ wasextricated.

217
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,120
Do I really deserve to be treated like this?

218
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,380
That's exact.

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,540
Have a look after I take a shower.

220
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
I'm not afraid of you.

221
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I'm not afraid of you.

222
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
I'm not afraid of you.

223
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm not afraid of you.

224
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I'm not afraid of you.

225
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm not afraid of you.

226
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
I'm not afraid of you.

227
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I'm not afraid of you.

228
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
I'm not afraid of you.

229
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
I'm not afraid of you.

230
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
I'm not afraid of you.

231
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm not afraid of you.

232
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
I'm not afraid of you.

233
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not afraid of you.

234
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I'm not afraid of you.

235
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Is this aã?

236
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,460
What's so hot about

237
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,480
this year and a littlemelon day?

238
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,940
My love isozÙØ¯.

239
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,260
I will count on you.

240
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Wait for me

241
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,760
Like the sun, warm and cold

242
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,560
Give me a light

243
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,260
You are in the wind

244
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,660
He doesn't want me to come

245
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,260
You are always standing by me

246
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
For me and you

247
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,860
This road is hard to stop

248
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,360
The sky is full of the earth

249
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,860
When I have you

250
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Mom

251
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,160
Mom

252
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,360
You know I'm in love with Jin

253
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,160
WNN is

254
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,160
I love you

255
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Do you mean it?

256
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
Mom

257
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
Wei Yifan

258
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
Wei Yifan

259
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
I love you

260
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
It's really you

261
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I miss you so much

262
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Wei Yifan

263
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Miss Qiaoqiao

264
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Uncle Ma

265
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,360
It's been a long time since you came

266
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,860
Come in, come in

267
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
What's this smell?

268
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Isn't it the new wooden head?

269
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,860
It's so small and noisy in the house

270
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,360
Where's grandpa?

271
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I can't let you in

272
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Grandpa, I'm here to see you

273
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Is there anyone who can make you angry?

274
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,860
This little wooden head is noisy and noisy

275
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,860
It's totally different from the old wooden head in the past

276
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,360
Go

277
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Grandpa

278
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,360
If it's really not okay, I'll do it myself

279
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Wait for me for a few days

280
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,360
Miss Qiaoqiao

281
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,860
Do you drink or go for tea?

282
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
I can do it, thank you, uncle Ma

283
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Grandpa

284
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,860
I think the little wooden head is still a child

285
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
It's a line everywhere

286
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,360
Maybe it's because the wooden head is the old wooden head

287
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,860
It wants to change this smell

288
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
To put it simply

289
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
It wants you to care more about it

290
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Love it more

291
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,860
The old wooden head has been with me for 17 years

292
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Why does it want to replace it for so long?

293
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,860
Grandpa, look

294
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,860
You still play with the old wooden head

295
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Is it because you haven't accepted the little wooden head yet?

296
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,860
Okay, I'll slowly adapt

297
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,860
Do you often meet your grandma?

298
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,860
I already knew about your illness with Haowan

299
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,360
Then

300
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,860
Grandma, do you know that it will be better?

301
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Do you know that

302
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
You find yourself in a person's soul

303
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
You often forget that feeling

304
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,360
What do you feel in your heart?

305
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I only know that if I suddenly forget something

306
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I will be very angry

307
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Oh, right, I will now

308
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Write down the things you want to do on your phone

309
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
This will not be forgotten

310
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
But the most important thing is

311
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
I have recently forgotten how to use my phone

312
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,360
So this thing is very important to me

313
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
People are old

314
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Many habits can't be changed

315
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,360
I will slowly get used to the little wooden head

316
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Grandpa

317
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
I can ask this little one

318
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Who is this little one?

319
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Look at this

320
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Who is this little one?

321
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Is it grandma?

322
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,360
When grandma was in love with me

323
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,360
She really liked to laugh

324
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,360
I changed her name to Xiaoming

325
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
Her name is Xiaoxiao

326
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Then we quarreled

327
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I don't call her Xiaoming anymore

328
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,360
But I forgot

329
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,360
I forgot the happy day with her

330
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,360
So I have to write it down

331
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,360
I really don't want to forget something

332
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
You can only look at the view

333
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
....

334
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
I make my wifeå¥½ç

335
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Sister

336
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Sis

337
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Didn't you find a place toä½?

338
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
If you are reported to the villa

339
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
I called a mechanic

340
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,360
I would like to have dinner with u

341
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Sister

342
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
Okay.

343
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,680
Go away.

344
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,640
No need. I want to try it myself.

345
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,480
Okay.

346
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,760
Then have you finished your homework

347
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
and sent me a photo?

348
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,360
Okay. Bye.

349
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,760
So, the woman in the movie

350
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,120
is like this.

351
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,200
I shouldn't have done this for such a boring meal.

352
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,000
The video needs to be sent from the front.

353
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,640
I'll be available later.

354
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
Okay.

355
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,920
Bye.

356
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,820
Why did I buy so muchÐ»ÑÑÑ?

357
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,720
I thought it was for her only.

358
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,240
Cousin,

359
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,520
she must like these food that I have masse.

360
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,020
Qiuqiao.

361
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,180
dian den,

362
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,120
I bought for you something.

363
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,920
Why did you buy so much?

364
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,220
I made some MRT morning when I was going to help.

365
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,060
This is for you.

366
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,180
It's what the star wants.

367
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,980
Let me draw it for you.

368
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,140
So good.

369
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,860
It looks so good.

370
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,180
Can you take a look at the front?

371
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,380
This way.

372
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,100
This way.

373
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,220
Is it okay?

374
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,380
A little bit more.

375
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,820
Okay.

376
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,580
Okay.

377
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,540
I've been picking this painting for a long time.

378
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,820
It's like you and Sang Yan

379
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
holding hands

380
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,700
and walking through cold winter together.

381
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,300
You must keep

382
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,260
enjoying it.

383
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,740
My face.

384
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,900
You look brave.

385
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,420
I bought this computer

386
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,420
I'm watching you

387
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,420
I'm in love with you

388
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,420
That's all

389
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,420
I love you

390
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,420
I love you

391
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,420
The sky and the red light are all fake

392
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,420
I'm in love with you

393
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,420
I love you

394
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,420
The sky and the red light are all fake

395
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,420
The sky and the red light are all fake

396
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:43,420
The sky and the red light are all fake

397
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:53,420
The sky and the red light are all fake

398
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,420
You're back

399
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm coming.

400
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm sorry.

401
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,660
You took a long wait to breathe the rain this time.

402
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,620
What about this?

403
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,540
Time to repay you

404
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
what you've grown with me?

405
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,700
You did it.

406
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,420
You did it yourself.

407
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,240
Am I supposed to buy it?

408
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,620
This is...

409
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,460
Mix light and dishes.

410
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,500
Or kuyo.

411
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,180
Yes, it's always great.

412
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,460
Of course.

413
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,020
I'm tasting OK with both chopsticks.

414
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,380
What else?

415
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,940
I also ordered fie encrypt

416
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,540
I can eat a hundred pieces of chicken feet.

417
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,540
Then I'll eat it.

418
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,780
You eat more.

419
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,740
We'll eat together later.

420
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,500
Don't you know that

421
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,780
you don't eat with your stomach when you cook?

422
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,580
I eat well when I cook.

423
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,980
What is this?

424
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,140
The tofu soup.

425
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,260
Here.

426
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
Let me taste it.

427
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,260
There's tofu.

428
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,100
Actually, I've always wanted to tell you

429
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,260
that this little light

430
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,660
doesn't have any effect.

431
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,340
Because the person in my dream

432
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,340
has no reaction to light.

433
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,420
It's all according to the movement of the day

434
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,500
and some feelings.

435
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,860
But I'm still very touched.

436
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,220
Let me have a look.

437
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,460
Why didn't I find you in so many dramas before?

438
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,780
You didn't eat a baby, did you?

439
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,780
But after I was with you,

440
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,820
my mood has become less.

441
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,020
It seems that pressure has become important.

442
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,540
This sentence is still very happy.

443
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,380
At least I have a little light.

444
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,060
What I mean is...

445
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,060
No matter what, you can take care of me.

446
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,740
Don't worry anymore.

447
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,500
Nothing.

448
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,340
interim Amazon

449
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,020
Wei Yi Fan.

450
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,780
No matter what,

451
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,260
I will pay for it.

452
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,700
Yes.

453
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,180
Hurry up and eat some.

454
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,920
Then what are you gonna say in the future?

455
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,760
Or I'll let you go through the aunties right now.

456
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,220
Are you really tired?

457
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
No.

458
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,420
I'm gonna run away some time later.

459
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,260
I hear that there's a pretty mark on me.

460
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,660
Then we'll play a movie later.

461
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,540
I heard that you have a good look for yourself.

462
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,420
Are you tired?

463
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,580
I'm tired. I've been sleeping for a day.

464
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
Then I'll watch it later.

465
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,100
Miss Ren.

466
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,740
Is your purpose for the movie

467
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,740
or for me?

468
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,500
You...

469
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,700
I want to watch a movie with you.

470
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,020
It's all over.

471
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,420
I can watch a movie now.

472
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,260
Okay.

473
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,460
Isn't it a horror movie?

474
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,980
You want to watch a horror movie?

475
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,580
You can change one.

476
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,660
Yes. It's a pity. It's okay.

477
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I'll go down.

478
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,380
Go down?

479
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,100
No.

480
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:56,900
I...

481
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,820
Call the wnuch.

482
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,620
No.

483
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,060
I'll tell you if he's doing okay.

484
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,740
What?

485
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,940
He's...

486
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:20,960
Just

487
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,580
effing funny.

488
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:22,840
Okay.

489
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:23,860
I should say my name.

490
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
You've talked to your relatives for a long time.

491
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
They're all in our house.

492
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,860
They're still not leaving.

493
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,860
Can't you see them?

494
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
How can you be close to them?

495
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Take them away.

496
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
And

497
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,860
your uncle has been talking to mom.

498
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,860
He's still married.

499
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,860
It has nothing to do with us.

500
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Xiao Zhou, I think

501
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
you should be more careful.

502
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
You know me?

503
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
My dad lost his phone.

504
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
They're all in our house.

505
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
Why?

506
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
Why did you suddenly think of this?

507
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
No.

508
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
It's a movie.

509
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Then, let's eat fruit.

510
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
I'll go get it.

511
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
When will you give up?

512
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Next year.

513
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
You've been giving up since you were a kid.

514
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Mr. Qian told me

515
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I can't stay today.

516
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Are you going home?

517
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
No.

518
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Then I'll forget about it.

519
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
I'll go home.

520
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Then I'll forget about it.

521
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Forget about what?

522
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
When will I come back to you?

523
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,860
Why are you back?

524
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Didn't you come back

525
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,860
before you left?

526
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
I have too many relatives at home.

527
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
I can't stay at home.

528
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
Then you came back

529
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
on your birthday.

530
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
Do you like it?

531
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Or not?

532
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,860
Or what?

533
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860
I came to see you.

534
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
Really?

535
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Suo Yan.

536
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Suo Yan.

537
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Don't you want to ask

538
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
why I didn't come back

539
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,860
to celebrate my mother's birthday?

540
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
Of course I'll tell you when I want to.

541
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,860
The information

542
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
that Shi Zhen sent me

543
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
just now

544
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
was that my mother asked me

545
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,860
whether I should go back to celebrate my mother's birthday.

546
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
But I'm not good

547
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,860
at bullying them.

548
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,860
My father

549
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
just passed away

550
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,860
when he was not here for long.

551
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
My mother passed away.

552
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
This is Uncle Zheng.

553
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Your father was always

554
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,860
helping when he was sick.

555
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Why didn't you say anything?

556
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
You're a child.

557
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
You don't understand.

558
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I...

559
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
I...

560
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
I...

561
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
Why are you so stubborn?

562
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
What's wrong?

563
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Nothing.

564
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
I suddenly got nervous.

565
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,860
Luckily, I drank it every day.

566
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Why didn't you

567
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
bully your mother

568
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,860
and your father

569
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
after that?

570
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
I didn't get along well.

571
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I went to my grandmother

572
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
after a long time.

573
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Your father

574
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
was so stubborn.

575
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
He loved my father

576
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
and so did I.

577
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,860
He loved me.

578
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
He was always happy.

579
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
His father was so stubborn.

580
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
My grandmother was in a bad health.

581
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
I was sent to my uncle's house.

582
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,860
I seldom heard you say that.

583
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
You were a sister.

584
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,860
When we were having dinner,

585
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,860
he must have been very familiar with you.

586
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
He was so happy.

587
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
He was always

588
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
touched by my hand

589
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
when he was young.

590
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
He was the best

591
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
when he was using things.

592
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
He never drank.

593
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,860
Even if he had any problems

594
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
or difficulties,

595
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
he always asked others

596
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
to solve them.

597
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,860
And I'm older than him.

598
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,860
I should

599
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
make my sister...

600
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Make your sister

601
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
go home?

602
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
You never let her know.

603
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Go home.

604
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
Can you eat more?

605
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,860
Your bones are hurting.

606
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
When will you get fat?

607
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Who can talk so well?

608
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Can't you find a way to get fat?

609
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Are you not feeling well?

610
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
You want me to get fat again

611
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
and you want to pick other people's grass.

612
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
Then you should be

613
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
careful with my life.

614
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Your hands are cold.

615
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
Don't forget

616
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
those words.

617
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
And those

618
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
words that don't come to my head.

619
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Do you understand?

620
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
You think that

621
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
everything in this house is a mess?

622
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Everything.

623
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Everything.

624
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
You picked them all.

625
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
And

626
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,860
what do you mean

627
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
that you've been used to it?

628
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
Even if you pick

629
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
the right person,

630
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Guo,

631
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
you should use

632
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
the best you can.

633
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
Guo.

634
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Guo.

635
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
I'll find you

636
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
at the most vulnerable moment.

637
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
I'll protect you.

638
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
I'll protect you.

639
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
I'll protect you.

640
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
I'll protect you.

641
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
I'll protect you.

642
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,860
I'll protect you.

643
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
I'll protect you.

644
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
I'll protect you.

645
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
I'll protect you.

646
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
I'll protect you.

647
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
I'll protect you.

648
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,860
I'll protect you.

649
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I'll protect you.

650
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,860
I'll protect you.

651
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
I'll protect you.

652
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,860
I'll protect you.

653
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,860
I'll protect you.

654
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,060
But I'll

655
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,360
ìager.

656
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,860
I'll fight you

657
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,860
I'll protect you

658
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,860
I'll be there to protect you

659
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,860
I can't bear to see you, my beautiful girl

660
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,860
I'll fight you

661
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,860
I'll protect you

662
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,860
I love you

663
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,860
I love you

664
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,860
I love you

665
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,860
I love you

666
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,860
My heart is still warm

667
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,860
I'm still suspicious of the firmness that I'm chasing

668
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
But you never give up

669
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,860
My every effort has its meaning

670
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:54,860
I'll wait for the time to come

671
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,860
The sun is shining, the warmth is warm

672
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,860
You gave me a good time

673
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,860
You are the wind and rain

674
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,860
It doesn't want me to come

675
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,860
You are always standing by me

676
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,860
You are the rainbow and rainbow

677
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,860
I can't stop looking at you

678
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,860
The rain is full of the sky and the earth

679
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,860
But I have you

680
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:33,860
I can stand the darkness in front of me

681
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,860
All the thoughts and memories are you

682
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,860
We are all in the spring and every step is a season

683
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Every rain and rain fall down and scattered you

684
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,860
The time is fixed

685
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,860
Every white and white news I want to tell you

686
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,860
We will make a journey together

687
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,860
I won't give up

688
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:06,860
I will be here with you

689
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,860
You are the wind and rain

690
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,860
It doesn't want me to come

691
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,860
You are always standing by me

692
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,860
You are always standing by me

693
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,860
You are always standing by me

694
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,860
You are the rain and rain

695
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,860
I can't stop looking at you

696
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,860
The rain is full of the sky and the earth

697
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,860
But I have you

698
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,860
I can stand the darkness in front of me

699
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,860
You are the rainbow and rainbow

700
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,860
I can't stop looking at you

701
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,860
The rain is full of the sky and the earth

702
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:00,860
But I have you

703
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,860
I can stand the darkness in front of me

704
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,860
You are always standing by me

705
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,860
You are always standing by me

706
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,860
You are always standing by me

707
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,860
You are always standing by me
