1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I once loved you.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Is this Sang Yang?

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hurry and get up.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go and have a look.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Look, he's so cool.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's so white.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He's so strong.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I want to be a fake one.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go up and have a look.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sang Yang.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Look.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Look at his face.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Look, look at your small face.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't hear you.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's wrong?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He said I'm pretty.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
It's good to see you. You want to call me WeChat?

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,120
Is this something you often have?

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
I'm sure it's going to be a contrast.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,720
Who wants to come? What's your plan?

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
I have no plan. What about you?

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm going back to Yi Hebei. If you don't come back with me,

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
I'll be very upset with you.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Say it again.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,840
Say it again. You're begging me.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
Are you going or not?

41
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,720
Are you going or not?

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
Ah Jiang!

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,240
Ah Jiang!

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,280
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,600
Did you find me anything?

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,880
If you're fine, I can't come to see you anymore.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
I brought you some chili sauce.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,960
It's the one you loved when you were little. I brought you some specialties.

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,520
I haven't had it for a long time.

50
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,080
It's fine. You can have it with your friends. They'll definitely like it.

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Hurry and give it to me.

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,400
Thank you.

53
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,920
Thank you.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
I'll go first.

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,080
Wait a minute.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,840
Mom!

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Hurry and give it to me.

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
We're going to the shopping street. Hurry up.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,920
Okay, I'll be right here.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,880
What's your name?

61
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,440
Sister, what's so good about this box?

62
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
Recommend it.

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
No, Uncle.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,600
Why don't you say it when you study in Yi He University?

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, I'm fine now. You should go back and rest.

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,520
Let's go.

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,080
You're so cute.

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,600
Look at this little boy.

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Look.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Okay.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm so far away.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Yeah.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
You're so cute.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Little boy, you're so cute.

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Look at that little boy.

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Sister, do you want to hug me?

77
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Sister can't hug you. I can only hug you.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Who said I was going to hug my sister?

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
I said I was going to hug my little baby.

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
No, you can't.

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Did you wash your hands?

82
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
You have to wash your hands to hug me.

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I did.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
I just wiped my feet with a towel.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
You can hug him.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll hug you.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Be careful.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Be careful.

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Slowly.

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Yes.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I'll hug you.

92
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll hug you.

93
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Okay.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
It's 56 days left.

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
lol

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I knew it.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm worried about you.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
How about it?

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
A quick statement.

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
He was working hard.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Do you not have any progress?

102
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Did some people mess with you?

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
No.

104
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
They probably didn't know I was chasing them.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Did the two of you have an learningHow?

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
No, just joking.

107
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Are you just pretending?

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I don't know where to start.

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
You can start from his hobby.

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Hobby?

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Can you play it?

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
You give up skill.

113
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
How many points do you mean?

114
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Can you play it in a hurry?

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
What?

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I paid you.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
You're so strict.

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm not strict with you.

119
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I'm not strict with you.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You're so strict.

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
What's wrong?

122
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Nothing.

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You seem to be

124
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
like someone else

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,600
when you play games.

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Go on.

127
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll take a rest.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Getting along well

129
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
is the best for playing games.

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Thieves

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
deal with reports

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
on social norms.

133
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Kids

134
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
don't have 밥

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
to eat for a game.

136
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Is this the game

137
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
午最近 he play frequently these days?

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Is it so?

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
It is fun.

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
It was played when I was in university.

141
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Then it's not played for long.

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
It gets a little boring to play about.

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
You play it by yourself?

144
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,200
You play it with him?

145
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
What's wrong with you?

146
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm so bad at this.

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm afraid he'll say that.

148
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,120
How is that possible?

149
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,080
You play games with boys.

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,560
They will have a sense of humor.

151
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,120
So no matter how bad you play,

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,560
they won't say anything about you.

153
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
No.

154
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,240
He won't.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,520
Because I'm the one who's right.

156
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,200
Hello.

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,640
Hello.

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,160
Yifan, you want to play this game too?

159
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,280
If no one plays this game before,

160
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,200
it will be very slow.

161
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Do you want me to play it?

162
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,560
No, I don't want to play it.

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,080
Playing this game by yourself

164
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,720
is not a good idea.

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,400
Yes.

166
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,440
Okay.

167
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll be there at any time.

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
If Yifan needs someone to play it,

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
she can call me anytime.

170
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,200
Have you finished your lunch?

171
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
I just finished it.

172
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
Have you finished your lunch?

173
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,600
I think...

174
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,800
I haven't.

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
Okay, I'll be there.

176
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,320
Thank you.

177
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Thank you.

178
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,600
Sang Yan.

179
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Why are you going?

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,640
It's still cold.

181
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm going home after work.

182
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,560
Home?

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,040
Did you forget?

184
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,800
You promised me.

185
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,760
You can work overtime today.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Today is not the day.

187
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,640
Of course it's the day.

188
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
Today is the shareholders' meeting.

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm meeting the former members of the team.

190
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
It's just us.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,120
Let's go.

192
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,160
Let's go.

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,760
Let's go.

194
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,800
Here we are.

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,960
Let's go for a drink.

196
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Let's go for a drink.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,640
Let's go for Sang Yan.

198
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,320
Here we are.

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,760
Here we are.

200
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,240
Here we are.

201
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
Who's drinking?

202
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,080
Boss Fang.

203
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,240
The former boss has been

204
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
very suspicious lately.

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,920
He's very suspicious.

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
He must be very suspicious.

207
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,440
Recently,

208
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
shareholders

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
can't find your idol.

210
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Tell me.

211
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Tell me the truth.

212
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,640
Tell me the truth.

213
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm afraid you're not being fair.

214
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,760
He's so jealous.

215
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,240
He's so bold.

216
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,080
No.

217
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
What does he mean?

218
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
He said

219
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,840
there's a girl

220
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,120
who's been chasing him for a while.

221
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,720
She's been doing something.

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
Are you crazy?

223
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
You're not the first one to be chased.

224
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,920
You didn't look so obvious before.

225
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,520
Right?

226
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,480
Do you like her too?

227
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
Yes.

228
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,680
What's wrong with you?

229
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,320
You're so fake.

230
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,040
Who?

231
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm just a little girl.

232
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,960
You like her too.

233
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,040
You're still waiting for her

234
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
to come after you.

235
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,480
Please keep an eye on me.

236
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
You're a big man.

237
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,040
You can't keep an eye on her.

238
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Qian Fei.

239
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
I don't need you to teach me.

240
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
You're just one of my friends.

241
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
You're a student.

242
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,840
Come on.

243
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
Come on.

244
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,080
I'll do it.

245
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,000
Sang Yang, you're so naive.

246
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why do you always

247
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
put your tongue on people's mouth?

248
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
Besides, it's been hundreds of years.

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,280
You're just a little girl.

250
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Is she the new intern

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
in our company?

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,280
She's still a student.

253
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
She's pretty.

254
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,440
Good for you.

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,720
She's a good girl.

256
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,040
She's a student.

257
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,160
I see.

258
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,240
She likes to be small.

259
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,960
A little bit.

260
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,800
She likes to be small.

261
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
Love is

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
nothing to do with a little girl.

263
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,160
Right, Brother Xue?

264
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,400
You're two children.

265
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
You're five, six, seven, eight,

266
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,080
nine, ten years old.

267
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
So it's okay.

268
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,960
She's not the intern.

269
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,480
Is she the girl

270
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,200
who lives with you?

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,280
No.

272
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,000
What's your plan for her?

273
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
What's my plan?

274
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,800
She wants to make me a girl.

275
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
How can I do that?

276
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,480
Just wait for her to make me a girl.

277
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
Don't be so shameless.

278
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,840
You're so cheeky.

279
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
I've always said that.

280
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,520
Why should I?

281
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,920
Is she the girl?

282
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
You're a girl too.

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,400
I...

284
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,080
Just...

285
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,240
Su Hao An.

286
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Are you having a meeting?

287
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,760
Is it inconvenient?

288
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
It is.

289
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,920
It is.

290
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
Why is it inconvenient?

291
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,880
Who is it?

292
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
What's wrong?

293
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
You're scared.

294
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,160
What's your name?

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
It's Mei Hao.

296
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm happy to be here.

297
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,800
What's your yummy food?

298
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,000
Grandpa's watching you.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
Oh, that's good.

300
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,480
By the way, I might have to move to a new house.

301
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,560
Then you must be happy to move to a new house.

302
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't trust me.

303
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,920
Then did you tell Grandpa that you know about his illness?

304
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,000
I think that after a few days,

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,240
after all, Mu Tou just left. Now, he's not the new one.

306
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,320
How could it be the new one? He's concerned.

307
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,080
Fine. I'm not qualified to do this to you.

308
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,000
You can control me.

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,760
You're so stubborn. You still want others to control you?

310
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,240
You have to be treated like a rich man.

311
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,200
No. What I mean is,

312
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,760
you've helped me a lot in this matter.

313
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,200
And your advice is very useful.

314
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,360
And you've never told me about money.

315
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,560
Am I that kind of person?

316
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,080
That's not the reason. So I'm more moved.

317
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
And...

318
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,080
I feel that it's your true nature.

319
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
What are you talking about?

320
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,880
I almost forgot what I was looking for.

321
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Forget it.

322
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
How about I go to see Grandpa tomorrow?

323
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,040
Sure. What's wrong?

324
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,880
I found Mu Tou.

325
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
I'm sorry.

327
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,560
I'm sorry.

330
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
I'm sorry.

331
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm sorry.

332
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
I'm sorry.

335
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
I'm sorry.

336
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
I'm sorry.

337
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm sorry.

338
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
I'm sorry.

339
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
It's okay.

340
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Did you sleep?

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Not yet.

342
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
I miss you.

343
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
I want to hear your voice.

344
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm fine. Go to sleep.

345
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,560
I've been upset with you several times recently.

346
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
It's all my fault.

347
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I didn't think about it during the Spring Festival.

348
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,560
I should have thought you didn't like to come here.

349
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
I asked you to stay in there.

350
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
You left me for so long.

351
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
I really had to.

352
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
How about this? Tell me where you are.

353
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I'll go there and make you something delicious.

354
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
I told you I won't go there.

355
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I can't afford to stay at your house.

356
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Then...

357
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Is it because of your aunt?

358
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm not old. I'll get up early tomorrow.

359
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Dating

360
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
He must be hungry.

361
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,060
He probably knows.

362
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm not afraid of the world

363
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
I'm afraid of the world

364
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
I'm afraid of the world

365
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
I'm afraid of the world

366
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm afraid of the world

367
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I'm afraid of the world

368
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm afraid of the world

369
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm afraid of the world

370
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I'm afraid of the world

371
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm afraid of the world

372
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm afraid of the world

373
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm afraid of the world

374
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
I'm afraid of the world

375
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm afraid of the world

376
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
I'm afraid of the world

377
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Can't wait

378
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,200
Can he handle пор conversion

379
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,160
I want to draw aруг

380
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I'll hide my tears

381
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,100
Let's ask her

382
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,940
Can you chase me away?

383
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,700
In the clear sky?

384
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,780
Or I won't listen to you?

385
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,580
If you don't want to say goodbye to me,

386
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,340
I'll leave it to you

387
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,940
no matter what.

388
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,340
I think you will not press you goodbye forever.

389
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:21,500
Then see where he used to его

390
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I hope you won't be like before.

391
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,580
Didn't you come back yesterday?

392
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,140
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:05,860
You...

394
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,460
Did you come back last night

395
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,260
when I was in the desert?

396
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,300
So you slept outside by yourself?

397
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,900
Then you should have helped me

398
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,060
get out of here and

399
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,740
locked the door.

400
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,820
I'm sure I can't get in.

401
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,260
You should have saved me.

402
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,820
What about that book?

403
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,020
Yes.

404
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,940
In order to get in,

405
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,140
I can't do anything.

406
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,620
If I really get in,

407
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,020
you'll lock the door, right?

408
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
Come on.

409
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,260
Now you...

410
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,300
You understand, right?

411
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,100
If you don't lock the door,

412
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,460
it'll be the same as now.

413
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,460
What's the situation?

414
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
I'm not sure.

415
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
I'm not sure.

416
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm not sure.

417
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,780
I'm not sure.

418
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm not sure.

419
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm not sure.

420
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
I'm not sure.

421
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,780
I'm sorry to you.

422
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,780
I'm sorry to you.

423
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,100
It's nothing.

424
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I'm sorry to you.

425
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,260
I want to ask you

426
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,660
to close your eyes.

427
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
I want to hold you

428
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,300
in every moment of weakness.

429
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,300
I'll hold you.

430
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I'll hold you.

431
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,300
I want to hold you in every moment of weakness.

432
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
I can't hold you.

433
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
I'm not sure.

434
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm not sure.

435
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm not sure.

436
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm not sure.

437
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Next time,

438
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
I'll go to work.

439
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I love you.

440
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
It's time.

441
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
Am I brave?

442
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
It's time.

443
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
It's time.

444
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
It's time.

445
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
It's time.

446
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
It's time.

447
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
It's time.

448
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
It's time.

449
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
It's time.

450
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,300
It's time.

451
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
It's time.

452
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
OK.

453
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
I suggest that

454
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
one by one

455
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,300
you take the medicine

456
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,300
and have one in your hand.

457
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
OK, OK.

458
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Think so?

459
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Let's eat together.

460
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Did you get this?

461
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
How is Grandpa's mood?

462
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
He's in a hurry.

463
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
I'm done.

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
I'll send him a gift later.

465
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
He'll be even more unhappy.

466
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Are you that timid?

467
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Who's timid?

468
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
Woodhead, come here.

469
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Come here.

470
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Doggy.

471
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Here.

472
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I found this in the zoo.

473
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
It's only a year old.

474
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Did you raise it?

475
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
It's really called Woodhead.

476
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
I shouted in the middle of a group of dogs.

477
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
Woodhead, Woodhead.

478
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Then it was back.

479
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
And it was alive.

480
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
It kissed me.

481
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Kissed you?

482
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Yes.

483
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
But Grandpa,

484
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
it's not black.

485
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
It's half black.

486
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Are you angry?

487
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
No, I'm not.

488
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
Woodhead.

489
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Woodhead.

490
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Don't be afraid.

491
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Woodhead.

492
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Don't be silly.

493
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
The house is expensive.

494
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Come here.

495
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Woodhead.

496
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
So,

497
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
we're a big girl.

498
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
But you're in a hurry.

499
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Now, the best thing is to show up.

500
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Let's see if you can give me a chance.

501
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Woodhead.

502
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
Good boy.

503
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
Come here.

504
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
I'll hold it.

505
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Come on.

506
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
That hand.

507
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
That hand.

508
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Good boy.

509
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Good boy.

510
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Woodhead.

511
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,300
Good boy.

512
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Good boy.

513
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Come here.

514
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Come here.

515
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I've been playing this game recently.

516
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Really?

517
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
When?

518
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
Recently.

519
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,300
It's fun.

520
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Good.

521
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
I've got new equipment.

522
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Can I have a word with you?

523
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Sure.

524
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
What's your position?

525
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm a netizen.

526
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
How good?

527
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm a netizen.

528
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm a netizen.

529
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
I'm a netizen.

530
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I'm a netizen.

531
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm a netizen.

532
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
How good?

533
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Come on.

534
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Next time.

535
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
I have some work to do.

536
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
By the way,

537
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
are you free this Friday?

538
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
What's wrong?

539
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,300
I heard from my colleague

540
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,300
that your company has a good restaurant nearby.

541
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
If you have time,

542
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,300
we can go there together.

543
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,300
You're finally going to pay me back.

544
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
So, are you free?

545
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
I'll go to your company

546
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
on Friday.

547
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Because

548
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,300
I might have to leave early

549
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
so I can go to you.

550
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
If it's not convenient,

551
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
you can see me directly at the store.

552
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
No, I'll come back that day.

553
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
We'll meet later.

554
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
continents

555
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Cheer me up on Friday.

556
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
What do I need to do?

557
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
I have two tickets for me

558
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
to attend today's meeting.

559
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
Do you plan to play as a good guy by Tuesday?

560
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
What?

561
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm still young.

562
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,300
That's why you need to be white.

563
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Yifan.

564
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,300
Sister.

565
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Who do you want to see?

566
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
I'll go to the rescue.

567
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Have you been here for a long time?

568
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
No.

569
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Let's go.

570
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,300
By the way,

571
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
didn't you come back for something?

572
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
What's wrong?

573
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Air is...

574
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
I'll help you to get the hang of it.

575
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,300
Okay.

576
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,300
We'll go to the Spring Garden.

577
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Spring Garden?

578
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,300
What's wrong?

579
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Don't you like it?

580
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
No.

581
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I can change it.

582
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,300
No.

583
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
What's the smell?

584
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,300
It's very strong.

585
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Eat hot pot.

586
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Okay.

587
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
It's barbecue.

588
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,300
It's smelly.

589
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Spring vegetable.

590
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
What?

591
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I asked you to eat before.

592
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
You said you don't like it.

593
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
It's really hard.

594
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
I didn't like it at that time.

595
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
I didn't like it at that time.

596
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,300
I love it now.

597
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Don't you want to fight?

598
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I'm going to take a break.

599
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Hello, can I have a lunch?

600
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
We have a delivery.

601
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Okay, you can go.

602
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Where do you want to sit?

603
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Where do you want to sit?

604
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
I can sit anywhere.

605
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Then, where is the window?

606
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Okay.

607
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Yan.

608
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
Yan.

609
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
You didn't come here?

610
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You are here.

611
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
What?

612
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
We have booked it.

613
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
Since we are here, let's eat together.

614
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
As our boss,

615
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
we will not talk.

616
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
We won't talk.

617
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Let's go.

618
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
Let's go.

619
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Let's go.

620
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Here we are.

621
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
What's the matter?

622
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
It smells good.

623
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Okay.

624
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,300
Yan.

625
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
I'm looking forward to it.

626
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Yan.

627
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Yan.

628
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
Come and sit.

629
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Yan.

630
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Yan.

631
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Yan.

632
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Yan.

633
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Yan.

634
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Yan.

635
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Yan.

636
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
You know each other?

637
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
My sister.

638
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
So lucky.

639
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
My sister.

640
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
You have a sister?

641
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh, that's it.

642
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Yan, let me introduce you.

643
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
This is...

644
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Sister-in-law.

645
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
No, I'm her...

646
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
friend.

647
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,300
Friend?

648
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,300
Yan, you're really a friend.

649
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
I'm not a friend.

650
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
I didn't hear you.

651
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Here's the food.

652
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
I'll go with you.

653
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Who's more?

654
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
It's mine.

655
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Who hasn't drunk yet?

656
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,300
Yan, come and see if you can drink.

657
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Give me the solution.

658
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
Why don't you like it?

659
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
You can drink whatever you want.

660
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Yan,

661
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
look at what you want to drink.

662
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,300
We ordered early.

663
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
What do you want to add?

664
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Look.

665
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
What do you want to drink?

666
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
I'll drink water.

667
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,300
You don't need anything else.

668
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Okay.

669
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,300
It's rare for us to be together.

670
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Cheers.

671
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,300
Come on.

672
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Yes, yes.

673
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
It's not easy to enjoy the food of Boss.

674
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
We can't make a promise.

675
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
We have to make a promise.

676
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
I'll drink it.

677
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
I'll drink it today.

678
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Did you have a meeting today?

679
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Yes.

680
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
It's late.

681
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Who knows Boss will be off work?

682
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
He said he has a date.

683
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
What a coincidence.

684
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
He's sitting with him today.

685
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
What's wrong?

686
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Don't think about the past.

687
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,300
This is good.

688
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Here, have some.

689
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
I didn't expect to meet you here.

690
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,300
I just came to the internship.

691
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
You know me well.

692
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
At the same time,

693
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
you told me

694
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,300
you didn't give us the face of manager.

695
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
He came to see me

696
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
and said

697
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
I'm a manager.

698
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
I'm just a normal person.

699
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
What do you mean?

700
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
You don't pick money.

701
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
And I'm thinking

702
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
don't waste it.

703
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Why don't you drink it yourself?

704
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,300
I don't like it.

705
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
You used to...

706
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
Then

707
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
just tell me a few things.

708
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
I'm afraid I can't even

709
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
get to the internship.

710
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Does it have anything to do with me?

711
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm just afraid.

712
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,300
Just tell me a few things.

713
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
What's wrong?

714
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
I don't have such a big ability.

715
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,300
Wait for me.

716
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
Wait for me.

717
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Listen to me.

718
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Are you leaving?

719
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
You're leaving so soon.

720
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Are you afraid of me?

721
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
Are you chasing you in the eyes of manager?

722
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,300
How can you still see the computer?

723
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
No.

724
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
That's it.

725
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
I haven't started chasing.

726
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,300
You two are still in love.

727
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Right?

728
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
Anyway, he must be interested in you.

729
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
I'm just going to chase him.

730
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
He's tall, handsome,

731
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
rich and cool.

732
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
And he's the fastest

733
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
in the company.

734
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
But it doesn't matter if you two are like this.

735
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
I don't want to chase him

736
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
after I finish the job.

737
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
After all, I'm not bad.

738
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
He's interesting to me.

739
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
It's useless to ask.

740
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
You don't care about me, do you?

741
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
He treats you and others differently.

742
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
I don't want to say it.

743
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
But it doesn't matter.

744
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
What's the point of it?

745
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
I'm not interested in this kind of nonsense.

746
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,300
I must be favored.

747
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
What do you think?

748
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
I'm going back.

749
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
Wei Fan,

750
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
let's put on a WeChat.

751
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
You didn't answer me in the past.

752
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,300
You haven't contacted your mother for a long time.

753
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
Listen,

754
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
because you don't care about him,

755
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,300
he's been in a bad mood lately.

756
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,300
You two are related.

757
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
You're like this.

758
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
You're the one who cares about me.

759
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,300
You don't have to blame him.

760
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,300
Then why should I add your WeChat?

761
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
I don't want to talk to you.

762
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
It's nothing.

763
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
Why not?

764
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,300
What's the point?

765
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,300
As for your mother,

766
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
your biological daughter

767
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,300
is not as good as my step-daughter.

768
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
You're really more like your biological daughter than me.

769
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Who is he?

770
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
This is my home.

771
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
I don't want him to eat on this table.

772
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
I want to go to the bathroom.

773
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
It's done.

774
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Do you want to go down?

775
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,300
You eat first.

776
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
We still have to eat.

777
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,300
You two want to secretly have a date?

778
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Yes.

779
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
I didn't expect that the manager is so good.

780
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
He's still in love with you.

781
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
Wait.

782
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Let's take some photos.

783
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Otherwise, we won't have a chance to send our friends.

784
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Come on, let's take a photo.

785
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Let me close it.

786
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Come on.

787
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Close it?

788
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
Do you know what your plan is?

789
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
I want to steal it.

790
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Come on.

791
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
I'm ready.

792
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
I'll put you on the other side.

793
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Come on.

794
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Let's take a photo.

795
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Okay.

796
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,300
Send the photos to everyone first.

797
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Okay.

798
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
No problem.

799
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,300
I'll take care of them for you later.

800
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Let's go.

801
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Bye, Yan.

802
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Bye, Yan.

803
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,300
Can you send me the photo of today?

804
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
I'll send it to you.

805
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Okay.

806
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
Hello, Mr. Qin.

807
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
Yifan, there's an emergency.

808
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
Beiyu has a broken throat.

809
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
We have to go to the interview right away.

810
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
Okay, I got it.

811
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
I'm going to work early.

812
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
I'll be there soon.

813
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,300
Okay.

814
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Are you going to Beiyu?

815
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Have you seen the news?

816
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
Is it dangerous to work?

817
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
I don't know.

818
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,300
When will you come back?

819
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,300
I think it will take a few days.

820
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
I don't know

821
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,300
if I can bring him back before his birthday.

822
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Can you come back early?

823
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,300
I have something to tell you.

824
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,300
Can't you tell me now?

825
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:08,300
Now, I'm afraid you can't work well now.

826
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
You go ahead.

827
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I'm going to be there.

828
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,300
I have to go.

829
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Okay.

830
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
See you.

831
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
I'm going to be there now.

832
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Okay, I'll see you later.

833
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Bye, Mr. Qin.

834
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Bye, Mr. Qin.

835
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Bye.

836
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Okay.

837
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Bye.

838
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm going to be there soon.

839
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,300
Bye.

840
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,820
What else do you want to say?

841
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,620
Su Tian.

842
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,700
Do you want to be a soldier for a while?

843
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,020
I'm fine.

844
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,220
I'm not very sleepy.

845
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,980
Mr. Qian, if you're sleepy,

846
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,100
tell me. I'll help you.

847
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,420
Thank you.

848
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,580
I sent you a photo.

849
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,300
Where's the breakfast?

850
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,180
I've added you a few hundred times.

851
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,460
You don't have any reaction at all.

852
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,260
You didn't care about the photo.

853
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,860
You're so naive.

854
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,360
Everyone,

855
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,780
I'll protect you.

856
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,220
Forgive me,

857
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,260
but today is business day.

858
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,220
When you're done keeping a 911 going,

859
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,300
bring my fry to the hospital.

860
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,740
You have to protect me.

861
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,420
When most of your snγ g to chewy noodles

862
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,460
are already much too bad,

863
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,380
You stink.

864
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,840
Everyone get back

865
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,680
I'll go now.

866
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
Yang never sends messages to the group.

867
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,760
Why do you give him a ride today?

868
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,640
Whatever.

869
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,560
Come here.

870
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,880
How about I take a photo

871
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,000
and send it to you?

872
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,680
No.

873
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
My girlfriend

874
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,000
is the most real one.

875
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,400
