1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
The world is full of people, you are the one who is alone

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate is like a wind, the rain of the wind

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,800
Maybe I will let you be careful

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,600
I will let you be careful

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
I doubt that I will be you

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,000
I am determined to become a man

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,400
For you, I am willing to be a man

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is watching me, I am left and right, what's the point?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
All the days, all the memories are here

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
All the storms, all the life, all the scenery

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
It's for you, for you, I am willing to be a man

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is watching me, I am left and right, what's the point?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Even if there is a person at the end, I will be there

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I am determined to become a man

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
For you, I am willing to be a man

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:36,400
For you, for you, I have loved you before

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,600
So easy

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,400
You need to be nice

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
Let me tell you

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
Welcome to the South Wu University's South Wu High School

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
We are so close

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All of us are going to get our first wish

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
South Wu University

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
I suggest you to give us a toast

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Let's go

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
The university's campus is so famous

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
I am so famous

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
I will tell you first

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I am the one who got the list

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
He got the list again

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
Really?

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
I met you in the high school

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't see him

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Excuse me

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Where are you going?

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Where are you going?

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Take a bath

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Yuting

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Who is going to be with you?

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
I said you are not going to be a good student

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
I said you are not going to be a good student

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
I thought you were a rich man

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
I am rich, you are rich

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,200
I am not rich

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Where are you going?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
Where are you going?

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
Guys, you are so happy

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
Can you stop looking at me?

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
No, I haven't seen my girlfriend yet

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Come, come, come

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Don't look at my girlfriend yet

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Come, Yixing, come, come

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Come, come, come

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Come to me

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,400
Come, come, come

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Come, come, come

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
Come, come, come

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,200
Come, come, come

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
You really don't come back to Han family?

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
I thought you were going to South Wu

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
Or I would go to the North Wu to find you

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Why don't you come back?

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
You are in love

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Wen Yifan

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
If you are in love

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have to tell me, you know?

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't take you to the secret

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Why don't you come back?

70
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
You are there alone

71
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
How miserable it is

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
By the way, last time you asked me to put that hand oil

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I have put it down

74
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
But I forgot

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Which server did you say last time?

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
It's the world's double

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
Then I didn't remember it wrong

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
But why do you start playing games all of a sudden?

79
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
By the way, what's your name?

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
I'll give you a sister name

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wen He's boiling water

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's my name?

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My name is

84
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Xiumeng's ice water

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,400
What's your name in the game?

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll give you a sister name

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
A mysterious force

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
A mysterious force

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A strange force

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
My brother is here

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm afraid I can't buy the ticket back.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you want to stay here tonight?

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean to help you to look for the same room.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm here.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Your room should be in the same room.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It should be in the closest room.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then you take me there.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're so far away.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going back to my room.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And other work.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Anything else?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going back to my room.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You go in yourself.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We just got married.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm afraid you'll be unhappy

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
when you enter your private space.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're quite similar to what you said.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who would have thought that

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you've already changed my whole body?

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What's wrong with your job?

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I spent so much time

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
on the meat you had.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm going to lose half a month.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong?

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What's wrong?

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was hit by a rock.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was serious.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was really serious.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I was hit by a rock.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
By the way,

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
why are you in Beiyu?

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Didn't I tell you that I'm going back tomorrow?

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And did you receive the cake?

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm here for her birthday gift.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Your birthday gift?

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I put your birthday gift at home.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Can you help me find a phone?

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Is everyone in the room?

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This...

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I've received it now.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's here.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let me help you.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm going to wash the apples.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Young Master.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So many years.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm still...

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I only like you.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hello.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your pizza is here.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Here, have a meal.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, have a meal.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You've ordered so many things.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you hungry?

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm not hungry.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll go back to my room after I wash the apples.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't you want to eat?

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Of course.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll eat it.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll eat it.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll eat it.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're eating it?

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Can I eat pizza more?

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll eat it for half an hour.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Can I...

165
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
eat it again?

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll eat it.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think the rain stopped.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yue Lang,

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
when did you buy the ticket?

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Actually,

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I originally wanted to buy the ticket today

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and go back to you for your birthday.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I didn't have the ticket.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you have a ticket to the weekend?

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Do you know

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
if I can't go back today?

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll buy it first.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll go back first.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You don't know?

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll buy it first.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll do the same in the future.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll go back first.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll get up early tomorrow.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll go back first.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good night.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Fang Yan.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Happy birthday.

191
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What is your wish for your birthday?

192
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll tell you.

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why?

194
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you're already a teacher.

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Good night.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Did you see my mom?

198
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She's in a relationship.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She has a partner.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You didn't say

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
that you're not her partner.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Who is she?

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She's not even

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
in a relationship.

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She didn't tell us.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And you didn't tell her.

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She's not her partner.

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
She's been stolen.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's too exaggerated.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Look at the link I sent you.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So she received the cake.

212
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hello?

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hello, Dian Dian.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's the matter?

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Just a little bit.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I just confirmed it.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're on a business trip.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You don't have time.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Besides,

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you said you didn't have any progress.

221
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're not a big deal.

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not.

223
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've already told you.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know.

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm not a big deal.

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm not a big deal.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I just want to say

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that I'm not a big deal.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm not a big deal.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't want to say that.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I just want to say

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that I'm not a big deal.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not a big deal.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I just want to say

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
that I'm not a big deal.

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Do you have any progress?

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're making me worry.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You two are so gentle.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Honestly,

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
how did it get so fast?

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Maybe I didn't hold it right.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh my god, Wen Yifan.

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When will you go back to your manhood?

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Tomorrow morning.

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then we'll meet in the afternoon.

248
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You must tell me clearly.

249
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
OK.

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's all.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Bye.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
Open the door.

253
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
I give you a call,

254
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,480
coming to say goodbye to me.

255
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,720
What should you do about he수 your friend?

256
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,480
He hollars at me for so long and can't reply to a WeChat message.

257
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,200
Then you will be ecosystem untouched.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I haven't been back for so long.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's because...

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's because...

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's because...

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't want to be a friend anymore.

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I want to be your boyfriend.

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Can I?

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How can you do that?

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm right next to my home.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sitting on the bridge.

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Xiaolang.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why are you here?

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I just called you.

272
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I just got off the plane.

273
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I want to surprise you.

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Our company is on the way.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm just coming back to see you.

276
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm a little nervous.

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why are you not surprised?

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, it's just that I have a friend who's here to see me.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why are you here so late?

280
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Dingding.

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, it's a guy.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm a guy.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't think too much.

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know him too.

285
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know him too.

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How about we go together?

287
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Fine.

288
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I just got a very bad news.

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think you'll know it sooner or later.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm with Sang Yan.

291
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But it's a good news.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I wish them well.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you really okay?

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm fine.

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When will you be worried about yourself?

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I...

297
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hello.

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hello.

299
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hello Hello

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hello

301
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is everyone home?

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,240
No

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and you?

304
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
So, did you say Qiao?

305
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,800
He came to me as well.

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,800
Yes.

307
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
I just came back from Hong Kong.

308
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,200
I want to see him.

309
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,000
Actually, I have something important to talk to Qiao today.

310
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
I didn't expect you to be here.

311
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
But it's okay.

312
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm a man.

313
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
I don't have to be so strict.

314
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,800
Zhou Sijiao.

315
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I want you to be my girlfriend.

316
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,000
No.

317
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't be impulsive.

318
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
We can talk.

319
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Talk.

320
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,200
What's this?

321
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
You can't be like this.

322
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Qiao.

323
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Just say it.

324
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,800
No.

325
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
I don't have to care about me.

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,200
I just want to be happy.

327
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,200
Su Hua'an, I'm just...

328
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
What do you mean?

329
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
I think you misunderstood.

330
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Qiao and I are best friends.

331
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
So, Su Hua'an, what do you want to say?

332
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,800
Just say it.

333
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Xia Lang, don't you like Lu Yufan?

334
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,600
I just said it clearly.

335
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
So, you refused to confess to her?

336
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes.

337
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
I did confess to Xia Lang.

338
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,800
She refused.

339
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Did I confess to her?

340
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Can you both not say it?

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,200
Is there any problem in your heart?

342
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Of course not.

343
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,800
How could it be possible?

344
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Then why don't you accept it and let me try?

345
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Can you try it?

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
I just said I wanted to confess.

347
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,400
Sorry.

348
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Sorry.

349
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Su Hua'an.

350
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Su Hua'an.

351
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
Morning.

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,600
Morning.

353
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
We are in the building.

354
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Maybe we can have breakfast and go back.

355
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Okay.

356
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Did you sleep well?

357
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Yes.

358
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's go.

359
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,600
You are going with us?

360
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,400
No.

361
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Hello.

362
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Move out.

363
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,800
Hello.

364
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,800
And me.

365
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,800
Okay.

366
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,000
Wait.

367
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Hello.

368
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Move out.

369
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,400
Hello.

370
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,400
And me.

371
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,000
Okay.

372
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,400
Hold on.

373
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,000
Okay.

374
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,680
Let me check the room.

375
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,520
Good morning, Mr. Qin.

376
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,800
You're done?

377
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,760
Is it you?

378
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,040
Are you here for work or for a trip?

379
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm here to see him.

380
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's go to the room.

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,080
Okay.

382
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,800
Let me check the room first.

383
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,280
Senior Song Yuan.

384
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Although you know you want to see Yifan Jie,

385
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
but he still followed you on a business trip,

386
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,280
I'm afraid it's not suitable for you.

387
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Yifan Jie is a good person.

388
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
She probably won't be angry with you.

389
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,280
But you should at least think about her feelings.

390
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
No wonder you're chasing after someone.

391
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,280
You're only giving others a little pressure.

392
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
I'm just giving you a little pressure.

393
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Let's go through that.

394
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
You've packed everything.

395
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,280
We're now in love.

396
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
This word is love.

397
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Have you heard it?

398
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Who said it?

399
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I did.

400
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Just admit it.

401
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Mr. Qin, let me help you.

402
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
It's okay.

403
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
You're so busy.

404
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Thank you.

405
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
I won't.

406
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Sorry.

407
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I should have opened it, but we didn't get the license.

408
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Let me help you.

409
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
Thank you.

410
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
I'll open it.

411
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Didn't you get a car?

412
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
You're the one who got it.

413
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
But we need to go to the TV station first.

414
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Okay, get in the car.

415
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Qiao Qiao.

416
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
You've been waiting for a long time.

417
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Dian Dian.

418
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
When did you come back?

420
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
I just came back.

421
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,280
What's wrong?

422
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,280
I've been sleeping well last night.

423
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I'm also a part of your family.

424
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,280
I don't know how long I've known you.

425
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Besides, I'm happy to be with Sang Yan.

426
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
What's wrong with you?

427
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Yesterday, I was just pretending to be Su Hao An and Qiao Qiao.

428
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,280
But Qiao Qiao refused me.

429
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Su Hao An is about to fall asleep.

430
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
You're so fake, Su Hao An.

431
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You're so ungrateful.

432
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
She likes you.

433
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Do you like her?

434
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
I don't know.

435
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
But when I couldn't see her,

436
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,280
I thought she was a little bit ridiculous.

437
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
Who knows that I'd see her.

438
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
It's all right.

439
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Anyway, I've come to see her.

440
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Maybe it's fate.

441
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Forget it.

442
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,280
She's not a dancer on earth.

443
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
She's a set of sets when I'm in a relationship.

444
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Is that possible?

445
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
All right.

446
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,280
Although she looks a bit unadulterated,

447
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I think she's very professional.

448
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,280
You're different from her.

449
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
She looks very strong,

450
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
but she's very considerate.

451
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,280
She's quite stable.

452
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Let me try.

453
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Forget it.

454
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
No, let's eat.

455
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
We're finally home.

456
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Hey.

457
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Is something the matter?

458
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Wait a minute.

459
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
Wait a minute.

460
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
The clothes.

461
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Why did you choose this color?

462
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Because I don't think it's suitable

463
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
for you to wear this color.

464
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
All right.

465
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I'll take it off.

466
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Don't you like it?

467
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Let me give you another gift.

468
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
I'll give you another gift.

469
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I can't accept it.

470
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
I received many gifts this year.

471
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,280
I'm so satisfied with the result.

472
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
This is the second one.

473
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
What's the first one?

474
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
What's the last one?

475
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
What is it?

476
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
What do you think?

477
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I guess.

478
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
I'll give you another gift.

479
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I'll give you another gift.

480
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
All right.

481
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Okay.

482
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
As long as you like it.

483
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
What's wrong?

484
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,200
I vomited.

485
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,560
I'm home.

486
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
It's really not five minutes.

487
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,880
It's just that the two of us

488
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,240
are free.

489
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,560
The atmosphere is a bit heavy.

490
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
I have to think of a way

491
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,160
to stop her from touching my face.

492
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,400
My body依次变得不太静定

493
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,080
Ah!

494
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,440
My back hurts!

495
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,760
Where's the sausage?

496
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,000
It's not that far.

497
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,880
Come here.

498
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,140
Here.

499
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Come when they give me some help.

500
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,680
I will pay attention to it.

501
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,880
You can pay attention to your strength.

502
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
You can still remember the performance.

503
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
I didn't care about it after the festival.

504
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,680
I thought it was not good.

505
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,280
You always get hurt when you work.

506
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't you feel hurt now?

507
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
No.

508
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Okay. Please take a rest.

509
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Okay.

510
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Come to me tomorrow after you like to go.

511
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Okay.

512
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Is it too fast?

513
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
What are you thinking about? Help you apply medicine.

514
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
I will be back.

515
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Okay.

516
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Let's go.

517
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Sister Yifan.

518
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,280
I'm sorry, I have to delay for a few minutes.

519
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I will wait for you in the car.

520
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Okay.

521
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
What's wrong?

522
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I don't understand why I am with Sang Yan.

523
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
I really can't find any advantages.

524
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Why do I have to make myself feel wrong?

525
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
No.

526
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
Did he confess to you?

527
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Yes.

528
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
He always confesses to me.

529
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
He is such a person?

530
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Yes.

531
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,280
I don't care.

532
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
If he dares to hurt you,

533
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
I can help you to repay him.

534
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Okay. Thank you.

535
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Actually, I already like him when I was in high school.

536
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I just didn't admit it.

537
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Now that I can be with him,

538
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
I feel very happy.

539
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Okay.

540
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,280
You will meet the person who knows how to cherish you.

541
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
I will go to work.

542
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Here you are.

543
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
The fish is in the water.

544
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
What are you doing?

545
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Here you are.

546
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Have a taste.

547
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
I have finished the meal.

548
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Come on, let's work.

549
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
You are boring. Come with me.

550
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
I am coming.

551
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Where are you going?

552
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Go home.

553
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Let's go.

554
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Do they know that you are dating with Mr. Sang?

555
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
I don't know.

556
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
I have never asked.

557
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Since you are sure that Guan Si Ling is a little girl,

558
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
you should ask.

559
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
No.

560
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
If you want to be a little girl,

561
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
why do you have to be so nervous?

562
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
What are you nervous about?

563
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Please.

564
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
This is Sang Yan's first time

565
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,280
to be in front of me as a man.

566
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,280
I don't know how to face him.

567
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Look at him.

568
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Just tell me.

569
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Okay.

570
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
In fact,

571
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
the transformation of the relationship after so many years

572
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,280
also made me a little confused.

573
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Here you are.

574
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Guan Si Ling cooked the dishes for you today.

575
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
He made the fish with water.

576
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Yang Fei Yang.

577
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
What are you doing here?

578
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Hello.

579
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Welcome.

580
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Come sit down.

581
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Hurry up.

582
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
Come.

583
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Sit here.

584
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Come with this.

585
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
This is...

586
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Thank you.

587
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
What are you doing?

588
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
What does this mean?

589
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
What do you mean?

590
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
You are a girl, right?

591
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Why do you still have to be with other girls?

592
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Don't ask.

593
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,280
It seems that I haven't told them yet.

594
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Why are you looking at me?

595
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
This is the first time I see you wearing a bright color.

596
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
I said how to look a little weird today.

597
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
You just realized it so clearly.

598
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
What do you mean by this?

599
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
You are so jealous.

600
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
You are pretending to be a man here.

601
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Right, Yifan?

602
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Right?

603
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
Are you okay?

604
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,280
I think you are a little bit younger.

605
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
You don't have any aesthetic.

606
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Your sister-in-law is a man.

607
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
She just likes this kind of thing.

608
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Sister-in-law?

609
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Oh my god.

610
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
You are too fast like your old man.

611
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
It's only a few days.

612
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
She is going to call me sister-in-law.

613
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Let me do it.

614
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm not going to do it.

615
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Thank you.

616
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Come on.

617
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Try it.

618
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
It's not good.

619
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
Right?

620
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Mr. Zhang,

621
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
we have been sitting here for a whole afternoon.

622
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
You haven't had a drink for a long time.

623
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
And Yifan is going to be a strong man.

624
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Me too.

625
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Drive.

626
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
You are too weird.

627
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
But I still have to remind you

628
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
to be so single.

629
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Don't be angry.

630
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
Don't worry.

631
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
I can't learn it.

632
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Yan,

633
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
I also want to mention two things.

634
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Be polite.

635
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Don't run away.

636
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
The only thing in the world

637
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
can endure you.

638
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
You are a dog-nose.

639
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Is there any problem?

640
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
I can't learn it at all.

641
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
Do you want to be a backer

642
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
or...

643
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
She likes me.

644
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
When will you show us

645
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
your face

646
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
to our team?

647
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Right?

648
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
It's been a few days.

649
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Or you don't have any confidence

650
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
to show your face to our team

651
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
to see me?

652
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Don't be a dream.

653
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Let's go.

654
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
Let's go.

655
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
I'm going to be a fan.

656
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,280
I'm going to be a fan.

657
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Come on, Yifan.

658
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
You want to go too?

659
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,280
He wants to go too.

660
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
He doesn't want to go back.

661
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
I don't want to go.

662
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
You are so sad.

663
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
You have a team.

664
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
You still have

665
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
to be a pair

666
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
with your roommate.

667
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
You are a good match.

668
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Can you stand

669
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
your sister-in-law?

670
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
I agree.

671
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
We are a good match.

672
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
You are so smart.

673
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Really.

674
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Qiaoqiao.

675
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
I'm going to be a fan.

676
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
You are not going to go?

677
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
We are going to be a fan.

678
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Let's go.

679
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Right.

680
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Let's go.

681
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
I'm a new friend.

682
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Okay.

683
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Come on.

684
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I didn't tell them

685
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
that I was the one who was the best.

686
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I didn't expect

687
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
they couldn't tell me.

688
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
Let's find a proper

689
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
partner

690
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
and tell them.

691
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
What should we do?

692
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Are you excited?

693
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
I'm just curious.

694
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
Is this a good idea?

695
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Yes.

696
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
The color,

697
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
the fabric,

698
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
the mouth,

699
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
the hair,

700
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
are all done.

701
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I wanted to say

702
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
that you wear this dress

703
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
and the color

704
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
will be more gentle.

705
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,280
I didn't expect it.

706
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
You didn't expect it?

707
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
I didn't expect that

708
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
you would turn.

709
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
You will turn even if you don't wear the dress.

710
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
What?

711
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
You fell down

712
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
with your partner?

713
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
You can say whatever you want.

714
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Let's have a meal.

715
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Didn't you eat?

716
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
No, I was waiting for you.

717
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Did you eat?

718
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Yes.

719
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Didn't we take a photo

720
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
and show it to you?

721
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
What does this mean?

722
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
You want to see me?

723
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
You want to see me?

724
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Sit down and chat.

725
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Have some water.

726
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
I know you are busy.

727
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
I'm sorry.

728
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
But I really don't know

729
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
who to talk to.

730
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
I was really upset before.

731
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
I've never felt like this.

732
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
I just want to know more about him.

733
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Of course, I want to ask him.

734
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
But I feel

735
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
if he finds out,

736
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
he will be angry

737
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
and want to talk to him.

738
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
So I asked you.

739
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Look.

740
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
He doesn't look

741
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
that happy.

742
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
He doesn't say anything.

743
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
He just means to cooperate with me.

744
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
In the second year of high school,

745
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
after the second year of the class,

746
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,280
he was always unhappy.

747
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
When I came back

748
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
to him in the first year of Han family,

749
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
he didn't say anything

750
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
and agreed to me.

751
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
He was very upset with him.

752
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I thought you would knock on a big plate.

753
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I didn't expect you to have a egg.

754
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
What's wrong with you?

755
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I suddenly feel that

756
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
we have become so far away.

757
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
So far away.

758
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
What kind of men are so hard to deal with?

759
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
No one cares about them.

760
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
What's wrong with you?

761
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Is there something wrong with you recently?

762
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Do I have to think about you

763
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
when I have something to do?

764
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Do I have to care

765
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
about each other

766
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
when I have something to do with my friends?

767
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
We have been

768
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
busy these past ten years.

769
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Okay.

770
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
We are busy.

771
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
You don't have to

772
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
leave me alone.

773
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
You have to come back

774
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
so soon

775
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
and come back to see me.

776
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Xiao Xiao.

777
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,280
Do you know why I bought the cake?

779
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Because you are going back soon.

780
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Your birthday is on the 14th of March.

781
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
I was afraid that

782
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
no one would give you

783
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
birthday gifts

784
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
in his box.

785
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
I remember you and Dianian

786
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
every year.

787
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Do you remember?

788
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
He can always remember

789
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
what we like.

790
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
What is his birthday?

791
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
It seems that

792
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
we are used to his existence.

793
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Although he is not

794
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
the most loyal person in the past,

795
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
but the most loyal person

796
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
needs him very much.

797
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Can you

798
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
talk a little more?

799
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Would you like to eat something first?

800
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Don't eat.

801
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I just feel

802
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
that I don't know anything.

803
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
So,

804
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,280
I want to know more about him.

805
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
I thought of something else.

806
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
I want to know more about him.

807
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
I thought of something else.

808
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Actually,

809
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
he is not happy

810
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
at that time.

811
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
He is not happy at all.

812
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
And at that time,

813
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
his parents are divorced.

814
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Which flavor do you want to eat?

815
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
I don't want to say

816
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I want to order other dishes.

817
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
You choose.

818
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I will treat you to a meal anyway.

819
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Then,

820
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
this is not bad.

821
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Are you sure?

822
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
What do you want to eat?

823
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Do you have a lot of customers?

824
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I don't have any.

825
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
What are you looking at?

826
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
A light steak.

827
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Eat it.

828
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Do you like it?

829
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
I ordered

830
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
a bit more heavy.

831
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
You like it.

832
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
You like it light.

833
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I try to imagine

834
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
the taste that you usually like.

835
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
I really like this one.

836
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
What are you looking at?

837
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
I am listening to you.

838
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,280
Then,

839
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
let's eat.

840
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
I will go to the restaurant after eating.

841
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Thank you.

842
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
You two take care of these.

843
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
Thank you.

844
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
What are you reading?

845
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
Mine.

846
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
I'm not sure if I can do it.

847
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
I'm not sure.

848
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
I'm not sure.

849
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I'm not sure.

850
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,280
I'm not sure.

851
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,280
I'm not sure.

852
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,280
I'm not sure.

853
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm not sure.

854
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm not sure.

855
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I'm not sure.

856
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm not sure.

857
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
I'm not sure.

858
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm not sure.

859
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
I'm not sure.

860
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
I'm not sure.

861
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
I'm not sure.

862
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
I'm not sure.

863
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I'm not sure.

864
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I'm not sure.

865
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
I'm not sure.

866
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
I'm not sure.

867
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
I'm not sure.

868
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
I'm not sure.

869
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
I'm not sure.

870
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
I'm not sure.

871
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
I'm not sure.

872
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,280
I'm not sure.

873
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
I'm not sure.

874
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
I guess.

875
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
I'm not sure what to do.

876
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,180
I'm waiting for you.

877
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,260
I'm not sure.

878
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,340
I'm not sure.

879
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,860
I'm not sure.

880
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,960
I'm not sure.

881
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,740
I'm not sure.

882
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,760
I'm not sure.

883
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm not sure.

884
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,980
I'm not sure.

885
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,980
I don't want to do everything.

886
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,960
I don't like to go on因为 I don't want to go on to the world.

887
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
I'm not sure.

888
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm not sure.

889
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,360
I will follow this journey

890
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
I won't give up

891
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:36,360
I will be here with you

892
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,360
It's you in the wind

893
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,360
That doesn't want me to come

894
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,360
It's you standing by me

895
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Don't be afraid of me and her

896
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,360
This journey is not a question

897
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,360
The sky is full of clouds

898
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,360
But I have you in my mind

899
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,360
How can I give up?

900
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,360
I won't give up

901
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
You give me the courage

902
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,360
And I will be in the future

903
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,360
It's you in my mind

904
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,360
I will be here with you

905
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,360
Even if it's a wish

906
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,360
I won't be alone

907
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,360
Until you exist

908
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,360
I can only be the darkness before my eyes
