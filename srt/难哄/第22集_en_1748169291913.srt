1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
The world is full of people, you are the one who is in the bed

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain is like the wind, the rain is like the wind

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,600
Maybe when you are awake, you will be the one

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
I am sure that I will be you

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,400
I am determined to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is watching me, I am left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I will always hold your hand and remember all the memories

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
All the storms and storms are the light of my life

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
It's for you, for you to be the one

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is watching me, I am left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Even if there is a rain or a rain in the end

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I am not afraid to be the one

13
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I am determined to become a man for you, for you to be the one

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,200
I am determined to be the one

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,000
I have loved you for a lifetime

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Yifan, what are you doing over there? You are killing me

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
What's wrong with you?

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Yifan, you have an exam tomorrow. What are you doing?

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Yifan, why don't you move?

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Yifan, I am talking to you

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,000
Yifan, what are you doing over there? You are killing me

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
What's wrong with you?

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
What's wrong?

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Yifan, you have an exam tomorrow. What are you doing?

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Yifan, why don't you move?

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Yifan, I am talking to you

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,800
Yifan

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yifan, I am scared

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Wait a minute

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Wait a minute

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Wait a minute, I am going to the hospital after the exam

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Let's relax together

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
If you don't go, I will be alone

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I beg you, go

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
What? I am going to the hospital

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I beg you, go

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
What? I am going to the hospital

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
I didn't sleep well

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I am going to the exam tomorrow. I am really tired

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Hurry up, the men are pushing

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Do you want me to ask you?

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Go, go

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Yifan, you are not good at thinking about it

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Why don't you come with us?

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes, come with us

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Otherwise, you won't be good at it

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Go

48
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Really?

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
You

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Yifan

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Yifan, do you usually like to watch movies?

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,800
There is a new love movie

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I want to watch a movie with you

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Why do you like to watch a movie?

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's go together

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Who wants to go with you?

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Go with your friends

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Why do you like to watch a movie?

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Yifan, have you thought about where to study?

60
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Now you have made a decision

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
You have to do something good

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
You can't find it

63
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Yes

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
If you want to go to the newspaper, I can arrange it

65
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Really?

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes

67
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Our radio station is good

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I know the host of the radio station

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Yifan, if you dare to go in

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
I can introduce you

71
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I want to go too

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Who wants to watch the newspaper?

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
It's on the radio

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Introduce yourself

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I have to call my family

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I won't eat it

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
You eat it

78
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I will send you

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I will call you

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Take care

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Take care

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
Take care

83
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Bye

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Take care

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Hurry up

86
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
This is delicious

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Eat more

88
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
You are so happy for Yifan

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
He is our Xihua

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I haven't seen you on the show for a long time

91
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Is everything okay?

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
There are more guests recently

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
By the way

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Do you know how to pass the four of the Nine-Turn Sky Street?

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
I know

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I'll teach you

97
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Pass smoothly

98
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Thank you

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Congratulations

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
I thought the dinner was a nightmare

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
But I'm glad to have you

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm much better now

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Thank you

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
See you

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Sleep early

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Good night

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Why is Sanya not sleeping?

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Sanya

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Sanya

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Sanya

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Sanya

112
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Sanya

113
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Sanya

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Sanya

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Sanya

116
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Sanya

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Sanya

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Sanya

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Sanya

120
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Sanya

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Sanya

122
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Sanya

123
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Sanya

124
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Sanya

125
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Sanya

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Sanya

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,800
You must have received the gift of Yucheng

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
I want to cheer up like you

129
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Good

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
I want to collect the maps of me

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll give you the travel rules

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Great

133
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Thank you

134
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
You can go with me

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
You'll be bored by yourself

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Grandma

137
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Do you feel bored by yourself?

138
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
It's hard to say

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
But I think a life is a lonely life

140
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm free and lonely

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
But I'm my own king

142
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I've learned a lot this trip

143
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I've learned a lot

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I've learned to guard the house

145
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
But to be honest

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
When you're not at home

147
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
I often have nightmares and surprise

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm worried about you

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
You might have something to do

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Sometimes

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I don't reply to your messages

152
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You're right

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm driving

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
How can I watch your phone?

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
I know

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
So I'm used to it

157
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Besides

158
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
When you're not at home

159
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I often think about

160
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
the happy things we've done

161
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
And

162
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Grandpa

163
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Grandpa

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
He's still studying

165
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
And he's still remembering

166
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
the important things

167
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
How can he forget them?

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Right

169
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I've learned a lot this trip

170
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I've realized

171
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,800
that you're important to me

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I've never changed

173
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Grandma

174
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Which one impressed you the most?

175
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I'll think about it

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I went to the place

177
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
where your father and mother

178
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
and your brother were born

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
It was very empty

180
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
and beautiful

181
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
From the day to night

182
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I stayed there for a whole day

183
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Did you see it?

184
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
I didn't expect

185
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
to live here for so many years

186
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
It's even more beautiful here

187
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I'll take you there

188
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
if I have a chance

189
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I'll take you there

190
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Okay?

191
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
You must be very sad

192
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
to be back there

193
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I was thinking

194
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
that over the past ten years

195
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
our family

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
never mentioned that car accident

197
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
I'll go to the water pipe

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
No need

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Come on

200
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Sit down

201
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
We should talk about it

202
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
After that

203
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
we never talked about it

204
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
But in fact

205
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
we'll never forget

206
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
this accident

207
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
But we're still hiding

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I was thinking

209
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm glad

210
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I have you

211
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
We should live well

212
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
and forget

213
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
those sad things

214
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Okay?

215
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Okay?

216
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Hello?

217
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm ready

218
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I'm coming

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I'll have a drink

220
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
or I'll ask someone to pick me up

221
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
No need

222
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I'll be fine

223
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Be careful on the way

224
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Bye

225
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
See you later

226
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Sister Yifan

227
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
What's up?

228
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
You look so pretty today

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm going to attend

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
a friend's wedding

231
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I have something to tell you

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
I'll go with you

233
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Since you two are together

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I want to explain

235
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
something to you

236
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I want to know

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Actually

238
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
I said

239
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
what you said

240
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
in the graduation ceremony

241
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I was the one who said it

242
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Someone asked

243
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
in the graduation ceremony

244
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
if you can't get it

245
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
you're the best

246
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
so you're sad

247
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
He said

248
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
you think I'm

249
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
such a long-time person

250
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
But that day

251
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
there was a student

252
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
who said

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
he was a burden

254
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
for others

255
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
But I can't remember

256
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
For a while

257
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I didn't know

258
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
how to face you

259
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
But now

260
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I want to open up

261
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Why did you say that?

262
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Because I'm afraid

263
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
it will affect

264
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
the relationship between you two

265
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I won't

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
That's good

267
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
I wish you

268
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
work

269
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
life

270
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
or love

271
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
won't be stressed

272
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Actually I think

273
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
sometimes life is good

274
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
when you get it

275
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
I wish you happiness

276
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Thank you

277
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
You too

278
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Thank you

279
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Eat well

280
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Eat slowly

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Friends

282
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Introduce to you

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
our female lead today

284
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
My wife Shi Wen

285
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Hello

286
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
This is my colleague

287
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
who is my mom

288
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
and this is my college friend

289
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
We are all very good friends

290
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Look at your eyes

291
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Don't say I'm in the field

292
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Shen Yuwen

293
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Red bird

294
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Without her

295
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
we won't be together

296
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Thank you

297
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Later, drink a toast

298
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Later, drink a toast

299
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Thank you

300
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Later, drink a toast

301
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Okay

302
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Sorry

303
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Sorry

304
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I missed something

305
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
You came just right

306
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Drink a few more

307
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Go to our house

308
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Where have you been for so long?

309
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
You are late for the important day

310
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
You are late for the meeting

311
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Su Hao

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
You have been very kind to me recently

313
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Because you are handsome

314
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Is this a gift from everyone?

315
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Didn't you see me last time?

316
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Pretty handsome

317
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Nothing has changed

318
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Nothing has changed

319
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Handsome?

320
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
This is a normal dress

321
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
It looks a little dull

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Yu Zhong

323
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Is he handsome?

324
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Let me see

325
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
You really fall in love with Duan Jiaxu, right?

326
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Done

327
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Handsome?

328
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Let's move

329
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm not that handsome

330
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
What's wrong with you?

331
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I can see it

332
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
No wonder you look at me like this

333
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Thank you

334
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I'll take a picture

335
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Don't drink

336
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Chen Jiuwan

337
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Chen Jiuwan

338
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I heard it

339
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Handsome?

340
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Handsome

341
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
I mean

342
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Who is handsome?

343
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Of course, Jiaxu is handsome

344
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Then you don't need to say

345
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Are you full?

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm full

347
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Jiaxu

348
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
You didn't drink

349
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
I didn't bring it back

350
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I just came

351
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
You don't need to say it

352
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I think it through

353
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
There is a most fair way

354
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I count to three

355
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
How about the one who thinks I'm the most handsome

356
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Okay, you help me

357
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
One, two, three

358
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm here

359
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Tian Tian

360
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Do you still hide your face?

361
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I've been hiding it for so long

362
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Or did you blow it yourself?

363
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I don't know

364
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Old Tang, can you smell it?

365
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes, yes

366
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Can you smell it?

367
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Look, I'm calling

368
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'm going to get in the car

369
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Wait a minute, I'll go in and find you

370
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Wait a minute

371
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm looking forward to it

372
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Come on, I'm not here yet

373
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
What are you looking at?

374
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Are you crazy?

375
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Hurry up

376
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
I'll send you back

377
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Okay

378
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Let's go, master

379
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Stop, thank you

380
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Why are you here?

381
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm waiting for you

382
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Have you drunk?

383
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I have to be in charge of the objects

384
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Then I have to be in charge of everything?

385
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
Of course

386
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
But your object must be solved

387
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
How much did you drink?

388
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I don't know

389
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Why did you drink so much?

390
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I don't know

391
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I don't know

392
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I don't know

393
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
How come?

394
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I don't know

395
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Master, this is Wei Yifan

396
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
What's wrong?

397
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
He is the crazy girl you said

398
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
You said it wrongly

399
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Where is Du Xiaoxu?

400
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Du Xiaoxu didn't drink

401
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I sent him back three times

402
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
He said it so stupidly

403
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
He can't be missed

404
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Wei Yifan, say something

405
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
You hit his face

406
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
You see, he is so stupid

407
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
He is so stupid

408
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
He is so stupid

409
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
He is so stupid

410
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
He is so stupid

411
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
He is so stupid

412
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
He is so stupid

413
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
He is so stupid

414
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Look at his face

415
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
He is so stupid

416
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I am not afraid

417
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I am chasing

418
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Song Hao

419
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
So

420
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
The girl you said

421
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Sang Yan

422
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
can't chase after

423
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Yes

424
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I am so stupid

425
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I thought it was weird

426
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
when Sang Yan asked me

427
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Who's the one who's the best for me and Duan Jiaxu?

428
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
You take one vote.

429
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
No need.

430
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I never get to see someone like that.

431
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm sincere.

432
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Really?

433
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
How about I don't have to chase you so crazily?

434
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Thank you, brother.

435
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Thank you, brother.

436
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Why do I have to take a picture at once?

437
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
It's a day and night.

438
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
It's over, okay?

439
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Congratulations.

440
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm sorry.

441
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I understand.

442
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm sorry.

443
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,800
The Long Ballad

444
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Qian Fei Fei.

445
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
What?

446
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
She's the first one we've ever married.

447
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Yeah, we've been married for many years.

448
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Do you remember?

449
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
When we graduated from the class,

450
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
she was drunk and embarrassed.

451
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
So,

452
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
she complained about her own background for so long.

453
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Do you remember?

454
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Wan Lin,

455
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I've been your background for four years.

456
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Brother.

457
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Wan Lin.

458
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
You're drunk again.

459
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
It's not Wan Lin's fault.

460
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Come here.

461
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Come here.

462
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Wan Lin, this is Wan Lin.

463
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
This is not Wan Lin.

464
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Wan Lin.

465
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Wan Lin is not here.

466
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Wan Lin,

467
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
last four years,

468
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I've really been your background.

469
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I've been drinking like this every time.

470
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm sorry.

471
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
No.

472
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Don't move.

473
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Don't move.

474
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Shut your mouth.

475
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Shut your mouth.

476
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Don't talk.

477
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Go to sleep.

479
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Go to sleep.

480
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I'm sorry.

481
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Wan Lin, I'm sorry.

482
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm sorry.

483
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
You two, be a little more diligent, okay?

484
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Qian Fei.

485
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Qian Fei.

486
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Come here.

487
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Come here.

488
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Didn't you say it's not Sang Yan?

489
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Don't talk nonsense.

490
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Sang Yan was drunk anyway.

491
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
He was sitting there.

492
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I don't know if he treated me like a water or something.

493
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
He was always sitting there.

494
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Wei Yifan.

495
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Come, I'll drink with you.

496
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
I hope you can be with Sang Yan.

497
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Let's drink together.

498
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
No.

499
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I don't drink.

500
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Wei Yifan, you have to drink.

501
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Let's drink together.

502
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Let's drink together.

503
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Let's drink together.

504
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Let's drink together.

505
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Let's drink together.

506
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Let's drink together.

507
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Where are you going?

508
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm going home.

509
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Why aren't you coming?

510
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Are you going to be a boss at the office?

511
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
You've been drinking so much.

512
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm afraid I'll be late.

513
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
I'm so scared.

514
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,240
It's so noisy.

515
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,560
This is good.

516
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,840
This is good.

517
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
My baby.

518
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,520
Let's go.

519
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,480
Are you done?

520
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,960
Two minutes.

521
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
Two minutes. I'll be right there.

522
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,040
Quick!

523
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,280
Lu Qing.

524
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,040
The palm is good.

525
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:03,840
Lili!

526
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,680
My continues...

527
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,640
Lili,

528
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,600
your mother's bracelet is okay.

529
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,320
What?

530
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,720
What are you saying?

531
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,720
Let me get it for you!

532
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Then why do you need it?

533
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I need it.

534
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
You need it?

535
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I... I'm not smiling at other girls.

536
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
Don't drink too much.

537
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I'll pour you some water.

538
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Who am I smiling at today?

539
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Not today.

540
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
When?

541
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Not today.

542
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Tell me.

543
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm not saying.

544
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm not saying.

545
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
You...

546
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
When you were working at this place,

547
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
you were smiling at all girls.

548
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
You even added a WeChat.

549
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Add a WeChat?

550
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Master.

551
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Did you see it yourself?

552
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Did you add it?

553
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Get in the car.

554
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
WeChat?

555
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Okay.

556
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Get off.

557
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm already in the water.

558
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
You can't do this to me.

559
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay.

560
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Master, I'm...

561
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I'm crying.

562
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Why is it so hard to say?

563
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm not crying.

564
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Can you help me cry?

565
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
Not suitable.

566
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Okay.

567
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Okay.

568
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
Will they laugh at you like a little girl?

569
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
They are so naughty.

570
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Is it nice?

571
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
It is.

572
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Can you take me home tomorrow?

573
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
What?

574
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
You drink like this.

575
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I'll get up tomorrow.

576
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
You're resting.

577
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
So you're torturing me, right?

578
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
Why are you torturing me?

579
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm already working hard

580
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
to earn money and raise you.

581
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
You're now going to be a boss

582
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
and do whatever you want to do to me.

583
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
You're going to be a boss.

584
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
You're a man of your word.

585
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
I have a point.

586
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Can you make some money?

587
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Of course I can.

588
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Why are you here?

589
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Didn't you order me to come?

590
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Is there a problem?

591
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
Yes.

592
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Maybe I want to see you.

593
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I really hate the opposite side of the industry.

594
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
They're concerned.

595
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
You're drinking so much for this?

596
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm happy.

597
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
But I'm also a little envious.

598
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
It's good that others are happy.

599
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
What are you envious of?

600
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,800
They can announce their relationship with the whole world.

601
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It's even more touching than the question.

602
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
It's like those old girlfriends of mine.

603
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
My friends don't even let me go.

604
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I want us to be together.

605
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
What are you doing?

606
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
What's up?

607
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
What's up?

608
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
What's up?

609
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
Your head.

610
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Your head.

611
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Thank you, master.

612
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
You...

613
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Want to vomit?

614
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Are you okay?

615
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
I'm fine.

616
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
You can't eat on the color.

617
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I know.

618
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,800
You really know?

619
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I know.

620
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Come on.

621
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
This is the most unregulated.

622
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
No one wants you to eat on the color.

623
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Who?

624
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I just want to drink a bowl of porridge

625
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
after the meeting.

626
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Do you know that the press conference

627
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
has a high number of reporters?

628
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I didn't expect to be able to enter the meeting.

629
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I just wanted to try it.

630
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Then I voted for the meeting.

631
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Then what?

632
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
I only knew for a few months.

633
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Our department said I was because of

634
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
the relationship with the director.

635
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I could go in because I wanted to.

636
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,800
But I don't care about what they say.

637
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I can't control my mouth on someone else's side.

638
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
But I didn't expect that director

639
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
was really young.

640
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
He said that my appearance

641
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,800
is more relaxed than the reporters.

642
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I don't know what I said in the piano.

643
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
I don't know.

644
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Let's not go there anymore.

645
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I don't like being so much.

646
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
You heard them.

647
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
They are not close.

648
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I can't control it.

649
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
You can't control it?

650
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
No.

651
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
I saw that I was in front of you.

652
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
What did you see?

653
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I dreamed that you

654
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,800
came to my wedding with your wife.

655
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
What did you see?

656
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I...

657
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Sit down.

658
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You are happy and you are smiling at me.

659
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,800
We will go to the clothing department.

660
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Xiao Guan.

661
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
I'm sorry, San Yan.

662
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
What do you want?

663
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I'm too heavy.

664
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
What are you heavy for?

665
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
Sorry, I was too heavy to carry myself.

666
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
I feel pain.

667
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,800
I feel pain in my neck.

668
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Eat more in the future.

669
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I want to lie down and lie down.

670
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Okay.

671
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
Don't be sad.

672
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm sorry, San Yan.

673
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I was too heavy to talk.

674
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Do you know?

675
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I don't like Yi He.

676
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
I don't like Bai Yu either.

677
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I don't like Bai Yu either.

678
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I don't like Bai Yu either.

679
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
I don't like Bai Yu either.

680
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I don't like Bai Yu either.

681
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
I want a city to be my heart.

682
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
These cities don't like me either.

683
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
At least I have my father's tomb.

684
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,800
At least I have someone I want to see,

685
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
but I don't dare to see.

686
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
It's you.

687
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Sang Yan was drunk at that time.

688
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,800
He sat there with a cup of wine.

689
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
He was always in the middle of the street.

690
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
What?

691
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
He said,

692
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
am I your back?

693
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Am I your back?

694
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm fine with being your back.

695
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
That moment,

696
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
that word of Sang Yan,

697
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,800
seemed to have been re-enacted.

698
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,800
One time after another,

699
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
I seemed to be at the scene,

700
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,800
and saw that drunk Sang Yan.

701
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Get up.

702
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Don't move. I'm sleeping.

703
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Don't move.

704
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Don't move.

705
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
I'm just scolding you.

706
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Fine.

707
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
I'll listen to your mom.

708
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Okay.

709
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
I'll listen to your mom.

710
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Okay.

711
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I'll listen to your mom.

712
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Okay.

713
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
I'll listen to your mom.

714
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Sang Yan is still drunk.

715
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Don't worry.

716
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
You've already had a big tongue.

717
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
You don't even have a sore throat.

718
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Get up.

719
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Okay.

720
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Oh, are you waking up?

721
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Did you know?

722
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
I'll drink an orange juice today.

723
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
There are still people who use it.

724
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
What's the result?

725
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
thee result?

726
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,840
The one who got the result

727
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,640
still got my temper.

728
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,760
Then don't mind him.

729
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,960
Drink it.

730
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,840
Drink it slowly.

731
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
I want you to drink it.

732
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,080
You've been drinking for a long time.

733
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,200
You still remember me?

734
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
You should drink it.

735
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
The older brother is coming.

736
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,480
Take your time.

737
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,200
Let me go.

738
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,960
You can't.

739
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,680
Take a rest.

740
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,240
Get up.

741
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,760
Go to take a shower.

742
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,040
I don't want to move.

743
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,680
Can you wash me first?

744
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,520
I can't.

745
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,160
Then...

746
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,080
You don't want to move in the future.

747
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,520
I can also help you to die.

748
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,320
Help me wash you.

749
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,040
Stop.

750
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,760
I don't need you to help me wash me.

751
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,680
You go back to sleep first, okay?

752
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,480
I want to eat.

753
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,040
I'm a little angry, right?

754
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm a double-dead.

755
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,280
I think you'll get up tomorrow.

756
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,920
Okay.

757
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,360
Then I won't.

758
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,080
I'll come back to sleep with you.

759
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,160
I'll sing.

760
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
I won't sleep with you.

761
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Don't want to sleep with me.

762
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,080
I can hug you in my bed.

763
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,960
Don't move.

764
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,200
Can I stay here?

765
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,680
I'll hold you.

766
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
How can I sleep?

767
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,080
Why can't I?

768
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm a boy.

769
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,760
What about you?

770
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,440
I'll sleep on my own.

771
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
I really can't sleep at night.

772
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
Go back to sleep with me.

773
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,740
Fight guilty.

774
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,940
I will.

775
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,900
I will.

776
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,940
What's the chance?

777
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,860
What's the chance?

778
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,180
I guessed it.

779
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,340
The chance is for those who are prepared.

780
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
So easy.

781
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,140
It's interesting.

782
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,420
Good night.

783
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,460
Good night.

784
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,260
Zhang Yan.

785
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,220
You...

786
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,460
I...

787
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,660
Sun Yang...

788
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,740
you are in trouble.

789
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,220
We should help you out.

790
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,080
No VVIP ten million or 300 million dollars.

791
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,340
Your dreams?

792
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,520
Shall I go back and look at you?

793
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,100
What do you feature in your system?

794
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,180
Powerful lights.

795
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,500
Like a driving detected.

796
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,220
Yes.

797
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,140
Why are you here?

798
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
You don't want to hold me, do you?

799
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,940
I'm not brave enough.

800
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,220
Well, I...

801
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
I...

802
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,820
You wrote it yourself?

803
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:00,700
Yes.

804
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,380
Well,

805
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,380
I'm not brave enough.

806
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,500
The weird movements are normal.

807
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,740
Normal.

808
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,820
Normal.

809
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,980
I want to help you to take a shower.

810
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,020
And help me take a shower.

811
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,740
I'm sorry for the joke.

812
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,620
I'll help you to get a chance.

813
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,580
You didn't help me, did you?

814
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,700
Protect yourself.

815
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,300
The chance is for you to leave it to me.

816
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,820
The chance is for you to leave it to Mr. Sa.

817
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,800
