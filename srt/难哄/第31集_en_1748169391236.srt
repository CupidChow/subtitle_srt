1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll remember everything in this life.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All the storms and storms are for the sake of our life.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's for you. It's for you.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How can I be free from the feelings?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The world is against me.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
How can I be free from the feelings?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll keep my word even if there's no one to help me.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've loved you for a long time.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Excuse me.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Be careful.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Bye.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're almost there.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is the first time I've seen him.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
How can I let him notice me?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go with you.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm not satisfied yet.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll get you some water.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wait here.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was my first time seeing him.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your dirt problem.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How can I get away with it?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Senior, please tell me how to get to the 17th class.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm sorry, I'm a new student.

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Turn left to the stairs, please.

38
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,200
Then?

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,700
Then?

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,800
Then you can see the number on the door.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Do you often have a senior who can tell you one by one?

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Senior.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you, Senior.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,400
You are있ing convenient?

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
No, it's okay.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
That's him.

47
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,600
That's your house?

48
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,880
I've never seen you thisス такой认真化妝.

49
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,140
Appreciate it.

50
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,300
It's already beautiful.

52
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,460
Really.

53
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,780
Do you want to see my parents

54
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,980
and prepare the play?

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,500
I can't say that.

56
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,020
Okay.

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,180
Don't be nervous.

58
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,500
I'll help you.

59
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,540
Let me see what it says.

60
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,100
Not only the play,

61
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,940
but also the performance.

62
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,100
What performance?

63
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,820
Look.

64
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Keep the smile.

65
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,740
Don't be fake.

66
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,540
Don't be too small.

67
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,900
You can do it.

68
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,740
Yifan.

69
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,140
Zhizhi.

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,780
Come in.

71
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,140
Happy New Year.

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,860
Happy New Year.

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,700
This is the new year present for you.

74
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,660
Thank you.

75
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Mom.

76
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,100
Yifan is here.

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,220
Happy New Year, aunt.

78
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,380
Happy New Year.

79
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:09,980
Mom.

80
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,740
Yifan brought you a present.

81
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,260
You can come directly next time.

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,180
Don't bring presents.

83
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,380
Sit down.

84
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,460
The dinner is ready.

85
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,020
I'll help you.

86
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,740
No need.

87
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,540
It's ready in a minute.

88
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Sit down.

89
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,060
Yifan is here.

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,220
Welcome.

91
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,260
Uncle, hello, New Year.

92
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,420
Hello, New Year.

93
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,660
Zhizhi and you watch TV first.

94
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,380
Okay.

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,460
Where are you going?

96
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,860
Watch TV.

97
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,460
Go to your own house to watch TV.

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,780
Mom, he's mad at me.

99
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,740
You're still a kid.

100
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,380
Tian'er.

101
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,540
Do you want to watch TV now?

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Do you have to manage it?

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,500
What TV?

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,340
You're a big man.

105
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,700
You're still a kid.

106
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,620
Go to your own house to help.

107
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,740
You're a kid.

108
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,900
How are you two?

109
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,100
I'll get the tea.

110
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,540
Is your brother and aunt unhappy?

111
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
Before you came,

112
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,940
they said he was about four hours old.

113
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,580
From your dinner,

114
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,420
you've been nagging him.

115
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,740
You said he didn't go home,

116
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,620
didn't text,

117
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,580
didn't call,

118
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,740
didn't talk to the camera.

119
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,860
He even asked for a meal

120
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,020
to burn his head.

121
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,340
If it weren't for you,

122
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,740
he wouldn't have come back.

123
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,260
He's just been nagging.

124
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,820
My brother must like you.

125
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,900
He even

126
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,060
listens to his teacher.

127
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,900
Come on.

128
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,860
Have some tea.

129
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,780
Thank you, uncle.

130
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,580
You just said don't be polite.

131
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
You're cold?

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,460
Let me see if you're hot.

133
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,580
What's wrong?

134
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,180
What's wrong?

135
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm cold.

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,540
No.

137
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,780
You're still cold.

138
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,220
What's wrong?

139
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,300
Your face is really bad.

140
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,740
Have you been nagging again?

141
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,820
Did you eat well?

142
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,060
Then I'll let you go home.

143
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,020
I'll give you a massage.

144
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,980
I won't go home.

145
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
I'm just a big boy.

146
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,140
You're a big boy.

147
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,940
No.

148
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,940
You'll be late

149
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,740
when I'm old.

150
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll give you a massage.

151
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,780
I'll give you a massage.

152
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,860
Look.

153
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,660
It's thin.

154
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,540
It's so good.

155
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,620
If I didn't meet him,

156
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,260
I would have been a little boy.

157
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,500
That's not good.

158
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,020
My brother suddenly

159
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,260
heard that a student

160
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,140
can go to Nanwu University

161
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,940
after a semester.

162
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,340
You encouraged him, didn't you?

163
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,620
We agreed to go to the same university

164
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,100
together.

165
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,660
But you've been doing it for a long time.

166
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,060
Is it a problem of the score?

167
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,660
No.

168
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,460
I didn't mean to go to Nanwu University.

169
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,700
Do you like others?

170
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,420
I've never liked others.

171
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,260
I used to be a bad person.

172
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,540
I didn't like them in the future.

173
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,420
He was really sad at that time.

174
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,820
It was the first time I felt

175
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,140
that he was like a mud dad.

176
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,860
He wasn't charming at all.

177
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,140
He locked himself in his room

178
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
and didn't care about anything.

179
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,860
I drink porridge.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,820
I drink medicine.

181
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,460
I eat fruit jelly

182
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,820
and don't need sugar.

183
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,860
In fact, he is not that mean.

184
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,540
Why?

185
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,380
He is smart,

186
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,820
so he can do anything.

187
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,540
He err too largely

188
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,620
and is rude with his family.

189
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,580
He thought that being a pro

190
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,180
can only do what he likes.

191
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,580
See that?

192
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,020
Support him closely.

193
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,420
Yet,iring someone else.

194
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,380
I can't help you, either.

195
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,380
Okay.

196
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,660
Wei Ying.

197
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,620
I can't believe it.

198
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,780
Until then,

199
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,860
after he met you like this,

200
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,100
he finally realized that

201
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,780
the world is not a circle of him.

202
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
Brother, what's wrong with you?

203
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,260
These two days,

204
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
my family has been

205
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,660
happy about you

206
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,060
going to Nanwu University.

207
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,220
They even asked me

208
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,380
to study hard like you.

209
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,140
What's so funny about me?

210
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,540
Am I that bad?

211
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,660
Who said you are bad?

212
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,580
Tell me now.

213
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,700
Don't be friends with him.

214
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,460
Brother,

215
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,500
you are lost.

216
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,660
What do you know?

217
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,900
Why don't I know?

218
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,900
You told me

219
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,500
when the prince couldn't find the princess,

220
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,700
it was like you.

221
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,060
What happened next?

222
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,900
The prince went through the exam.

223
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,860
He practiced all kinds of dance.

224
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,980
Through the snow mountain, desert,

225
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,780
and the forest of the monster.

226
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,580
Finally, he lost the princess.

227
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,180
Then they lived happily

228
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,500
together.

229
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,820
Monster,

230
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,500
you are so naughty.

231
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,380
I don't want to.

232
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,340
You don't know how nice

233
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
the cartoon is.

234
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,380
I'll give you a candy

235
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,300
to give you a candy.

236
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,380
It's me.

237
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Eat something.

238
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,540
No, no.

239
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Mom,

240
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,580
put your weight on my face.

241
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,420
Let me give you a hand to take off.

242
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,300
We don't want to change.

243
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,260
We don't want to change.

244
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,660
We want to be better.

245
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,940
Come on.

246
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,220
Have a bite.

247
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,700
Come on.

248
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Today is a family feast.

249
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,660
I didn't treat you as my husband.

250
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,540
Thank you, aunt.

251
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,700
You're welcome.

252
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,220
Come on.

253
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,700
I'm welcome.

254
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
Try my dish.

255
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,900
Have more.

256
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,140
This is your aunt's cooking.

257
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Is it the makeup on my face?

258
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,460
Doctor.

259
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,780
Yifan.

260
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,180
You're so pretty.

261
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Ping'er, you look at the child like this.

262
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
The child is embarrassed.

263
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
But Yifan,

264
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,780
since we met in the high school,

265
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
your aunt has always said that.

266
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Yes, she said that.

267
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
You said that our aunt and her husband

268
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
are compatible.

269
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
You're a girl.

270
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Yes, you're so pretty.

271
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
You're so pretty.

272
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
You're so pretty.

273
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
You're so pretty.

274
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
Why are you laughing?

275
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
Why didn't you say anything?

276
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
You're so cute.

277
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Go ahead.

278
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
Eat.

279
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,780
I'm trying to make you laugh.

280
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Actually,

281
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,780
we didn't leave early in the high school.

282
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
We were...

283
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I was on a business trip in Beiyu.

284
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,780
She came to me.

285
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,780
And we were together.

286
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
Anyway, this boy

287
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
liked you at first.

288
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
He didn't change.

289
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
He was so dead.

290
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,780
He thought we didn't know each other.

291
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Yes.

292
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
He didn't graduate from college for years.

293
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,780
He didn't have a boyfriend.

294
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
He was so bad to us.

295
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,780
We were so bad to him.

296
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
We were so scared of him.

297
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Yes, we were looking for a boyfriend.

298
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,780
He was looking for someone else.

299
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
The key is here.

300
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Here.

301
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Thank you, mom.

302
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Here.

303
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Thank you.

304
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
Here.

305
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,780
Do I have a hat?

306
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
Of course.

307
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,780
You'll be our family in the future.

308
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Take it.

309
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,780
Take it.

310
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Take it.

311
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
Thank you, auntie.

312
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,780
You're welcome.

313
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Hurry up.

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Here.

315
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Yes.

316
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Drink less.

317
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Drink more.

318
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,780
This one.

319
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
It smells good.

320
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,780
Finally, I have a family.

321
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
Being able to be a family with them

322
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,780
is a good way to be hugged by love.

323
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
It's so good.

324
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Yifan, this is my room.

325
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
Sit down.

326
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
You can sleep with me tonight.

327
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Let me tell you my secret.

328
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
I'll answer the phone first.

329
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,780
Okay.

330
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Hello, Jiaxu.

331
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
Jiaxu, happy new year.

332
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,780
Happy new year.

333
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
There's a dumpling.

334
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,780
And my mom cooked ribs.

335
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
Happy new year.

336
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
Are you okay?

337
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
I'm fine.

338
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Where did you see it?

339
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,780
The door is locked.

340
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
The door is locked.

341
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,780
I'll open it.

342
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,780
You're not sleeping?

343
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
Jiaxu.

344
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Can't you sleep?

345
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,780
I'll sleep later.

346
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
You want to sleep with me?

347
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
No.

348
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
No.

349
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,780
Why aren't you sleeping?

350
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,780
I'm waiting.

351
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,780
I'm waiting.

352
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,780
I'm waiting.

353
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,780
Okay.

354
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
Okay.

355
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,780
I'll sleep with you tonight.

356
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
Okay.

357
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,780
What are you going to do tomorrow?

358
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
I like your house.

359
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
I can raise someone like you.

360
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
Someone like me?

361
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Who am I?

362
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,780
I'm proud.

363
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,780
I'm confident.

364
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm hot-blooded.

365
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Like light.

366
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Zeyi.

367
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Your sister has a name.

368
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,780
Her name is Zhizhi.

369
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,780
Do you have one?

370
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Do you want to be the first doctor?

371
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
Yan Yan.

372
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
Aunt.

373
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
You must be dreaming.

374
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
What are you talking about?

375
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
It's still the second one.

376
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,780
Yan Yan.

377
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Okay, I don't have one.

378
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Then...

379
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,780
I'll call you Yan.

380
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
I'll go to bed.

381
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
You...

382
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
What did you call me?

383
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,780
Aunt.

384
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Then...

385
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
What's your name?

386
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Okay, I'll go to bed.

387
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,780
Good night.

388
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
Good night.

389
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Good night.

390
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,780
Good night.

391
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
How is your hand?

392
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
Are you tired?

393
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
Yes.

394
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
Do you need my help?

395
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Help me put on the book.

396
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Okay.

397
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
The office is almost here.

398
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
We have to hurry.

399
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:27,580
K

400
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Who is he?

401
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,780
He must be a strong man.

402
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,780
He played the ghost child in the dream.

403
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Did you forget?

404
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,780
We saw many times together.

405
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
I don't remember.

406
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
He's a kid.

407
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
He's good at acting.

408
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
How come I remember

409
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
someone's eyes

410
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
when someone looked at me?

411
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
You're wrong.

412
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,780
I saw it for real.

413
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
That kid's face is white.

414
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
He's a good boy.

415
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Are you still in the box?

416
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,780
I can't put it down.

417
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
I think there's a box in my room.

418
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
I'll take a look.

419
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
Okay.

420
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,780
I'll help you take the photo.

421
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Okay.

422
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,780
Do you still need the box?

423
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
I'll take a look.

424
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Can you hide it?

425
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I'll love your heart.

426
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Don't wander around in the dream.

427
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Recently,

428
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,780
I've been in the airport.

429
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
I can't finish it.

430
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
It's not like what I've been doing.

431
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Later.

432
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,780
Don't you ever hide

433
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,780
this time.

434
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,780
This is my first

435
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
post-it article.

436
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
This is the one

437
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
that was written

438
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,780
on the official press conference.

439
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
How is it?

440
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Are you excited?

441
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
How is it?

442
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
Are you excited?

443
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,780
I'll have a cup of red soup.

444
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,780
Have a drink.

445
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Thank you.

446
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,780
I've been to many places.

447
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,780
I think you've said it.

448
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
No matter what,

449
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,780
I'll always be there for you.

450
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
What's wrong?

451
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,780
I want to drink.

452
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
Don't cry.

453
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Before I was with you,

454
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
I didn't meet you.

455
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
I've been alone

456
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,780
for many times.

457
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,780
Actually,

458
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
I need to give you a hint.

459
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,780
I saw you when I was having a date.

460
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,780
But I thought I saw the wrong person.

461
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,780
I'm not a good person.

462
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
You're a good person.

463
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
If you recognize me,

464
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,780
I'll be embarrassed.

465
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,780
I can't run away from you.

466
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
I should have gone to find you

467
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
when I was with you.

468
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,780
Why am I

469
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,780
so bad to you?

470
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
What are you doing?

471
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,780
We've been together for a long time.

472
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Or...

473
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
you've done something

474
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
that's wrong to me.

475
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
I...

476
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
I'm lying to you.

477
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,780
I...

478
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,780
I've done something cheap to you.

479
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,780
You've done something cheap to me?

480
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
What's going on every day?

481
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
Before we were together.

482
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,780
Before we were together?

483
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
I have a fake-dress

484
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
to cover your face.

485
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
A gentle and gentle woman.

486
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
You've seen this kind of thing?

487
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Just think of it as a reminder

488
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
that you're my right.

489
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
It's not a good time to be honest.

490
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,780
You're still being like this.

491
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Don't cry.

492
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
You're not going to take it?

493
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
No.

494
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
A Yan.

495
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,780
I want to stay longer than you.

496
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,780
Why?

497
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
So I can stay longer.

498
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
I've been

499
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
so busy

500
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
that I've been

501
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
leaving these days.

502
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
I'm just being flat.

503
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
What do you mean?

504
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,780
I've got nothing to do with it.

505
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
But I still want to be more active

506
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
and spend my next life.

507
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Next life,

508
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
you can like my message first.

509
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Then

510
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,780
I'll let you

511
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,780
be as happy as I am now.

512
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
What does this password mean?

513
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,780
What do you think?

514
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,780
It's not your birthday

515
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
nor mine.

516
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
It's the first time we met.

517
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
This table is not...

518
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,780
Where's the rest?

519
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,780
The cabinet is the same.

520
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
The sofa is the same.

521
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Look.

522
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,780
It's like the one we had before.

523
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
It's new.

524
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
I'm afraid you're not used to it.

525
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,780
I'm afraid you're not used to it.

526
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
I'm afraid you're not used to it.

527
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
I'm afraid you're not used to it.

528
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
So I'll just follow the style.

529
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Which one do you want to sleep with?

530
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
Which one do you want to sleep with?

531
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,780
The kitchen and the toilet.

532
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,780
I'm not picky about it.

533
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
I can sleep with you.

534
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Why?

535
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
You're going to sleep with me?

536
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Is this a wedding notice?

537
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Isn't this a matter of time?

538
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
I can't say it's my strength.

539
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
What's your heart?

540
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
When did you make it?

541
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
Last year.

542
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
To make it common,

543
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
I had to make it again.

544
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,780
You brought it back with you.

545
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,780
It's good.

546
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,780
MUSIC

547
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,780
It turns out the cat dishonored others byобы a dog.

548
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Is it the same Husheng as that dog just now?

549
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
It's impossible.

550
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,780
The boss of this company can say that he's the boss of the restaurant.

551
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
I'm sorry.

552
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,780
I've finally come to you.

553
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
We dropped a bracelet on the table last night.

554
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,780
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
I'm sorry.

558
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,780
I'm sorry.

559
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,780
I'm sorry.
