1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
The world is full of people.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,960
You are the one who is in the bed.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate is like a wind.

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe it's because of you.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,720
When you are in the heart,

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,640
you are in the heart.

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,000
I doubt that I am you.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,120
I am determined to be a man.

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,640
I am willing to be a man for you.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,800
The world is watching me.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,040
I am left and right.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,480
All day, I will only remember.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,040
All the wind and rain are the wind.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,960
It's because of you.

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,640
It's because of you.

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,520
How can I be a man?

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,040
The world is full of people.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,080
Even if there is someone at the end,

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,640
I will be a man.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,920
I am willing to be a man for you.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,800
The world is watching me.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,400
I am willing to be a man for you.

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I am with you.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I have loved you before.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,920
The world is watching me.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,120
Do you know how much money is spent on dancing?

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,880
You are too young.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,800
If you don't want to lose your sense of humor, you should lose it.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't need your money, Mr. Qin.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Can I practice by myself?

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,320
Where should I dance?

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,160
Do you live in a living room?

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
Or do you do dance lessons?

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,880
Can you make for free this time is very expensive?

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,100
If I open my heart, I won't understand you can only find ten positive points.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,400
Truly, howrai is different!

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,560
Our lives should still be the same.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,540
To come back, you should send our love to Wei Yong first.

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,880
Or, his love will be anłem no matter what.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,040
No matter where you go,

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,560
that will only bring unosobleable trouble to Yu اسipp on your heart!

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,540
I saw just the time you became impulsive.

43
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
I'm very nervous.

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Isn't the certificate also required?

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,540
He doesn't learn art.

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
He can't even go to university.

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
So I have to give up dancing, right?

48
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
I know.

49
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,540
I'm very nervous.

50
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
I'm very nervous.

51
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
What are you doing at the door?

52
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
Come in.

53
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Come in.

54
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Where are we going?

55
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Are we going out to the stairs today?

56
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
I'm tired, Qi Man.

57
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,540
What are you doing here?

58
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,540
I'm just here to do some dancing.

59
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
What are you doing?

60
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
Thank you.

61
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
If you don't feel right, tell me.

62
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
I'm very nervous.

63
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I'm very nervous.

64
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
How much is she?

65
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Not much.

66
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,540
Who's that?

67
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Who is it?

68
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Who is it?

69
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
Xiao Xiao.

70
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
Xiao Xiao, come on.

71
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Who is it?

72
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Who is it?

73
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Give it to me.

74
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
Xiao Xiao.

75
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
Xiao Xiao.

76
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
Xiao Xiao.

77
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
I can't sleep.

78
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
When I like you, you say

79
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
if you want to be so strong,

80
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,540
you want to see the beauty?

81
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,540
I want to see the beauty.

82
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Xiao Xiao.

83
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,540
Xiao Xiao.

84
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,540
Xiao Xiao.

85
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Xiao Xiao.

86
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
Xiao Xiao.

87
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,540
Mayfa.

88
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,540
What does he mean?

89
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,900
Yes I love you

90
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,940
So, what do you want me to do?

91
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,740
Finish the job

92
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,260
Get as much as possible

93
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,220
It's fine

94
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,360
Soon I'll be capable of activating your body.

95
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,960
Tell me immediately.

96
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
Okay.

97
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes

98
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,680
Wura

99
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,580
You

100
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,000
the more squeaky in110

101
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,120
nothing

102
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm not sure.

103
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I'm not sure.

104
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm not sure.

105
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I'm not sure.

106
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
I'm not sure.

107
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
I'm not sure.

108
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm not sure.

109
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm not sure.

110
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm not sure.

111
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm not sure.

112
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
I'm not sure.

113
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm not sure.

114
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm not sure.

115
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm not sure.

116
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
I'm not sure.

117
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I'm not sure.

118
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm not sure.

119
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
I'm not sure.

120
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I'm not sure.

121
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
I'm not sure.

122
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm not sure.

123
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm not sure.

124
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm not sure.

125
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm not sure.

126
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
I'm not sure.

127
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm not sure.

128
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm not sure.

129
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm not sure.

130
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm not sure.

131
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
I'm not sure.

132
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
I'm not sure.

133
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
I'm not sure.

134
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
I'm not sure.

135
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
I'm not sure.

136
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,960
So I choose the number

137
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
whether it is pick up or not.

138
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,860
Have youская

139
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,360
whoever does the number

140
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
For the meaning to

141
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,120
know the person

142
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,160
What kind of answer are you

143
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
studying in the front?

144
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm a little worried

145
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
about CoraOk

146
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
The last call

147
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,860
Why?

148
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,980
We tried to put the battery warm.

149
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,540
Send it back to us.

150
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,820
Be careful.

151
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,340
Don't be afraid.

152
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Be careful.

153
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Don't you have to find a place to stay?

154
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
You sent me a message yesterday.

155
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Did something happen?

156
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:22,860
pocket

157
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,200
What do you mean

158
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Never thought it happened

159
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,540
It's still not likely.

160
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,280
How fascinating.

161
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:48,200
Still

162
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,620
I know everything about Hitomi,

163
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
What's the meaning of this?

164
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
It's not responsible?

165
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
Morning, sister. Morning.

166
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
What's wrong?

167
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
What's wrong?

168
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,620
Did you rest well?

169
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
I had a dream about it.

170
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
I don't know if all the pregnant women are like this.

171
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
You've worked hard.

172
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
It's not easy.

173
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
How are you feeling now?

174
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm fine.

175
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
I just had a dream last night.

176
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,620
What dream?

177
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Tell me.

178
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Let me stay here for a while.

179
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
I can wake up now.

180
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
I just...

181
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
I had a dream that I suddenly had a big, big body.

182
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
I kept walking.

183
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
I wanted to find the exit.

184
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
But I couldn't find it.

185
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,620
I was walking and the sky suddenly disappeared.

186
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
I started to get very cold.

187
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
I kept walking.

188
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,620
I suddenly remembered that I was on the way.

189
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
I saw the sun.

190
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
I thought about it.

191
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I went back to find the sun and it was very warm.

192
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I walked and I found the sun.

193
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
The sky is dark.

194
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Where did the sun come from?

195
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
So it was a dream.

196
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
That's it?

197
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,620
I walked out when I saw the sun.

198
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,620
I walked out when I saw the sun.

199
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,620
I still remember that when I saw the sun,

200
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,620
I couldn't bear to hug it.

201
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,620
I still remember that when I saw the sun,

202
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,620
I couldn't bear to hug it.

203
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
This dream...

204
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,620
It's hard to find.

205
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Don't understand a word?

206
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,280
This email?

207
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,180
I've checked your emails,

208
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,380
if there are any foreign friends,

209
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,160
please call me.

210
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,660
I need to contact your driver,

211
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,300
who is your assistant darling.

212
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,340
Come on.

213
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,100
There is a fire on it.

214
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,460
The owner of the city in the middle of last time

215
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,580
is our channel's hot person now.

216
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,060
The leader wants to make a follow-up report while playing the game.

217
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,860
That person is the high school classmate of Yifan.

218
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,020
That's good.

219
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,580
You asked Yifan to contact you.

220
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,340
You called the exit tomorrow.

221
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,620
Chuan Jie has already been watching Yifan alone.

222
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,020
He can't let her work overtime.

223
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,820
Okay, Miss?

224
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,380
There is another one that is not too late. Go and sit.

225
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,140
Okay.

226
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,820
Give it to me.

227
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,580
What?

228
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,020
Your high school classmate is calling.

229
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,180
You are embarrassed.

230
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,660
I'll ask her first.

231
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,900
Okay.

232
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,380
Hello, welcome.

233
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,820
I'm looking for someone to ask you a question.

234
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,860
Okay.

235
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,500
Qiao Qiao.

236
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,820
Come on.

237
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,380
Why did you find such a high-class restaurant?

238
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,500
Didn't you say you wanted to find a quiet place?

239
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,900
Are you hungry?

240
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,540
Look.

241
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,820
What do you want to eat?

242
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,900
Can you recommend it to me?

243
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,500
We have a restaurant that just launched.

244
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,340
We are not...

245
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,740
We just want to buy a restaurant.

246
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,500
Okay, wait a minute.

247
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,980
Mr. Xiang.

248
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,420
Do you remember this bracelet?

249
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,900
Did I give you that one?

250
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,180
You have always been wearing it.

251
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,900
Since you gave me that one, I have always been wearing it.

252
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,660
Although sometimes it's not that big,

253
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,100
I also wear it.

254
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,820
Qiao Qiao, actually...

255
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,740
I've always wanted to ask you.

256
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,180
Was the bracelet that I gave you

257
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,540
just a birthday gift?

258
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,780
I don't really understand what you mean.

259
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,260
I just want to ask you.

260
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,700
Did you like me a little bit

261
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,660
when you gave me this bracelet?

262
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,020
Qiao Qiao, did I make you misunderstand?

263
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,220
I'm sorry.

264
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,180
We have always been good friends.

265
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,140
I'm sorry.

266
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,140
I'm really thinking too much.

267
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,300
But...

268
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
I want to be

269
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,300
a person who can be considered

270
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
as a partner.

271
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Actually, I...

272
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
It seems that I can't eat

273
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
the cake today.

274
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
Let's order something else.

275
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,300
Waitress.

276
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm here.

277
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
I've been waiting for a long time.

278
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,300
You haven't ordered yet?

279
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Actually, I just wanted to say that

280
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,300
we're not two people today.

281
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
It's three.

282
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
What's wrong?

283
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
You're being so weird.

284
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,300
No.

285
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I misunderstood Xiang Lang.

286
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,300
It's my fault.

287
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
You can still let Qiao Qiao

288
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
apologize to you.

289
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
It's not like you.

290
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Let's order something first.

291
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
You eat.

292
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I have something to do.

293
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Qiao Qiao.

294
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
What's wrong with you?

295
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
It's all my fault.

296
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Listen to me explain to you two.

297
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Actually, that bracelet

298
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
was the one I wanted to drag you

299
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
to give it to Dian Dian.

300
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Qiao Qiao.

301
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Xiang Lang.

302
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,300
I'm sorry.

303
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,300
I called you out at such a late hour.

304
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
No.

305
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
It's rare for you to ask me out.

306
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm sorry.

307
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
I'm sorry.

308
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Don't worry.

309
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
I'm gonna go to the US tomorrow.

310
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm going to go to the US tomorrow.

311
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
Okay.

312
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
I need my parents.

313
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
They've already ordered

314
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
the tickets to the US tomorrow.

315
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
So...

316
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
I want...

317
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
I thought you and Dian Dian

318
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
forgot my birthday.

319
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Thank you.

320
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,460
I'll give you a ticket.

321
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,260
What's the reason?

322
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,060
For a reason?

323
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,180
I'm going to study in the US.

324
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,420
I should have told you clearly.

325
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,420
I should have given her my heart.

326
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,660
It's all my fault.

327
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,100
Dingding.

328
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,900
Actually, when I was in high school,

329
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,100
I found out that I had a different feeling about you.

330
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,180
What are you talking about?

331
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm the one who should apologize.

332
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,060
I'm the one who's so affectionate.

333
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,740
Dad has been doing this for so many years.

334
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,980
He doesn't belong to me.

335
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,380
You guys eat.

336
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,300
I have a list.

337
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,820
Qiao Qiao.

338
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,500
Qiao Qiao.

339
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,980
Dingding, I...

340
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,740
Hello, Mr. Qin.

341
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,660
Hello.

342
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,380
Okay.

343
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,620
I'll be there soon.

344
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,700
Dingding, where are you going?

345
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,820
To the TV station.

346
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,420
Get in the car.

347
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,020
I'll see you out.

348
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,220
I'll talk to you upstairs.

349
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,260
No wonder she asked you to come.

350
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,620
Come on.

351
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,140
Come on.

352
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,500
No need to ventilate.

353
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,220
It's what you wanted.

354
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,740
I'm not a girl.

355
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
You can answer me.

356
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
This person reported to my friend.

357
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
He was unconscious in the second day.

358
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
What does this mean?

359
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Can you call the police

360
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
for this irresponsible behavior?

361
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I'm not a girl.

362
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
I'm not a girl.

363
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,740
I'm not a girl.

364
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
I'm not a girl.

365
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
I'm not a girl.

366
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
I think it's not appropriate

367
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
to report to you.

368
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Are you crazy?

369
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
Why are you calling the police?

370
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
But it's mainly because

371
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
I want to see how your friend

372
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
and this girl

373
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
get along.

374
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Maybe it's not good for

375
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
this girl

376
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
to feel better.

377
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
So

378
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
this report

379
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
doesn't mean anything.

380
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
It's between friends.

381
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm not sure

382
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
what's going on

383
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
with them.

384
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,740
So I can't

385
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
provide any reference value

386
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
for this report.

387
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
What about you?

388
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,740
How's the relationship?

389
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
How's the relationship?

390
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
My goddess

391
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
has been chasing me for half a year.

392
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
What are you talking about?

393
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm telling you

394
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
very clearly.

395
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
She just sent me

396
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
a box of chocolate

397
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
for Valentine's Day.

398
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Not a hug.

399
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
And the girl said

400
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
she won't contact me

401
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
after she sent me the chocolate.

402
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
That person

403
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
loves her.

404
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Your friend

405
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
is quite big.

406
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
Did this girl

407
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
confess to your friend?

408
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
What?

409
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
It's a bit different

410
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,740
from the logic.

411
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
If this girl

412
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
really loves your friend,

413
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
then

414
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
the meaning of this report

415
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
should be clear.

416
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
But your friend

417
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
doesn't need

418
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
to discuss this with you.

419
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
So you mean

420
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
the wedding of the four spirits?

421
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
I just told your friend

422
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,740
that

423
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
it seems like this girl

424
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,740
has never

425
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
expressed her feelings

426
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,740
before.

427
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
So is it possible

428
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
that your friend

429
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
made a mistake?

430
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,740
She made a mistake?

431
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
She made a mistake?

432
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Simply put,

433
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
it's just

434
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
she made a mistake.

435
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
Do you hear that?

436
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
She's so nice.

437
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
Don't disturb me.

438
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
I'm a fool.

439
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,740
You're done.

440
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,740
What's your problem?

441
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
You.

442
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
I thought you'd be done.

443
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
What's the problem?

444
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Su Haon said in the group

445
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,740
that you've been to the medical box recently.

446
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
You're looking for me?

447
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,740
What group?

448
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
How did I not see you?

449
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,740
This group is not you.

450
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
Interesting.

451
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,740
I don't know.

452
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
Don't be so mean.

453
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
You always say

454
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
you've been to the medical box

455
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
not once.

456
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,740
What are you going to do?

457
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Are you in love?

458
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
What's the matter?

459
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
Have you been in love

460
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
for eight years?

461
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
No.

462
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Have you been to the medical box?

463
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
No.

464
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
Have you been in love

465
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
for seven years?

466
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
No.

467
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
What is the matter?

468
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
I don't know.

469
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,740
You've been to the medical box.

470
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,740
I'm not sure.

471
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
I'm not sure.

472
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
Have you been to the medical box?

473
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
No.

474
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
What's your problem?

475
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
No.

476
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,740
I'm not sure.

477
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,740
I'm sorry.

478
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
I can't help you.

480
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,740
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,740
Don't worry.

482
00:33:40,740 --> 00:34:08,320
Raping eyes Spe PARA

483
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,120
Grandfather

484
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,400
I've already written all your things.

485
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,520
If you need anything, just tell me.

486
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,320
Thank you.

487
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,840
Miss Fu is taking you upstairs.

488
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,000
Be careful.

489
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,640
Grandpa, we're leaving.

490
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,240
Goodbye.

491
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I really didn't blame you.

492
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,040
Who could blame someone like that?

493
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,760
I might just need some time.

494
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,680
I think you can't understand me.

495
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,360
I ran away.

496
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,040
I won't open the door.

497
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,080
I can't open the door.

498
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,360
I can't open the door.

499
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I can't open the door.

500
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I can't open the door.

501
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
I can't open the door.

502
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
I can't open the door.

503
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,240
I can't open the door.

504
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,720
To be self-sufficient,

505
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,920
I can leave without hesitation.

506
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,560
I think I'm not the kind of woman

507
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,240
you think I am.

508
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,080
It's really worth it.

509
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,680
I've made it clear to Xiang Lang.

510
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I don't want us to have any misunderstandings.

511
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,840
It's not because of me.

512
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,680
If I'm really with Xiang Lang,

513
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
would you be in a relationship with me?

514
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Of course not.

515
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,080
What age is this?

516
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,680
Who would be in a relationship with a man?

517
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,080
Actually, the reason I reject Xiang Lang the most

518
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,480
is because I don't have feelings for him.

519
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,080
I don't want to be in a relationship with him.

520
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I don't want to be in a relationship with him.

521
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I don't want to be in a relationship with him.

522
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,080
It's just like he's the same as me.

523
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
But Xiang Lang,

524
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
he's still your good friend to us.

525
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,880
I don't want to grow up at all.

526
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,280
After growing up, things have become complicated.

527
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,080
How about being single like before?

528
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Falling in love makes people more complicated.

529
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,080
This is the emotion that a couple in love has.

530
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Let's empty the bad emotions.

531
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
One of them is the opposite.

532
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Come.

533
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
You can't even think of opening it.

534
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Look at me.

535
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,080
What you see now is the series of our Nilan.

536
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Nilan's development and happiness

537
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,080
also represents the full meaning of life and happiness.

538
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
It's so beautiful.

539
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
The one before was too expensive.

540
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
I worked with it.

541
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
It's still a good thing.

542
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
It's really beautiful.

543
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
You'll choose it.

544
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
You'll be good to yourself.

545
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
But we're like a movie.

546
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
We're not men.

547
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Don't fight.

548
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Okay.

549
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
There will be no men in the future.

550
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Only the best.

551
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Here.

552
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Today, you're a little bit new.

553
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
The taste of the new interest

554
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,080
is suitable for the taste of the next love.

555
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Try it.

556
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I've always been curious about something.

557
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
But I didn't ask you.

558
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,080
You used to be so beautiful.

559
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
You're so beautiful.

560
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Didn't you like Sang Ye before?

561
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Why are you so cold-hearted?

562
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
Because he's handsome.

563
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
And he's really good-looking.

564
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Although I never said a few words to him in high school,

565
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I know he seems to like you a lot.

566
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,080
And he's nice to you.

567
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
If you don't say anything,

568
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I'll think you're a stranger.

569
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Okay.

570
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
You mean I can be your stranger?

571
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Are you serious?

572
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Why do you have this reaction?

573
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
You used to like Sang Ye.

574
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
What about now? Do you like him?

575
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
How long has it been?

576
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You're working together now.

577
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
You're getting along.

578
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,080
You're still being nice to each other.

579
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
What if you fall in love?

580
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
No.

581
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
He's moving out soon.

582
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,080
You mean if he lives longer,

583
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
you might not be able to eat it?

584
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Why didn't you two be together then?

585
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,080
I know you moved out of school.

586
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
So you two have nothing to do with each other.

587
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,080
But why?

588
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,080
I don't know if other people are the same as me.

589
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I...

590
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I've told my friends in college

591
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,080
that I'm a very close friend.

592
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
I'm good at relationships.

593
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,080
But I think I've broken up after graduation.

594
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,080
I'm almost too much to contact them.

595
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,080
They're quite sad about this.

596
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
I admit it.

597
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm just like you.

598
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,080
We rarely contact each other after we're out of school.

599
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
I think

600
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,080
we're always together.

601
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
We're always together.

602
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
It's all natural.

603
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,080
So I felt

604
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
like

605
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,080
I was in love with

606
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,080
someone like him.

607
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
I'm sorry.

610
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm sorry.

611
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm sorry.

612
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I'm sorry.

613
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I'm sorry.

614
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
I'm sorry.

615
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm sorry.

617
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm sorry.

618
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
I'm sorry.

619
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
I'm sorry.

620
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
I'm sorry.

621
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
What?

622
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I'm sorry.

623
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,080
I'm sorry.

624
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Why does she look so unhappy now?

625
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,720
Don't have time.

626
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,280
I don't want to leave you.

627
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,620
want to watch the beautiful people go out?

628
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,400
My every effort has its meaning

629
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,400
With the time, the moon, the long river

630
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,000
Wait together

631
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,640
Like sunshine, warm and cold

632
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,480
Give me a good time

633
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,160
You are in the wind

634
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,560
It doesn't want me to come

635
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,320
You are always standing by my side

636
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,440
For me and guess

637
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,960
This road is hard to stop

638
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,520
The rain is full of the sky

639
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
But I have you

640
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,920
Like you

641
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,520
Can show the darkness before my eyes

642
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,520
All the thoughts and memories are you

643
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Now we are clear and beautiful

644
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Every rain falls down and scattered you

645
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,520
It's not a fixed rate

646
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,520
Every white and white big news I want to tell you

647
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,520
We will go through this journey together

648
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,520
I won't give up, I will be here

649
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,520
With you

650
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,520
You are in the wind

651
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,520
It doesn't want me to come

652
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
You are always standing by my side

653
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,520
For me and guess

654
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,520
This road is hard to stop

655
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,520
The rain is full of the sky

656
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,520
But I have you

657
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,520
I won't give up, I won't give up

658
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,520
You give me a good time

659
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,520
You are in the wind

660
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,520
It doesn't want me to come

661
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,520
Every white and white big news I want to tell you

662
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,520
We will go through this journey together

663
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,520
I want you

664
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Can show the darkness before my eyes
