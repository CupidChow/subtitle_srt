I'm afraid that I'll be able to do anything.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've loved you before.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
To your eyes

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I heard that they started their first day of school.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I heard that they started their first day of school.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really?

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is that how it was by the way?

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
These two days, they were always late together.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I heard that they've been together for one hour.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The first two days.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Interesting!

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The first two days were really too early.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,620
The Grandpa will be well known my sisters

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,100
who will speak more speed with her

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,500
At this moment

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,960
Why they talk

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,080
listen!

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,780
Don't you know us?

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,820
Of course

36
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,460
his relationship...

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,460
Did your dad say that?

38
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,780
Did he like you?

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,140
How can you not give you aï¿½

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,940
that love,

41
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,220
when you've pregnant?

42
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,020
I never care about you

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,220
Luan, why are you following me?

44
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,020
I'm a big fan of Guo Mingzhen

45
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,220
Wei Yi Fan, do you know

46
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,620
that there's a kind of company called Pei Pou Yuan?

47
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,220
I don't know

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,020
It's just that we're practicing running with someone

49
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Go

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,220
It's okay

51
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,020
Are you practicing running with me?

52
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,020
Try to practice running with me

53
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Aren't you running?

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,020
Ride the carriage

55
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,320
Ride the carriage

56
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,020
I love you

57
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,020
I love you

58
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Good day, teacher

59
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Don't move

60
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
I'll call the police

61
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,020
I'll ask you to come here

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
What's going on?

63
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,020
Sorry

64
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
What's going on?

65
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Nothing

66
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
I need to write a letter

67
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
So many?

68
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Old uncle

69
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Let me leave him alone

70
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
You must assure me

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,020
You think it's okay?

72
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,740
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,700
This is not my stuff.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,140
This is the money that you gave me.

75
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Did you give me the wrong one?

76
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,380
There's a discount.

77
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm afraid I'll give it to someone else.

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,180
If I can't use it, I'll throw it away.

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,180
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,180
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,180
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,180
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,180
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,180
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,180
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,180
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,180
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
Is this your gift?

94
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,180
It's a gift from Sang Yan.

95
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,780
I kissed you through life

96
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
So much?

97
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,980
Can you help me hear your freezing night?

98
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,780
Don't you ever hide this time

99
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,380
Ooh ooh

100
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Come on

101
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,580
What do you mean?

102
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,420
Play with you.

103
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,260
What do you mean?

104
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,820
This is the money you gave me.

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,300
Why are you so awkward?

106
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,420
The daily life of Emu Loan

107
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,300
Don't impede, it is capitalize

108
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,660
You bring me too much money,

109
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,740
Now I make it back.

110
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,900
Do you have this bag of luggage?

111
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,820
Ha...

112
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,060
Ha...

113
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,700
Do you think I meant it?

114
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,380
It's true.

115
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,060
I totally understand.

116
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,220
Not like I was wrong.

117
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,860
I know my Falun.

118
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,500
Excuse me for the previous one.

119
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,660
I'm ihrger.

120
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,100
It's probably 500F.

121
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,940
Turn it around.

122
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,220
Turn it around.

123
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,500
Turn it around for 15 yuan.

124
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,220
You can transfer it to your WeChat account.

125
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,740
How can it be 520?

126
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,860
How can it be 250?

127
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,220
I understand you.

128
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,940
Are you Lev and Chen wiring around,

129
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,900
because Iantic in your house?

130
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,340
Whatever.

131
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,060
Hello.

132
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,180
You still want to...

133
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,780
I...

134
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,060
I haven't come back yet.

135
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,220
Mom, I'll hang up first.

136
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220
I'll go home later.

137
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,420
Why did you open the door?

138
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Why am I here?

139
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
Why?

140
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,260
Why am I here?

141
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
How do I know?

142
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,060
What are you doing?

143
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,460
What's wrong?

144
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm not feeling well.

145
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,260
I'm not going to see you.

146
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,860
I don't want to.

147
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,860
You should go.

148
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,860
I'm a student.

149
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,460
I'll see if you're okay.

150
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,860
Is the wine so good?

151
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,660
Don't worry.

152
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,060
The training is like this.

153
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,660
We used to get used to

154
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,260
the sweet life like this.

155
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
Bring it here.

156
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,260
I'm not going to drink it.

157
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I'm not going to drink it.

158
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
I'm not going to drink it.

159
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Come on.

160
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Your whiskey.

161
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Drink less.

162
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Don't.

163
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I'm not hungry.

164
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
I'll drink some more.

165
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
What are you doing?

166
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
I'm wearing a dress!

167
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
How can I wear a dress?

168
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm wearing a dress!

169
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
This is your house.

170
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Ask me.

171
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Do we have...

172
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
No.

173
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
I...

174
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I...

175
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I've been in a daze.

176
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
I don't remember.

177
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
You remember it, right?

178
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Yes.

179
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I remember it.

180
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
Yes.

181
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,260
That's good.

182
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,260
What's good?

183
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
What?

184
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
I'm not a good girl.

185
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
I'm a doctor.

186
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
I'm not going to lie down.

187
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
Then I'll wear it.

188
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Don't ask me.

189
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
I'll wear it.

190
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
You're so messy.

191
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
I said don't run.

192
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,260
I'm not going to run.

193
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
How did I get in?

194
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Look.

195
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Explain.

196
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Why are you following me?

197
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,260
You took me down.

198
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Did you bring me home?

199
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,260
You're so clumsy.

200
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
I just helped you.

201
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I didn't want you to follow me.

202
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
You're so annoying.

203
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Why are you bothering me?

204
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Do you think I'm a person?

205
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,260
I'm going to pull you down.

206
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
You're going to hook me up.

207
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
Why are you still following me?

208
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
I didn't say I was going to hook you.

209
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
You're going to hook me.

210
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
You're going to save you.

211
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Why are you telling me?

212
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Qi Yunfang.

213
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
You still want me to jump?

214
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
You can see for yourself.

215
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
To be honest,

216
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
I think the audience

217
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
is more like you.

218
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Why is it that

219
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
you're not in my wish now?

220
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
It's my wish.

221
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Keep watching.

222
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,260
What?

223
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
We can only get to this

224
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
in our audition.

225
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
As for what you did

226
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
after you closed the door,

227
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
we can't do anything.

228
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
We didn't do anything.

229
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
True feelings, yes?

231
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
This is new.

232
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
My tycker- oxidiser fever.

233
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,100
No.

234
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,220
I'll eat it.

235
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,820
We're just on the same level.

236
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,460
Come on, let's drink together.

237
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,960
You used it to remove this apple.

238
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,620
You can't hm

239
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,740
Okay. I'll save it for later.

240
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,780
fossils

241
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,140
I understand go

242
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,540
Right

243
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,180
How do you look at your door

244
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,220
She said your hair is pretty dark now.

245
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,460
It has cleared her hair entirely.

246
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,020
Let's go.

247
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,660
I'm gonna get some rest.

248
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,620
OK.

249
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,020
I think her hair is pretty dark.

250
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,940
I need to go to the doctor now.

251
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,700
Yes, I need to go to the doctor.

252
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,940
Hello, Xiao Xiao?

253
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,060
Especially when I was ast ê±°ì¼ with a incapacitated settler.

254
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,620
She's drinking so bad.

255
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,260
Hello, Ming Tian.

256
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,140
Xia Lang.

257
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,540
Didn't I ask you to hide it?

258
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,220
You're not even surprised.

259
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,020
I'm surprised.

260
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,500
Xiao Xiao, you really don't want to talk to me.

261
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,300
I've told you before.

262
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,420
I've told you several times.

263
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,500
You've returned to China.

264
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,220
You didn't listen to me.

265
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I might have forgotten it.

266
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,460
Where are you now?

267
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,620
At the airport.

268
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,500
I wanted to tell you to give it to him.

269
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,180
But he said he was afraid you'd work.

270
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,980
He didn't want to get up so early.

271
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,180
Morning.

272
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,180
Morning.

273
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,020
Morning.

274
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,980
I just woke up.

275
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,300
Xia Lang, you're coming back to rent a room.

276
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,980
Why don't you be my roommate?

277
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,220
I forgot to tell you.

278
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,540
I found my roommate.

279
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Who?

280
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,020
Shall we

281
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
go to the hotel together?

282
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,540
Yes, of course.

283
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
How many people have you seen?

284
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,700
Four.

285
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,020
I'm not going to work.

286
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,180
Then don't call me.

287
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,980
Don't worry.

288
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,900
How can I?

289
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,100
Then four.

290
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,020
Bye.

291
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,220
Bye.

292
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,620
Love you.

293
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,340
Do you want to go out?

294
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,500
My old friend is back to China.

295
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,340
He's Xia Lang.

296
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
When we were in high school,

297
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,180
he was in class 17.

298
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,820
He was in class 15 with Qiao Qiao.

299
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,460
We grew up in the kindergarten.

300
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,860
You must know him.

301
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,860
Yes.

302
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,780
He is not around.

303
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,460
Is the place the club is now?

304
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,460
Not yet.

305
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
Let's just do the overtime.

306
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,080
There's a meeting.

307
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,740
It's a big help for us to come back to the living room.

308
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,620
You two

309
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,420
rank them

310
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,820
Have you given yourself a lesson?

311
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,220
I said I can't make money.

312
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,660
I have to think of a way to make money.

313
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,780
How is it?

314
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,900
I'll give you a discount.

315
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,420
Remember.

316
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,100
Then...

317
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,180
I'll leave.

318
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,020
How much?

319
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,060
99 yuan.

320
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,900
That's a big deal.

321
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,460
I'll think about it.

322
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,340
That's settled.

323
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,500
The location of the four states is reserved.

324
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,020
Actually, when I first went to your place,

325
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,060
I found it for a long time.

326
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,420
I only found the sign at home after a long time.

327
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,180
Just outside.

328
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,860
I didn't think of anything.

329
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,980
What do you mean?

330
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,540
It's just a sign.

331
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,940
And it's not like a restaurant.

332
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,100
It's like a hotel.

333
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,500
Of course.

334
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,140
It's my personal idea.

335
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,180
You don't have to care about it.

336
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,860
Since it's so obvious and so bad,

337
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,700
why did you turn off the light?

338
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,220
Wei Ji,

339
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,540
I have a special gift for you.

340
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,860
A homeå unseen bell.

341
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,540
A sign?

342
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,780
A l Id.

343
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,980
Yes, I will consider it during your opinion.

344
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,300
But I disagree.

345
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,300
Lu Si.

346
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I must tell him that he is a murderer.

347
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
I must tell him that he is a murderer.

348
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
I must tell him that he is a murderer.

349
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
It's been a long time.

350
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
This is also a murderer.

351
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
He took all my savings.

352
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
I spent two years of money.

353
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
What are you anxious about?

354
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,420
I spent 50,000 yuan.

355
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
You look not so good recently.

356
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,420
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

357
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
Thank you, Brother Zhang.

358
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,420
You're welcome.

359
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
Little thing.

360
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
Eat something.

361
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
I'll take care of it.

362
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Isn't it necessary to eat something?

363
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
I made the right decision.

364
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Eat.

365
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,420
Thank you.

366
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
This soft-shelled egg

367
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
is a piece of meat.

368
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I'll teach you.

369
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
What are you doing?

370
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
What are you doing?

371
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm sorry.

373
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
I'll go find someone to clean up.

374
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Who is it?

375
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Who doesn't know who it is?

376
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,420
It's okay.

377
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Xiaowan, you've read the newspaper today.

378
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
You didn't kill Gao Zi.

379
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,420
Sorry, Director.

380
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
I'll try my best.

381
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
It's actually very simple.

382
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,420
I know where the problem is.

383
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
I know.

384
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
But I can't do it.

385
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
Let's go.

386
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
And Qin Li.

387
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
Don't move your mobile again.

388
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
Yifan.

389
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Why are you here alone?

390
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Are you okay?

391
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
You won Pan Yuan who blamed you for others

392
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
may die.

393
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Or you heard?

394
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I did.

395
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Nowadays, the news star system

396
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,420
is spreading ausge.

397
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
During the Party Council met

398
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
you, a large wife was opened

399
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
by the leader

400
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
and the local bar company stopped you.

401
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
It was so hard to survive

402
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
andcue you.

403
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
The tydate makes me look down.

404
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
They've stopped me.

405
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,380
Pretty girls will have this kind of trouble.

406
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,300
I said it's definitely fake.

407
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,700
You should explain it to them as soon as possible.

408
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,100
If you explain it, will anyone listen?

409
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,580
Wulijing, look at how I clean up your face today.

410
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,180
Get away!

411
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,220
You're Wen Yifan, right?

412
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,020
Wulijing, you just sent a message to clean up my wife, right?

413
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,500
Don't look at me!

414
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,020
Don't look at me!

415
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,060
What are you doing with your phone?

416
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,820
I'm telling you, I can't believe you today.

417
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,660
Look carefully.

418
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,900
Your wife keeps sending me messages.

419
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,100
I've never been able to get a message.

420
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm telling you, don't be ridiculous!

421
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,060
How could she do this to you?

422
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,260
You're so ungrateful!

423
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,620
Get away from her!

424
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,260
You're definitely the one who caused the mistake.

425
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,780
You're being scolded for being a victim.

426
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:32,500
You're really a victim.

427
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,020
I really believe that

428
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,420
those words were sent by her.

429
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,660
I'll write a report to the president

430
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,180
and the committee of the supervision committee.

431
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,780
I don't know what the result will be.

432
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,660
Why?

433
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,220
She must have her own way.

434
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
It's not the first time after all.

435
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,220
But if you don't say it,

436
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
they'll think you're a criminal.

437
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,500
Whether I'm a criminal or not,

438
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,500
they'll only believe in what they believe.

439
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,220
The way you're talking is like a wound.

440
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,180
As long as you're against her,

441
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
you won't be hurt.

442
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,780
Don't worry about me.

443
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,740
I'm fine.

444
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,740
What time is it now?

445
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,740
It's almost 3 o'clock.

446
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,140
I'll go out to have a look.

447
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,740
We'll start now, Mr. Zheng.

448
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,940
Can you tell us

449
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,100
what happened at that time?

450
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,900
My daughter was in school that night.

451
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
We wanted to have a meal.

452
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
She had three men in the group.

453
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,700
She drank too much.

454
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
My daughter is only 16 years old.

455
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,700
She's not even a child.

456
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
They had to come over to get a car.

457
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,020
I was only one year old at that time.

458
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,300
I was so touched that my daughter had a finger.

459
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,100
I told her...

460
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,300
Dad.

461
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,180
Are you okay?

462
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,500
Be careful.

463
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,060
I'm fine.

464
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,500
Dad, are you okay?

465
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,100
It's all because of me.

466
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,420
I'm afraid I'm in trouble.

467
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,860
Dad, what's the problem?

468
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,060
If you're going to protect me,

469
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,060
I'll hurt you.

470
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
It's all because of me.

471
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,340
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,340
It's not your fault.

473
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,260
Hurry up.

474
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
She was 16 years old.

475
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
She met a family member like this.

476
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
She's a bad girl.

477
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,060
But I caught her behind my back.

478
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,060
She cried so hard.

479
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
Wei Zan.

480
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,860
It's really you.

481
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Why are you so hungry?

482
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,860
I'm going back to Nan Wu.

483
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,580
I'll go first.

484
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,460
No need.

485
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,260
We still have things to do.

486
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,860
Let's contact later.

487
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,420
Who is it?

488
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,260
Who wants to talk to you?

489
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
I'm not going back to the car.

490
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,460
You guys talk.

491
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,860
Thank you.

492
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
Why are you back?

493
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
Can't you come back?

494
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
It's not like that.

495
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't worry.

496
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,900
I won't go to your house to stay in Nan Wu.

497
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,340
We haven't seen each other today.

498
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,340
If you don't say it, no one will know.

499
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
I didn't say I won't let you go home.

500
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,540
You didn't say it.

501
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
Why are you so angry?

502
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,580
Okay.

503
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,940
I was wrong.

504
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,460
I was still young.

505
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I don't know how to make you leave my house.

506
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,260
Okay.

507
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
I don't want to help you.

508
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
I don't need to help you.

509
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,500
It's a good thing.

510
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Go check your medical record.

511
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,900
Then you're going to go home?

512
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm going to work overtime.

513
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
Okay. Let's go home.

514
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,660
No need.

515
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
I just want to live my own life.

516
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,660
You...

517
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,900
I'm not going back to Nan Wu for anyone.

518
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,100
I'm not going to stay at your house because I'm not afraid of you.

519
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,900
I've made any decision for myself.

520
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
I really have to go.

521
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
I'm not going to stay here.

522
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
I don't want to go home.

523
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
I'm not going to stay here.

524
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
Dad, Dad, Dad.

525
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Look, it's snowing outside.

526
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,300
It's snowing.

527
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,900
Nice.

528
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,700
Nice.

529
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,580
It looks nice.

530
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,900
It looks nice.

531
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,700
Are you happy?

532
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,500
Yes.

533
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,300
I'm happy.

534
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,900
Let's go snowing.

535
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,900
It's snowing.

536
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
It's snowing.

537
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I want to know what my little girl is doing.

538
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
I don't know.

539
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Because you are in the double-jump.

540
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,900
The day this season comes out.

541
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
What is double-jump?

542
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Double-jump is when the year of the dragon was at the end of September.

543
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,900
When the sun rises, it will go to a place where the sun rises.

544
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
It's the night and day in a year.

545
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,900
The sky is always at the end of the window.

546
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,900
So the night of double-jump is very cold.

547
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,900
But I'm afraid.

548
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,900
I'm not afraid. I have a father.

549
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
And when the dragon is at the end of September, he will come to find his father.

550
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
I will hold you tight.

551
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,900
It's cold.

552
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:15,900
I will wait for you to be careful.

553
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Hey, Wei Yifan.

554
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,900
I have a problem with this person.

555
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,900
Only one?

556
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,900
My safety is very strong.

557
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,900
If I don't lock the door before I sleep, I can't sleep.

558
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,900
I lock the door habit.

559
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,900
You can sleep if you are free.

560
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
I will lock the door if I come back late.

561
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,900
I mean sleep.

562
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
I remember we...

563
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,900
I told you clearly before we were working.

564
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I always work overtime.

565
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I will agree to you as a department head.

566
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Then please, if you come back after 10 o'clock,

567
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
tell me in advance.

568
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,900
Why?

569
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
Respect between the dead.

570
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
If you can't get back,

571
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,900
I will hide in the safe and the fear.

572
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I will do the same.

573
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I will tell you next time.

574
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Can I go to rest?

575
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
Who is he?

576
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
I will tell you.

577
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Hello, my name is Duan Jiaxu.

578
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I heard from No.4.

579
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,900
I haven't taught my girlfriend in Sang Yan University for 4 years.

580
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,900
I always hang out with a school girl named Duan Jiaxu.

581
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Duan Jiaxu.

582
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
I am a big sister.

583
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
I have a problem with this person.

584
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,900
My safety is stronger than someone else.

585
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,900
I remember we have contract.

586
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
I can't remember.

587
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,900
I will bring my friend home and remind him.

588
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Okay, I will remember.

589
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,900
I am sorry.

590
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Forget it.

591
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
We need to get along with the group.

592
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,900
We can understand some mistakes.

593
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,900
I will forgive you this time.

594
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
You can go.

595
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,900
I told you to leave early.

596
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
I can't clean clothes.

597
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Where are we going this weekend?

598
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
To work overtime.

599
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Sang Yan's shop.

600
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Sang Yan's shop?

601
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
You have contact?

602
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
I met him recently.

603
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,900
I have something to tell you.

604
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,900
I told you I have a roommate.

605
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,900
That roommate is Sang Yan.

606
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,900
He told me to go there.

607
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
He gave us a discount.

608
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
You have a contract with Sang Yan?

609
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
And how many discount?

610
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Let's talk about it later.

611
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
I have to do it later.

612
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
I will leave now.

613
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
You haven't said how many discount.

614
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
I will leave.

615
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
99 discount.

616
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
99...

617
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
I will leave now. Bye.

618
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I didn't hear it wrong.

619
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
99 discount is not discount.

620
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
It's a little discount.

621
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
We have chosen this place.

622
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,900
It's hard to think of it.

623
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
You can think of it.

624
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,900
I will break his head when we meet.

625
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Let's see what you think.

626
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
I have a contract with Sang Yan.

627
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I can't understand it.

628
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
It's late.

629
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Go to sleep.

630
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Good night.

631
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
Good night.

632
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Good night.

633
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
Hello?

634
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
Miss Wen, are you ready?

635
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
We are here.

636
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
We are here?

637
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
Wait for me.

638
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,900
The car is not in the way.

639
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I will listen to the news.

640
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,900
Okay.

641
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,900
I just washed my clothes.

642
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,900
I will come out after the light.

643
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
It's okay.

644
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
You can come slowly.

645
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Who said it's not urgent?

646
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,900
I am starving.

647
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
Wen Nian, hurry up.

648
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
I will save your life.

649
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
Well...

650
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Have you left the location for us?

651
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
We will go to dinner first.

652
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
We will arrive at home at 8 o'clock.

653
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
You are leaving too?

654
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
When will you change your clothes?

655
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,900
Are you going to the car park?

656
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,900
It's not the end yet.

657
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
It's the first floor.

658
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Let's go.

659
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Nian Nian.

660
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Nian Nian.

661
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Long time no see.

662
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Long time no see.

663
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
Why are you so shy?

664
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Our men's dance is finally gathered.

665
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
We will be on the same page.

666
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Who is this?

667
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Is this your boyfriend?

668
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,900
What boyfriend?

669
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
This is a man.

670
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
I remember.

671
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
It's 15,000 yuan.

672
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,900
Nian Nian.

673
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
Sang Nian.

674
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Long time no see.

675
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Didn't you say you can eat?

676
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I can.

677
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
I can.

678
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
Where are you going?

679
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,900
It's okay.

680
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
We can just find a place to eat.

681
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Aren't we ready?

682
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
You go.

683
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,900
It's been a long time since we last met.

684
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Let's have a talk.

685
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
We haven't met for a long time.

686
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Why are you so shy?

687
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
I don't know you.

688
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
You can go back if you don't know me.

689
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
Am I?

690
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Yes.

691
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,900
You mean we are together.

692
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
Is it convenient?

693
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
It's not convenient.

694
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I think it's convenient.

695
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Are you sure?

696
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
One of the men changes into someone else.

697
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,900
His future right is having a chat with me about this,

698
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
until he starts being unÑÐ´Ð° these days.

699
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,900
That's right.

700
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Starting a new life.

701
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Ready to meet.

702
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
Hello.

703
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
You have made a deal with Song Nian.

704
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Before I told you,

705
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
Qualified?!

706
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Li Yiming?

707
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,900
He is not yet married to her.

708
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Sell her a car.

709
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Her domestic tiger dog electronic plumper.

710
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Two hundred.

711
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,100
Yes, it's a very valuable thing.

712
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,740
What did you say?

713
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,020
We don't need to cover up

714
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,700
for the two of us to drink.

715
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,740
We can just squeeze it.

716
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,140
It's almost done.

717
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,580
Dad, you can sit down and rest.

718
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,180
Wait for me.

719
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,820
It's too long.

720
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,940
I feel uncomfortable sitting behind.

721
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,260
Go forward.

722
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,900
Okay.

723
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,140
It's okay.

724
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,020
I'll sit behind you.

725
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,180
Can I?

726
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,140
Sure. No problem.

727
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,300
Look at this!

728
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,180
Are you sure you are?

729
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,420
Can't you take a look?

730
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,460
Then look at me.

731
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,380
Are you the only one who looks aéª on that forehead?

732
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,080
Don't get me wrong.

733
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm as good as when I'm serious.

734
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Hot mover, then.

735
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,180
Don't get me wrong.

736
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,580
Don't put on a smile.

737
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,080
Boat- Panic!

738
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,580
Falling.

739
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,780
Those close friends are the best.

740
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,980
Don't say things like that.

741
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
There's no potential.

742
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,760
Your little uncle is taking that off- Afrasurgy!

743
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,300
What?

744
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,960
Hover your12- morning chain,

745
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,760
It's like there's nothing going on here.

746
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
No, no.

747
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,760
It's just a good picture.

748
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,960
You're so gossipy.

749
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm serious.

750
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,960
You're not Sang Yan.

751
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,760
Sang Yan is fighting over this.

752
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,560
I heard from Zhou Zhiming that

753
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,760
Wen Huaping doesn't like Sang Yan at all.

754
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
It's just that he's forced to be with him

755
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
because he doesn't want to be with him.

756
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,160
So he's even better.

757
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
He's about to kick his leg.

758
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,360
Who's better?

759
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,360
You need to move your head.

760
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Let's go.

761
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
Hey, don't talk.

762
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,360
You're so handsome.

763
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
This one?

764
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
What's this?

765
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,360
It's so worth it.

766
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
You're so handsome.

767
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,360
I thought you were pretty.

768
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
You're so handsome.

769
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
What's wrong with you?

770
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
You know what?

771
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
You're so hot-tempered.

772
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,360
What's the point of lying to me?

773
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
I'm sorry.

774
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm sorry.

775
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
I didn't apologize to you.

776
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Zhou Zhiming.

777
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
And I'm teaching you.

778
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm not talking.

779
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I was just kidding.

780
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,360
And I'm not talking to you alone.

781
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Kidding?

782
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
You're so handsome.

783
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
I'm not ashamed of you.

784
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
I'm just kidding.

785
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
The one who's going to be a bad-for-nothing

786
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
is the same as him.

787
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
I don't have any other choice.

788
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
I'm just trying to remember.

789
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Let's talk.

790
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
I can talk.

791
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
No!

792
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
I mean it.

793
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
I'm sorry.

794
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
It's me.

795
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
I told them you kicked his leg.

796
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
But I have no evidence.

797
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
I'm a blind girl.

798
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
I'll never say it again.

799
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Are you okay?

800
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Let go.

801
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,900
You...

802
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,040
You're asking me now?

803
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,720
He's my grief.

804
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,420
How about me?

805
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,800
I'm not a joint earner.

806
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,120
Sang Yan...

807
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,080
Sorry.

808
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,200
What for?

809
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,360
The other party can only be controlled by the soul.

810
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
Dong.

811
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
Dong, make a big deal.

812
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Dong.

813
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Thank you.

814
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Who is the guest in the village?

815
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Fang Yu is a very serious person.

816
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
He is very serious.

817
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,360
He is very serious when he talks.

818
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I'm fine.

819
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
I'm fine.

820
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
Look, he is serious.

821
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
I understand.

822
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
I didn't tell you about Fang Yu's admission.

823
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
I heard you were scared.

825
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
I will go to the top.

826
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
No need.

827
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
It has nothing to do with you.

828
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
Fang Yu.

829
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Fang Yu.

830
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Do you know that there is a store?

831
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I know.

832
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
So I decided to move out.

833
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
I'm sorry.

834
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Why are you still not leaving?

835
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
Classmate.

836
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
Classmate.

837
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
This time is our dance class.

838
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,360
I think there is still 10 minutes left.

839
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
He is a new student.

840
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
No matter what he says,

841
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
he can't dance.

842
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
What is he doing?

843
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
He is a new student.

844
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,360
He is a new student.

845
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,360
He is a new student.

846
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,360
He can't dance.

847
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
What is he doing?

848
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
He is a new student.

849
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,360
We decided to move out.

850
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
You can leave.

851
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
You can dance alone.

852
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
There is so much space.

853
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
No need.

854
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Didn't you say that there is still 10 minutes left?

855
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
And.

856
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Who said he is a new student?

857
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,360
He is a new student.

858
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Do you really think that you can do it?

859
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Someone can help you.

860
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
You can do it.

861
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,360
Who?

862
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,360
So good.

863
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,360
I am so happy to see you.

864
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
I am so happy to see you.

I am so happy to see you.

870
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
I am so happy to see you.

871
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360
I am so happy to see you.

872
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
I am so happy to see you.

873
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,360
I am so happy to see you.

874
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
I am so happy to see you.

875
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
I am so happy to see you.

876
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
I am so happy to see you.

877
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
I am so happy to see you.

878
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
I am so happy to see you.

879
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
I am so happy to see you.

880
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
I am so happy to see you.

881
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
I am so happy to see you.

882
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I am so happy to see you.

883
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
I am so happy to see you.

884
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,360
I am so happy to see you.

885
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,360
I am so happy to see you.

886
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,360
I am so happy to see you.

887
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,360
I am so happy to see you.

888
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
I am so happy to see you.

889
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,360
I am so happy to see you.
