1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
The world is full of people.

2
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,960
You are the star of the bed.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,440
The rain makes the wind blow.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe it's because of you.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
You are the star of the bed.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
I doubt that I am you.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,080
I am the earth for you.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,600
For you, I am the star of the bed.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,800
The world is watching me.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
What's the point of being left and right?

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,640
I want to understand everything and change my memory.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,200
All the storms and storms are the life.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
It's because of you.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
It's because of you.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,800
I am the star of the bed.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,200
The world is full of people.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Even if there is someone at the end, I will be there.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,200
I doubt that I am you.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,000
I am the earth for you.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,600
With you, with you.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,400
I have loved you before.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
I have been tested for the test this morning.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
I didn't expect so many tests.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,700
I want to visit my hometown.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,900
Thank you for helping me.

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,800
It's okay.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
By the way, Yifan, do you want to test?

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,800
We can study together.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,500
I have to work first after graduation.

30
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,900
I want to go back to my hometown.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,500
My boyfriend is waiting for me.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,700
You are the only one.

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Is there someone waiting for you?

34
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
I think that if I go back to my hometown,

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,100
I can teach and eat and drink with my parents.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,700
That's great.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,800
That's all.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,500
Master, please open the back door.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,700
Yifan, put it here.

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,900
I will go and call my master.

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Master, can you open the back door?

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,500
Thank you.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,500
So many things?

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Thank you, master.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Thank you, master.

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Thank you.

47
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,700
I have something to eat.

48
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I can eat when it's hot.

49
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,900
I left you a bowl of rice.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,900
I will remember to eat it.

51
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,900
When are you going home?

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
I will give you some rest.

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,900
I have to go to work tomorrow.

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Master, you are back.

55
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,900
Are you back?

56
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
I am back.

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,900
I am back.

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,900
I am back.

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
I am back.

60
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
I am back.

61
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Yifan, are you at home?

62
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
We are going to the third floor of the office.

63
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
We will pick you up.

64
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,780
Wow!

65
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,820
Raju and I need a dream to tell

66
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,660
you a secret.

67
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,940
Girl.

68
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,860
Who?

69
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,020
Shake hands.

70
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,820
ici

71
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,340
Yes?

72
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,300
Mom.

73
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,860
You come to?

74
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,820
Laohu.

75
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,740
Where?

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:13,940
Tianzan?

77
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,620
Have you delivered it?

78
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,500
I have to go to the loans now.

79
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,700
Twitter

80
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,820
music

81
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:45,780
Well.

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a Constasser family.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,140
He's exaggerating.

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,540
Midwife,

85
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
good to see you again.

86
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Don't come here again.

87
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
This is a big water-saving building.

88
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
I heard that this machine is going to explode.

89
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
The driver doesn't know what's going on.

90
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
He drove the car to the human hospital.

91
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Now the car is not in good condition.

92
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,660
I don't know if it's a joke or a news report.

93
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Don't joke.

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,660
You have to take a picture of the driver's face later.

95
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
But you have to see the victim's emotions.

96
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,660
If he doesn't want to take the picture, just try your best.

97
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,660
Okay.

98
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm hungry.

99
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
What's wrong?

100
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Wait here.

101
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
This way.

102
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Wait.

103
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Wait.

104
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Wait.

105
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Wait.

106
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
Wait.

107
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
Wait.

108
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
What are you doing?

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
There's a person.

110
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
There's a person inside.

111
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Wait.

112
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Wait.

113
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Wait.

114
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
The driver didn't answer the call.

115
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,660
The damaged damaged part of the driver's nose was estimated to be 14 million yuan.

116
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
The car cost was very high.

117
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,660
News from a TV station in the south of the village has reported that the driver's nose is a little fine.

118
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Okay.

119
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
I'll change it.

120
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Don't come here.

121
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Don't come here.

122
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Don't come here.

123
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Don't come here.

124
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Don't come here.

125
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Don't come here.

126
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Don't come here.

127
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Did he see me?

128
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,660
Sorry, I just wanted to cut it off.

129
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
The creditors didn't answer.

130
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,660
The damage caused by the man's death

131
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,660
was estimated to be 14 million yuan.

132
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,660
The price of the car was very low.

133
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,660
The new staff from the South House TV station

134
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
and the report from the South House TV station.

135
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Why haven't you slept yet?

136
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,660
Isn't it Saturday today?

137
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,660
I'm going to sleep.

138
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,660
But you

139
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
have to sleep after you finish.

140
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
What's wrong?

141
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Something bad?

142
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm tired. I want to move.

143
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,660
You're not tired after you've been carrying the car like this?

144
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
Have you finished your porridge?

145
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
You'll be done in a minute.

146
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
You can carry the water

147
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
and the water later.

148
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Okay?

149
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Come on.

150
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Sang Yan.

151
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
I won't be like before.

152
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
I won't.

153
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
I'll be nice to you.

154
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,660
I won't hurt you anymore.

155
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,660
I want to be with you every day.

156
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
I don't want to see the old people again.

157
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
I don't want to see anyone.

158
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,660
So can we be like this now?

159
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,660
Can we be like this forever?

160
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
When you want to talk,

161
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
just call me.

162
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I want to kiss you.

163
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
I'm going to rest.

164
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
Go to bed.

165
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Let me see.

166
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Is this a kiss?

167
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
This is not the first time.

168
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
So...

169
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm not happy anymore, right?

170
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
What's wrong with me?

171
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Sister-in-law Li hugged you and hugged you.

172
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
You're not happy to kiss.

173
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
You're a double-edged sword.

174
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
If you want to kiss,

175
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,660
can you be serious?

176
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Why are you so serious?

177
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm serious.

178
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Look at me carefully.

179
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Talk to me more closely.

180
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
Then what?

181
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I'm going to go to bed.

182
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
What's wrong?

183
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
What's wrong?

184
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
Why are you hiding?

185
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
I'm a little shy.

186
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
I'm hungry.

187
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
What?

188
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,660
I can't do anything at the same time.

189
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Are you going to drink porridge

190
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
or

191
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
let me kiss you for a while?

192
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
Let's drink porridge first.

193
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Let's drink porridge first.

194
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
Go to bed after eating.

195
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
Don't you have to go to work later?

196
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Yes.

197
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
You still want to continue?

198
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
You're so bad at kissing.

199
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
You're the best.

200
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Then I'll...

201
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
Let's practice.

202
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Didn'tõesi

203
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,660
Originally, Xiao Xiao is

204
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,660
the little Nazes in your house.

205
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Don't you still think

206
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
where you spent your money

207
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,660
for the past six months?

208
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,620
Are you the A кр seinem

209
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,420
He didn't have money to study in Nanwu

210
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,020
and pursue his dream.

211
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,420
So he spent money to buy the old house.

212
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,220
He even found the old furniture in the old house.

213
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
He re-purchased the old house.

214
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,420
But where is my copy of the memory?

215
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,420
It must be the hope of staying with grandma.

216
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,020
That place gave them the best memory.

217
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,220
He wanted to keep the memory when he had money.

218
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,220
He was thinking about something.

219
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,220
He was old and he had some weird ideas.

220
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,020
Su Hao, you really want to do this?

221
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,820
No, he already made grandma misunderstand. He didn't even tell her.

222
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,620
Some things can be solved by saying it.

223
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
I don't think you care about him.

224
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,020
It's not that I care.

225
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Actually, these years, I think our family has always had a wound.

226
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,020
No one dares to kick or touch it.

227
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,220
Do you know that it's possible that grandpa doesn't want to say he's sick?

228
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,220
He even pushed grandma out of the caravan for a reason.

229
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
There are only three of you left.

230
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,620
But no one wants to talk about it for the past.

231
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,220
What about your future?

232
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Grandpa came to your house that day. He asked me which side I slept on.

233
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Left or right?

234
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Right.

235
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Do you know that grandpa always sleeps on the left when he's at home?

236
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,220
And grandma's room is always on the right.

237
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,220
When grandma's not at home,

238
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,220
I always clean and clean the room every day.

239
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,220
Then I sat here and listened to my brother.

240
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,220
I saw a lot of old photos and memories.

241
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,220
I would take them out and quickly send them down.

242
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,220
When I send them down, I would go to my hometown to make up for it.

243
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Are you looking forward to the last grandma?

244
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,220
I'm in your health now.

245
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
You should go.

246
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,220
I was busy with my work for years.

247
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
I didn't have time to spend time with her.

248
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:44,220
After she retired, she would stay at home every day.

249
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,220
And she would take all the happiness of her family

250
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,220
from the caravan.

251
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Why don't you go with grandma?

252
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
You two will be happier.

253
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,220
I also want to.

254
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,220
But I can't stay with her.

255
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,220
I always feel that she is a loss.

256
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,220
So I made a big scene with her.

257
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:25,220
She can travel alone without me.

258
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,220
They must be very unfamiliar with each other.

259
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
They are just in the city.

260
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,220
You are young and should not be afraid of the injuries.

261
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
But they are out there.

262
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,220
I don't have the time to mention them.

263
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,220
I will be the first person to answer your question.

264
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,220
What about you?

265
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,220
Did anyone listen to you?

266
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
You are sitting here.

267
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,220
You will avoid the place when you are stressed.

268
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,220
So you don't have the time to talk to me.

269
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
I will be the only one.

270
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
Zhong Siqiao.

271
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
I helped you a lot.

272
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
I helped you to be a good husband.

273
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
I helped you to be a good family.

274
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
I helped you to be a good person.

275
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
What about you?

276
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Can I help you?

277
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,220
Don't laugh.

278
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Don't force your smile.

279
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
I have learned this from you.

280
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,220
Don't laugh when you don't want to laugh.

281
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
I am not as strong as you are.

282
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,220
But I know how to be fragile.

283
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
You are working hard.

284
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,220
I just love them.

285
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,220
I don't want them to be separated.

286
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
I don't want to see my brother die.

287
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
I don't want to see my grandma be sick.

288
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
No one will take care of her.

289
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
I don't want to see my grandma die.

290
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
No one will take care of her.

291
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
I don't want to think

292
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,220
and be sad about anything.

293
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
I know you like them.

294
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,220
I am not stupid.

295
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
But I don't want to be a good husband.

296
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
I helped you.

297
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,220
You are a good husband.

298
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Maybe we can try.

299
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
I don't want to do it.

300
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
So have you thought about me these days?

301
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
I have.

302
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,220
But I'm very angry. You haven't been in touch for half a month.

303
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
I don't want you to know that I miss you.

304
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,220
I...

305
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
I don't seem to be that good.

306
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
I...

307
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
I'm fine.

308
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
That's because you're so rich.

309
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,220
You...

310
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,220
I'm different from all the other relationships, okay?

311
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Don't get me wrong. I haven't promised to date you.

312
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Are you willing to date me?

313
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
I'll think about it.

314
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,220
This time, you said that you're like a scumbag.

315
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
You're the one who kissed me.

316
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
You're even more angry.

317
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,220
That's because you're so old.

318
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Okay.

319
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,220
You're not coming out.

320
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
I'll chase you from now on.

321
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
We'll come back soon.

322
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Okay?

323
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Su Hao, calm down.

324
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
Sit down.

325
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
You're chasing me.

326
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,220
Let me be the one who's chasing you.

327
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Let me die.

328
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
Okay.

329
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,220
You're so bad at writing.

330
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Xiu Qi.

331
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
What's the matter?

332
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
The woman..

333
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,220
HerBat mec...

334
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,140
Help yourself.

335
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,740
Chen.

336
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,940
She is on your side.

337
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,500
Go to see sugar魔on.

338
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,140
What's wrong?

339
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,500
Why are not you going to bed?

340
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,860
You took him out sometime ago?

341
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,780
Yes.

342
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,380
She changed my notes for him.

343
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,860
She came to fetch him.

344
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,900
Why didn't you make her a few minutes to take a rest?

345
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,180
All quiet.

346
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,820
Here.

347
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,180
How is it?

348
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,100
Is it cool?

349
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,980
Yes.

350
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,780
It's nice.

351
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
When I was in college,

352
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
I was still a little bit nervous.

353
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,060
Qian Fei.

354
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,500
Yes.

355
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,660
By the way,

356
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,540
is it time for you to get married

357
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,340
after you get married?

358
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,860
I'm not sure yet.

359
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,940
What's wrong?

360
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,300
Nothing.

361
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,820
I'm just asking.

362
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,140
Is this Deng Xiaoxu?

363
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,060
Yes.

364
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,180
It's pretty cool.

365
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,540
But there's no change.

366
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,860
Is it cool?

367
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,700
It's a good thing.

368
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,820
It looks a little dull.

369
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,900
No.

370
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,140
It's the heart of the grass.

371
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,380
Many girls like it.

372
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,700
I heard that

373
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,420
you two are male and female.

374
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,060
Why didn't I hear about it?

375
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,060
Well,

376
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,420
you think she's...

377
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,980
She's...

378
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,580
She's a young girl.

379
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,620
What kind of girl is she?

380
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,100
She looks like a young girl

381
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
with a bright face.

382
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,540
She's quite attractive

383
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,700
in the human world.

384
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,660
Maybe...

385
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Maybe because of this photo,

386
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,380
you don't have me.

387
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,740
Isn't that your mom?

388
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
She just...

389
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,220
She just looks at the stars.

390
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,380
She actually looks pretty big.

391
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,180
She's bigger than us.

392
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
She's a little bit smaller.

393
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,220
Is it too exaggerated?

394
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,260
No.

395
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,100
She really looks big.

396
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,060
I didn't notice that

397
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,180
you guys are so big.

398
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,860
Are you sleepy?

399
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,300
I'm still sleepy.

400
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,740
Well...

401
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm sleepy.

402
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,180
I think I should go to bed.

403
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:15,820
I...

404
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,940
I haven't finished reading it.

405
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,460
I'll change my face.

406
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,740
I'll change my face.

407
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,340
I'll sleep.

408
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,620
Okay.

409
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,420
No one's here.

410
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
You're so serious.

411
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,220
You don't have to knock.

412
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,300
You can just come in.

413
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,660
Are you afraid

414
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,260
you'll be dressed up?

415
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,220
What if I do?

416
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,300
This is for you.

417
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,660
What is this?

418
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,300
It's a gift for Qianren.

419
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,580
I think

420
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,900
others usually

421
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,820
eat and drink at night.

422
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,740
I don't want to do that.

423
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,220
Because...

424
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,100
you're special.

425
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,660
Can you open it?

426
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,180
Yes.

427
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,580
Ten-need Chairman newly founded.

428
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,220
What do you want

429
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,380
to give me

430
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,100
the little girls' things?

431
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,620
You aren't like the little girls anymore.

432
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,420
What do you mean by that?

433
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,020
It means

434
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:03,940
come.

435
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,860
I'm trying it on for you.

436
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,740
Okay.

437
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,780
Take it.

438
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
What's this?

439
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,780
This is mine.

440
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,780
Okay.

441
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Sang Yan.

442
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,780
It's Hanmitian.

443
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,780
An intimate body and financial aid are provided by ladies.

444
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,780
An intimate body and financial aid are provided by women.

445
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Our men can handle this.

446
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,780
Situ Yu,

447
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,280
are you married or not?

448
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,840
I have a gift.

449
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,800
We've made it on our first weekend.

450
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,360
This one?

451
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,040
Should I open it?

452
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,060
Of course.

453
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,240
What is it?

454
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
I thought you said you liked the recording.

455
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
But I don't know how to use it.

456
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Do I need to plug in the computer and listen to it?

457
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
No need.

458
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
You can use this.

459
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
You can use it.

460
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Why?

461
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Anyway, you can try it.

462
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
If you have any questions, you can change it.

463
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Okay.

464
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:27,880
Zi

465
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,240
Help her look for her father in village hurtk

466
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,560
That will be dangerous

467
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,200
Go

468
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,360
I'll tell you

469
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,860
Tell you

470
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
You deserve the best

471
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,280
Remember to let me

472
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,480
People are heading your house

473
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
No matter what happens

474
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
I will be by your side

475
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
Here it is.

476
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,880
I spent most of my time

477
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
walking around the world.

478
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
I was so busy.

479
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I was so busy.

480
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
I was so busy.

481
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
I was so busy.

482
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
I didn't know

483
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
how to make it.

484
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Your grandma

485
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
is always a very strong and living-life-lover.

486
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
She was not so rich in the past.

487
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,880
But her spirit is full of life.

488
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
She likes to climb the mountain.

489
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
So I bought a lot of climbing equipment here.

490
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
She likes to play with flowers.

491
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I was fine.

492
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
I came up here to buy some flowers.

493
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
And

494
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
she had a coffee shop.

495
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Now I also learn to make coffee by hand.

496
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,880
No wonder she always asked me to bring her here.

497
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
She didn't even let me come up to the door.

498
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,880
So this is her garden.

499
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
I was afraid I would forget.

500
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
So

501
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
I collected the old memories

502
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
here.

503
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
I collected them one by one.

504
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Even the sofa and the chair

505
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,880
are very similar to what we used to use.

506
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Xiaoxiao, you are back.

507
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

508
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
I didn't agree to it.

509
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,880
I just told your grandma.

510
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,880
It's my fault, grandpa.

511
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
I think grandma has the right to know.

512
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
If you don't tell grandma,

513
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
she will be very sad.

514
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
Let me ask you.

515
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Why didn't you tell me when you were sick?

516
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I think you are so innocent.

517
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
You should go on a trip.

518
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Don't you have a dream

519
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,880
because of me?

520
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
If you don't have a dream,

521
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
what else does it mean?

522
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,880
If you didn't want to fight with me

523
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
and make me angry,

524
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,880
how could I leave you alone on a trip?

525
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,880
That's because I'm sick.

526
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,880
I forget things often.

527
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm so angry.

528
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm worried that my illness

529
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
will get worse.

530
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
In the end,

531
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
even the people around me

532
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
forget everything.

533
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Don't be afraid.

534
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,880
We will be old and forget everything.

535
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,880
But some things will not change.

536
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
We are husband and wife.

537
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
We've been together for so long.

538
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Are you happy?

539
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,880
I hope you're happy.

540
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
When I went on a trip,

541
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,880
I thought I would be happy.

542
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,880
But I'm not happy.

543
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,880
I'm always worried about my family.

544
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm worried about you.

545
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
When I was dying,

546
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
the old horse sent me a message.

547
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I really wanted to come back soon.

548
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,880
I found out that you are my biggest happiness.

549
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Grandpa.

550
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Don't be so hardworking.

551
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
You can't remember anything.

552
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
Just remember it.

553
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
You said you don't remember anything.

554
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
I forget the sofa.

555
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
But you remember all the clothes

556
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,880
and the colour of the chairs.

557
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,880
I'm not that good.

558
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
I took my old photos

559
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
and went to look for them.

560
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,880
I've looked for the cloth.

561
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I've found it for a long time.

562
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,880
I'm back.

563
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Really?

564
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Welcome back.

565
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,880
We've been dancing for so long.

566
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Right.

567
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I thought you didn't remember.

568
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
I'm back.

569
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
I've never seen

570
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
the past.

571
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
I've never seen

572
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
the past.

573
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
I feel that

574
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
I've never been

575
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,880
captured by a certain emotion.

576
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Yes.

577
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I regret it.

578
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
I regret it.

579
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
I've never met the time.

580
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
If I can,

581
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm willing to take part in every moment in his life.

582
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,880
I'll accompany him to every happy and sad moment.

583
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
I can be with him

584
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
whenever he's sad.

585
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
I'm willing to be your charging bag.

586
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
In the future,

587
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
I'll give you

588
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
full of energy.

589
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,880
What's your name?

590
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
I'm Zeng.

591
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
How are you?

592
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,880
I'm fine.

593
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
I'm like a rock.

594
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,880
What about you?

595
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
What?

596
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,880
I'm very good at singing.

597
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
If you don't say that

598
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm a rock,

599
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm not welcome.

600
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
What's wrong?

601
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I'm not in a good mood.

602
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm not in a good mood.

603
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I'm not in a good mood.

604
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Then

605
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I'll take my hand out.

606
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
What's wrong?

607
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
What's wrong?

608
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
What's wrong?

609
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
What's wrong?

610
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
What's wrong?

611
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Ok.

612
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I...

613
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,880
I'm telling you.

614
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Don't tell him.

615
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
You can call him now.

616
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Boss.

617
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
What's wrong with you?

618
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,080
Mr. Jotayang.

619
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
Huge event!

620
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,400
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,320
In the future,

622
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,080
be my nghĩer.

623
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,480
The warmth and warmth gave me a sense of luxury

624
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,080
You are the wind in the rain

625
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,480
You are the wind in the rain

626
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,080
You are the wind in the rain

627
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,080
You are the wind in the rain

628
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,680
You are the wind in the rain

629
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,280
You are the wind in the rain

630
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,080
When I have your voice

631
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I can show the darkness before my eyes

632
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,280
All thoughts and all memories are you

633
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,680
In our youth, every step is a miracle

634
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,280
Every moment is a encounter

635
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
The you that falls down and scatters

636
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,480
Is not a fixed rate

637
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,280
Every time I make a big news

638
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
I want to tell you

639
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,880
We will make a complete journey together

640
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,680
I won't give up

641
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,880
I will be here with you

642
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,280
You are the wind in the rain

643
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,680
You are the wind in the rain

644
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,080
You are standing by me

645
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,480
You are standing by my side

646
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,080
This road is a long and difficult path

647
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,480
The full moon and the full moon

648
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,080
When I have your voice

649
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,480
I can give up

650
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,080
I won't give up

651
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,480
You give me courage

652
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,080
And the future I want

653
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,480
Is you like a wave

654
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Pretending to be every night

655
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,880
Even if it's a continuous journey

656
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,680
I won't be lonely anymore

657
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,080
I feel you exist

658
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:19,080
The darkness that can pass through my eyes
