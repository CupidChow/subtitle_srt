And

199
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,140
who said he was alone?

200
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,580
Is he your girlfriend?

201
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,060
No.

202
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,340
Why did you kick Chang Zidou

203
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,620
and fight for ten minutes?

204
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,180
Besides,

205
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,620
you're not a dancer.

206
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:08,980
You're right.

207
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I was a dancer when I was a kid.

208
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,500
But they didn't want me.

209
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,020
You like him, right?

210
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,420
The two of them are at school.

211
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,500
Don't be so close.

212
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,700
They are mistaken.

213
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
I can't let them see me again.

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,060
I'll be so sorry

215
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,980
if I see you again.

216
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,660
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

217
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,420
I can't believe you haven't drawn attention on me!

218
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,860
Who told you to do that!

219
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,180
What's up with you?

220
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,220
I let family fight.

221
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,980
Can you be all right with me?

222
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,620
Sure!

223
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,060
Of course.

224
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,380
eyesight...

225
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,740
Still keep chasing me?

226
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,540
I'm the celebrity at this age!

227
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,020
Give me some eggs, give me some ice on your mouth.

228
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,060
Can I have some eggs?

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,180
No, give me some.

230
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,100
Here.

231
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,380
It's time to wash it.

232
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,700
Onions.

233
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,260
You nice.

234
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,820
Hope everything goes well

235
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,620
To meet everyone

236
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,760
Theorman

237
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,240
A wonderful time

238
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
...

239
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,560
...

240
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,840
...

241
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,480
...

242
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,580
...

243
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,560
...

244
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,020
...

245
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,680
...

246
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,080
Am I also his拍mate?

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,900

248
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,260

00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,920
I love you

250
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,780
I love you

251
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,900
every minute I leave the messages

252
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,680
We will try да

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,100
You usually use the quarantine

254
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,760
So sleep, brother.

255
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,720
Always listening.

256
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,600
You always listen to Gundam's problem.

257
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,000
juk judge

258
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
Wait a minute and see if it's true

259
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm on my super�!

260
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,040
I can't seem to hook you up either.

261
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,940
No!

262
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,980
Give me a break!

263
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,660
Stop!

264
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,920
Brother

265
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,720
Get him out

266
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,060
Fresh

267
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,960
Bye

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Did you hear that?

269
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
What are you doing here?

270
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
There's no place to dance.

271
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
Let's just stay here and have a chat.

272
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Let's have a drink.

273
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Wait.

274
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
I'll get you a plane.

275
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
No matter what happens to you,

276
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I'll still be there for you.

277
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:57,480
真的很是大家喜

278
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,480
Enough.

279
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,780
Chris,

280
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,960
guess the board.

281
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

282
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,260
When did you change home, Xiao Feng?

283
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,660
Don't you sleep?

284
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,660
Good morning.

285
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,260
I will sit here.

286
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,380
Then aren't you my boyfriend?

287
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,380
I think I think I remember it wrongly.

288
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,380
I asked a very strange question.

289
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,380
Now I think as a teacher, I shouldn't be so gossipy.

290
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,380
What is it?

291
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
Aren't they both late together?

292
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
When I stood at the door, I asked them,

293
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,380
Are you two coming together?

294
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Yes, yes, yes.

295
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Then I remember that

296
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,380
I remember that

297
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
I remember that

298
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
I remember that

299
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
I remember that

300
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
I remember that

301
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
I remember that

302
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
I remember that

303
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I remember that

304
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
I remember that

305
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
I remember that

306
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
I remember that

307
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
I immediately denied it.

308
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,380
No, no, no.

309
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
But I think I was a bit

310
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,380
talkative at that time

311
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,380
or a little

312
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
a little bit of a sweet-talking question.

313
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
But I didn't think about it.

314
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
They were really together

315
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
so far away.

316
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
So,

317
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Little Yiyan's family is here.

318
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
The first time I saw her at school,

319
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
I thought

320
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,380
Wow, this girl is so beautiful.

321
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,380
If she said

322
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,380
Give me a daughter-in-law.

323
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,380
That's a wonderful thing.

324
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,380
When did you find out that they were together?

325
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Actually,

326
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,380
from the moment

327
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
the girl threw the medicine,

328
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
she secretly brought it to the box

329
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
and felt that

330
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
something was wrong.

331
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
How did you know that she was the one who brought it?

332
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380
I secretly saw it.

333
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Why did you come to work for the first time?

334
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
The first time I came to work

335
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
was to bring a little bit to see the boss.

336
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
Is she really the one who came to work?

337
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Well,

338
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,380
I don't know who she is.

339
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Then who is she?

340
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Who is she?

341
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Is she a concubine?

342
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
When did you find out that they were weird?

343
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,380
It should be a meal.

344
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
It was a long-term fever.

345
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,380
But I asked you about it.

346
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
But I didn't think about it.

347
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,380
I didn't think about it.

348
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,380
They were together at my wedding.

349
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,380
At that time,

350
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,380
I felt that

351
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
they were in a panic

352
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,380
when they were taken away by our table.

353
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Although they were angry,

354
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,380
they still wanted to wish them well.

355
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I hope they will be more and more useful.

356
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,380
We all care about

357
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
the story of Sang Yan and Wen Yi Fan.

358
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Because

359
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
fate is actually a very strange thing.

360
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
And I think that

361
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
when two people are together,

362
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
especially the one who loves each other,

363
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
there will be some

364
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
mistakes or tests.

365
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
There will be even big difficulties.

366
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,380
But the more tests we do,

367
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,380
the more we put in the back.

368
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
The sugar will melt.

369
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Wen Yi Fan disappeared.

370
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
In Hong Kong,

371
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,380
I felt that she was very confused.

372
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
She was always so calm,

373
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
so unbearable.

374
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,380
But in that period,

375
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,380
she seemed to be very obvious.

376
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I just told her on the surface

377
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
that she was fine.

378
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
I hope she is fine.

379
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I know that she was actually quite sad in her heart.

380
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
But in the end,

381
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
they still found each other.

382
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
When you were having dinner,

383
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I talked to Yi Fan

384
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,380
about the thing about the high school senior brother.

385
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
At that time, I was quite upset.

386
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
Because I saw

387
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,380
a very proud and open brother

388
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
being attacked at that time.

389
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,380
When he entered the world of human life,

390
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,380
he was very arrogant.

391
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
I feel that as a sister,

392
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,380
he was very sad.

393
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
He had a different look

394
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
for the human eyes.

395
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
When he saw Wen Yi Fan,

396
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,380
he was very upset.

397
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,380
He was very clear about the inner heart.

398
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
Obviously,

399
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,380
Wen Yi Fan is a foreign-born female.

400
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,380
And Sang Yan is a foreign-born female.

401
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,380
So they are quite compatible.

402
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,380
They are a good match.

403
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,380
Wen Yi Fan is getting married with Sang Yan.

404
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,380
Do you want to give them a blessing?

405
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,380
I hope

406
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
Sang Yan can

407
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,380
always be

408
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
a little bit dark.

409
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
Don't let him

410
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
feel sad in his heart.

411
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
I hope he can

412
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
always be

413
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,380
a real happy boy.

414
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
I believe that

415
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,380
we can always be

416
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,380
a good couple.

417
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
So that

418
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
we can be happy together.

419
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,380
I hope

420
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,380
they can have a long and healthy life.

421
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,380
Live a long life.

422
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
Live a long life.

423
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,380
I hope they can

424
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,380
have a good and healthy life.

425
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,380
A good and healthy marriage

426
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,380
is a very beautiful marriage.

427
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,380
You two

428
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
can be together.

429
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Of course,

430
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
you two can be happy.

431
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
And you have to be close.

432
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
You can be together.

433
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,380
Sang Yan can be a little bit more friendly.

434
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
Or I might be a little bit more aggressive.

435
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,380
I'll tell you.

436
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,380
If Wen Yi Fan is the only one

437
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,380
who has a good husband,

438
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
Sang Yan

439
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,380
will be the last one to be married.

440
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,380
I hope they

441
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
will never quarrel.

442
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
And they can

443
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
have a very good and happy life.

444
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Be happy and happy.

445
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
If Sang Yan is not good to Wen Yi Fan,

446
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
what will you do?

447
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,380
I will definitely let him go.

448
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
I will.

449
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,380
I will let him go.

450
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
I hope Sang Yan can

451
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,380
treat Wen Yi Fan well.

452
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,380
Wen Yi Fan will be

453
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,380
the best girl in his life.

454
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,380
How many children do you want to have in the future?

455
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Whatever.

456
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm very happy.

457
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
They can have a few children.

458
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Because they are getting married now.

459
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,380
They are finally getting married.

460
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
Do you have any feelings?

461
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,380
How many bags are suitable for me?

462
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
How long are you going to stay here?

463
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,380
No matter how long.

464
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
You are late.

465
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
Hello.

466
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,380
Hello.

467
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
This is dancing.

468
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
You are a little bit like

469
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
the dance you have been playing with me.

470
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
You are like the dance you have been playing with me.

471
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
You are always shining.

472
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,380
I also like you

473
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
to be my flight.

474
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
I want to

475
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
say that

476
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
I will always be there

477
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
for you.

478
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
I will always be there for you.

479
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,380
Okay.

480
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
Wen Shuang Qiao.

481
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
I will give you a pet.

482
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
I will always be there for you.

483
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
Here.

484
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
You gave me a pet.

485
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,380
I will give it to him here.

486
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Come.

487
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
Ke'ai.

488
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
Don't be nervous.

489
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
No phone.

490
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
No matter how long.

491
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
Come on.

492
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Wen Shuang Qiao.

493
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
I will give you a success.

494
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
After being with me,

495
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
all your wishes

496
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
will come true.

497
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,380
Wen Shuang Qiao.

498
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,380
Do you know what I want to say?

499
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,380
I...

500
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Marry me?

501
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
I...

502
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,380
Thank you.

503
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
I...

504
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
I will always be there for you.

505
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,380
I only knew that

506
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,380
the ring that Sang Yan stole

507
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
was a broken ring.

508
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,380
He said

509
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,940
because we are the most precious

510
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,780
gifts from each other.

511
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,380
As you were old,

512
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
your hair was tucked.

513
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,780
Youids and a citizenship,

514
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
giving him a bouquet of heck.

515
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
urger in the sum of your physical services.

516
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,460
You had your eyes

517
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,380
on the �酸'saa dream from that time.

518
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,380
You also withered

519
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
and got completely emotional.

520
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I once loved you more than the great and elegant past.

521
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,380
I also loved your mistakes and your true beauty.

522
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Only a man once looked at your heart and loved you more than anyone else.

523
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Please spend the rest of your life with me.

524
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,380
Before the moon, the moon is beautiful.

525
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,380
It's a sad and sad song.

526
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
It's a love song.

527
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,380
Then the moon and the mountain head,

528
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
between the stars,

529
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
and the moon,

530
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
hide the glory.

531
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Until the end of time,

532
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,380
love will be as strong as death.

533
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,380
The moon is always standing on my side.

534
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Are you okay?

536
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
What are you looking at?

537
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
You're so focused.

538
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Are you that curious?

539
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,380
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,380
Wait for the sun and the moon together.

541
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,380
The sun is shining.

542
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
The warmth is warm and cruel.

543
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,380
It gives me a good feeling.

544
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,380
You are in the wind.

545
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,380
You don't want me to come.

546
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,380
You are always standing on my side.

547
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,380
For my talent,

548
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,380
I can't stop this journey.

549
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,380
The rain is full of the ground.

550
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,380
But I have you.

551
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,380
I can show the darkness before my eyes.

552
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,380
All the thoughts and memories are you.

553
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,380
You are in every corner of our youth.

554
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
Every moment is a dream.

555
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,380
You are the one I want to be.

556
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
I will never give up.

557
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,380
Every time I bring you a big news,

558
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
I want to tell you.

559
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,380
We will make this journey together.

560
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
I won't give up.

561
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,380
I will be here with you.

562
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,380
You are in the wind.

563
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,380
You don't want me to come.

564
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,380
You are always standing on my side.

565
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,380
For my talent,

566
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,380
I can't stop this journey.

567
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,380
The rain is full of the ground.

568
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,380
But I have you.

569
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,380
I can show the darkness before my eyes.

570
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,380
You are in every corner of our youth.

571
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,380
You and I, the future.

572
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,380
You are the one I want to be.

573
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,380
I will show the darkness every moment.

574
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,380
Even if it's a single-eyed love,

575
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,380
I will be waiting alone.

576
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,380
Waiting for you to be there.

577
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I can show the darkness before my eyes.

578
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,380
You and I, the future.
