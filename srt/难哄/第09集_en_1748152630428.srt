1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
The world is full of people, you are the one who is alone

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate makes us meet

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,800
Maybe it's because of you, I'm careful

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,800
You are the one who is willing to be my friend

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,400
I've decided to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I've always understood, I've always changed my memory

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
All the storms and storms are because of the storm

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
It's because of you, I'm willing to be your friend

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Even if there is someone at the end, I will be there

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not good, I'm just a man, I'm afraid of you

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm holding you, holding you

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,800
I've loved you before

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Think about it

16
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,900
Under peutsen器's friendship, what time hasn't the wind hasn't woken up anymore?

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Let's go watch a movie.

18
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,600
You're not going to study today?

19
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I don't want you to come to the North Sea to see me every time you come back.

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
You should rest if you should.

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
How about this?

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
You like to play the horror movie?

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I can pick it up.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
Is that okay?

25
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Yes.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Hello, I want two dream stars and ten ghosts.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Later, I never went to school.

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I didn't even close the door.

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Except you, no one understands me.

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
No one talks to me.

31
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Okay, or no one will see me

32
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
even when someone gets outside the door.

33
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Just think about that.

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
Hi.

35
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Hi.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Do you think I look biomedical?

37
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
You must feel scared.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,920
Let me check.

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,120
Smell good.

40
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,420
Do you know if you have somearache?

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,980
Who dosne't drink?

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,520
Not me.

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,340
Okay.

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,520
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520

57
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520

64
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520

72
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520

73
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
Third Brother.

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Let him go.

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Let him go.

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
T Third Brother.

79
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Let her go.

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
T For the Music?

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Help her.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
This will be a great round of applause.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
What's the matter?

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm the one who met Yongwei.

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I know.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,760
I'm saying you're dressed like this.

87
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
What are you doing on the street?

88
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
We're going to a theater in our university

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,200
to play the story of a zookeeper in a theater.

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,960
I'm playing a romantic character in there.

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,480
So I really want to experience

92
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,000
how romantic characters live.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,520
Experience life?

94
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Have you been living so comfortably?

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,320
Officer, you don't know that.

96
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
Experience life is very important to actors.

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Hello, Yifan.

98
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Where's the student who's been

99
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
the best at acting?

100
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,040
You're really my lucky star.

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,200
Hello, we're the reporters

102
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,880
of the TV and TV channel

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,120
of the South House.

104
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,880
Can we have a interview with you?

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,840
Yes.

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,040
Thank you.

107
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,040
Let's go outside.

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,160
Okay.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,720
Okay.

110
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
I'll go first.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
Are you okay?

112
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm fine.

113
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
Is there anyone in the street?

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
An Zhuo is currently in the rescue station.

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,640
He's also in the police station

116
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,160
to contact his family.

117
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
He's under a lot of pressure

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,320
so he's in a little bit of a mental problem.

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's start now.

120
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
Can you briefly introduce yourself?

121
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,760
Okay.

122
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,880
My name is Mu Chengyun.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm a student of the National University.

124
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
Today, I was originally

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
experiencing the romantic life of

126
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
my actors on the street.

127
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
But I didn't expect that there was a romantic

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
and unbearable war on the street.

129
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,360
And then that girl

130
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
was also standing there.

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,120
I was afraid that there would be some danger.

132
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
You're so considerate.

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,440
What do you feel

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,880
after you've done it?

135
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
Is there anything on my face?

136
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
No.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
Then you've been looking at me all the time.

138
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I think you're a little familiar.

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
Penalty.

140
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you for liking me.

141
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
It's been a long time since I've acted.

142
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,640
I didn't expect that there would be a romantic.

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Thank you for your kind words.

144
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
I'll leave now.

145
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,040
Thank you for coming, Yifan.

146
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
You're welcome.

147
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,280
Thank you for your hard work.

148
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,240
It's okay.

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Tianjin.

150
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,080
Yifan.

151
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
I'll put the gas tank on the car.

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Be careful.

153
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
By the way, Yifan.

154
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,400
Do you want to find someone to rent?

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
I heard you said that

156
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
you have been in this room for three months.

157
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,840
How lucky are you?

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,920
I have a friend who wants to find someone to rent.

159
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
He's a good girl.

160
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
I think you two can be together.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,640
Is he in a hurry?

162
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,360
No.

163
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,720
He lives in his parents' house.

164
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,480
He can wait for your roommate to move.

165
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,760
As long as you give him a good name.

166
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,400
I'll go back and ask.

167
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,960
Okay.

168
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,520
I'll take this phone.

169
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:45,840
Okay.

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
I'll go first.

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,120
Okay.

172
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,640
Hello?

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,680
Where are you?

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,520
Near the neighborhood.

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
What's wrong?

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I'll go to the supermarket outside the neighborhood later.

177
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
Get something.

178
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,680
Hurry up.

179
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,320
I can't lift it.

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm at the supermarket.

181
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,240
Mo Cheng Yu.

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
Why is his name so familiar?

183
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Do you like this one?

184
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
Didn't you say you want to buy something?

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's go.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm not sure.

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,920
You want to buy something?

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
Let's go.

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
I haven't bought it yet.

190
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
Aren't you going to buy it?

191
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
It turns out that it's not the new one.

192
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,960
It's the one that's going to be bought later.

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,680
That's right.

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
What's wrong?

195
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,520
Why are you taking a break again?

196
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
I want to buy something too.

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,520
Don't worry.

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,960
If you can't get it later,

199
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,240
I'll get it for you.

200
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,000
How's the situation of your house decoration?

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,080
What's wrong?

202
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
I want to talk to you about this.

203
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,640
Talk about what?

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,040
When are you going to get it?

205
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm leaving.

206
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,520
We'll talk about it later.

207
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
It's not that you're the one who's

208
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,400
the one who introduced me to a girl.

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,840
But she's not in a hurry.

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,520
So I want to make sure of the time.

211
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Okay.

212
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,280
I'll ask about the decoration.

213
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll talk to you later.

214
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Nice.

215
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
This is the one.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,720
You can take it out.

217
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Sure.

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,320
I can't use it.

219
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,040
I'll give it to you.

220
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,200
Okay.

221
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Thank you.

222
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,240
Thank you.

223
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
What are you doing?

224
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm calculating the price.

225
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you say?

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,200
What price?

227
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
The price of the paper.

228
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,080
The price of the paper.

229
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
It's all private.

230
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,840
23 yuan.

231
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
120 grams per hour.

232
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
20 yuan.

233
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,640
140 grams per hour.

234
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,200
100 yuan per hour.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,360
23 times per hour.

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
23 times per hour.

237
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,760
1.9 yuan.

238
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,960
About.

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Then take this.

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,600
Sure.

241
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,400
I'll give you one.

242
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,400
But it's only 120 grams.

243
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Then take the paper.

244
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,960
I'll calculate it again.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,120
Wei Fang.

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
You're here to take part in the exam.

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
It's only half a year since you got your math.

248
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,000
There's not much time left.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
I'm afraid you'll lose.

250
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
I didn't calculate it.

251
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,160
What do you think I'll do for you this time?

252
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,600
The paper.

253
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,120
The figure of the paper.

254
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,000
The price has increased.

255
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
It seems a little expensive.

256
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
Brother Shuai, can you see the car?

257
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,440
It's just arrived.

258
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
It's fresh.

259
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,120
You can look at it.

260
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Let your wife take you back.

261
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
Go back.

262
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,840
Have a deep sleep.

263
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,520
Nice wife, too.

264
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
I won't get mad.

265
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
You slurped my wife!

266
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
So elegant!

267
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,480
Look.

268
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Mother.

269
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Okay, auntie. Do you want to split up?

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Please split up. Thank you.

271
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I've already split up. Let's do it together.

272
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Okay.

273
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Let's split up.

274
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I've already split up. I'll take care of you and...

275
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
I'll split up when I get back.

276
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll help you.

277
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
You didn't rush back?

278
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Where?

279
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
The car is parked in the car.

280
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Let's go.

281
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Don't you have any umbrella?

282
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Do you want me to give you a ride?

283
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I have an umbrella. You can have it.

284
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Are you eating my vinegar?

285
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You?

286
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
No.

287
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Here.

288
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Here.

289
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Here.

290
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Take the umbrella to your side.

291
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Take a look at me.

292
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Take a look at you.

293
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
You can't say anything.

294
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
What about you?

295
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
What are you talking about?

296
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
You can't say anything.

297
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Who was that guy?

298
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
I don't know.

299
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,400
He suddenly came to my house after I got back.

300
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
He looks a bit like a man.

301
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
He's pretending to be familiar now.

302
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't look at him.

303
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Get in the car.

304
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm going to the bathroom.

305
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I'll be back.

306
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

307
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Or you'll get a cold.

308
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Your clothes have already dried up.

309
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
You're so strong.

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Take some medicine. Take care.

311
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
These are all yours.

312
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
These...

313
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Yi Qing.

314
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I have an idea.

315
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,200
This is for you.

316
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Is this even a hard death measure, okay?

317
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,360
Me.

318
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,100
這樣下去採程機在今天管家拍攝了一集

319
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,180
Now we'll send some of them and see if they're all ready

320
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,740
the queuing video

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,100
Actually I prefer to skip the morning

322
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,320
No need to wait for the morning

323
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,860
To keep knives cool

324
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,740
So we just have to swept the game put 사람

325
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,660
Just get us some relationships

326
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,240
Serve cold wine

327
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
Bro Kuan

328
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Wang Kuan

329
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,420
Got back

330
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,960
I heard there's a酸辣

331
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,580
powinno

332
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
What are you doing?

333
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Recommend a horror movie for me.

334
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
Recently.

335
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
A horror movie with a new man.

336
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,580
The first day of the movie.

337
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Can't use this remote control.

338
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,580
It's better to watch horror movies like this.

339
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,580
Indeed.

340
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,580
People who are afraid of the light are afraid of the light.

341
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,580
It's better to watch it.

342
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,580
I think horror movies are usually turned off.

343
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,580
The first day of the movie.

344
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,580
Dad.

345
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Why is it so small?

346
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,580
I am afraid that it's too small.

347
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
The money is ready. I will transfer it to you now.

348
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
It smells good.

349
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I am laughing at this film.

350
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,580
This film is probably a low-quality film.

351
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
The actors should be proud of it.

352
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,580
The movie is not shown in the movie.

353
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
I am afraid that the film will be shown in the movie.

354
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Have you ever watched this movie?

355
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Yes.

356
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
We watched it together in Beiyu.

357
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Do you have any impression?

358
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,580
I have an impression of watching the movie with you.

359
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,580
But I can't watch it.

360
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Then what are you watching?

361
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,580
What are you doing?

362
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Why are you stopping?

363
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
It's finally a little bit of a atmosphere.

364
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
I will transfer it all to you.

365
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Are you going to be in a mood now?

366
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,580
It's really him.

367
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I am really a little bit of a person.

368
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
I am a little bit of a person.

369
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
I am a little bit of a person.

370
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,580
I am a little bit of a person.

371
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,580
You can recognize me as this bad guy.

372
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
What are you doing?

373
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Going back to the room.

374
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,580
I am not looking for you anymore.

375
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
I am just watching a horror movie.

376
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,580
Are you afraid?

377
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
Are you afraid?

378
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
Yes.

379
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
It's okay, Wen Yifan.

380
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
What do you mean?

381
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
You are wrong.

382
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
I know.

383
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,580
You are also afraid.

384
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,580
Why does he have to add an eye?

385
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,580
I am not afraid.

386
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
I am afraid.

387
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
Do you want to go to the main hall?

388
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,580
So at that time,

389
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Sang Yan fell asleep because of the ghost.

390
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,980
He Jackie chocked melock

391
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,740
Hyung难

392
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,700
Leave it to me

393
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,220
Wait

394
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,220
No

395
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,860
Me

396
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:17,680
I am afraid that will

397
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,160
Wait

398
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,840
I

399
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,740
Here

400
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,260
I already

401
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,580
Why are you laughing?

402
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
I've laughed with you many times.

403
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
It's not that funny.

404
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,580
What's wrong?

405
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
You're up so early.

406
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
You didn't sleep well?

407
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
It's okay.

408
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
You're dressed so formally this morning.

409
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
Where are you going?

410
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,580
I have a work interview.

411
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
You're looking for work?

412
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
It's work to look for me.

413
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,580
So many companies are taking this job.

414
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
I'm going to start my business today.

415
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,580
See you.

416
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Where's the overtime?

417
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
I'm going to the hospital.

418
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
I'm going to the hospital.

419
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
I'll be back.

420
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
I'll be back.

421
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,580
Are you going out?

422
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,580
I have an appointment.

423
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
You're the first one in the library?

424
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,580
Yes.

425
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
Do you play games?

426
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
I do.

427
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,580
Can you open the book?

428
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,580
Usually, I play some MMOs.

429
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
I have various types of games.

430
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Like SLG, ACD, RPG.

431
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
But I play the game of the combination.

432
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Tell me.

433
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,580
Which is better for the game of the combination?

434
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
The solution.

435
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,580
The solution is simple.

436
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
But every time you play,

437
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
you have to be smart and crafty.

438
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,580
The solution is to reduce movement

439
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
and reduce the number of changes.

440
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,580
It can also be a test of the value.

441
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,580
This is not a good thing to do.

442
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,580
So, what's your attitude to our company?

443
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
Nothing.

444
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
What about your salary?

445
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm playing games.

446
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
I'll ask you straight.

447
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
What's the reason

448
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,580
you're the one who came to our company?

449
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,580
There's no advantage in the job.

450
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,580
You have to work hard.

451
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Don't stay at home like Wu Ye and Youming.

452
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Is there anything else you want to ask about your job?

453
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,580
To find a job.

454
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Find a job?

455
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Okay.

456
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,580
The last question.

457
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,580
What do you think

458
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,580
is the most important thing in the game design?

459
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
If you start playing games,

460
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,580
what's the point?

461
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,580
It's a loneliness.

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,580
Everyone is lonely.

463
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,580
Everyone is lonely.

464
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Find a companion in the game.

465
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,580
You're asking for a leave?

466
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
Why are you still asking for a leave?

467
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,580
No, I want to say

468
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,580
you don't have to go far after work.

469
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
After we finish talking here,

470
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
you can go home and rest.

471
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
What are you thinking about?

472
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,580
How could I work so early?

473
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,580
I work 24 hours a day.

474
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Besides, I'm not your girlfriend.

475
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Why do you want to be with me?

476
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,580
Maybe I thought it was good to send you home last time.

477
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
Can I change it?

478
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
What's the point?

479
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,580
I don't know what you're thinking about.

480
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
What kind of person?

481
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Anyway, you're different from me.

482
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
What's the difference?

483
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
You don't take my orders.

484
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
What if Grandpa and Grandma ask about it?

485
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
I don't take orders.

486
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
But I can help you with your friend's mom.

487
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Thank you for helping me.

488
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Oh, right.

489
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
This is for you.

490
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,580
What's this?

491
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Look at your hand.

492
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
If you don't take off your coat,

493
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,580
your hands will be dirty.

494
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
Take it.

495
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Take it.

496
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
I'm taking the responsibility.

497
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
I'm leaving.

498
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Don't forget to wipe your hands.

499
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,580
Bye.

500
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,580
Grandma, why are you here?

501
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
Yes.

502
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
You asked me to come here?

503
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,580
What do you need help with?

504
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,580
Just tell me.

505
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,580
No need to take the orders.

506
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Are you doing business?

507
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
Don't be polite to me.

508
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,580
But your order only says

509
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,580
I should do something about it.

510
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,580
I'm not polite to you.

511
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
I'm not polite to you.

512
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,580
I'm not polite to you.

513
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,580
I'm not polite to you.

514
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
I should do something about it.

515
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Where are you going?

516
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm going to the Internet.

517
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
What's the order today?

518
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,580
It's simple.

519
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,580
The target is the target.

520
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
The target is the target of the target.

521
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,580
What do you mean?

522
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
I have no one to explain to you.

523
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,580
You can do whatever you want.

524
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,580
Aunt, which team do you like?

525
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Fan, I'm looking for you.

526
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Okay.

527
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,580
Aunt, what's the matter?

528
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Can we join the team?

529
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
You?

530
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,580
You didn't see our old lady?

531
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,580
This is arranged by the government.

532
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,580
What's wrong with you girls?

533
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Fan.

534
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,580
Here you are.

535
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Wait a minute.

536
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Grandpa Su.

537
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Grandpa Su.

538
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Linlin, why are you here?

539
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
I'm here to meet you.

540
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,580
My granddaughter-in-law.

541
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Grandpa, I'm not done yet.

542
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
Can we join the team?

543
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,580
Let's do the dance with Grandpa.

544
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Yes.

545
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
And my friend.

546
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Let's do it together.

547
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
How is it?

548
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,580
Fine.

549
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,580
I'm here to help you.

550
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Grandpa, you did a good job.

551
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,580
You did a great job.

552
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,580
You did a great job.

553
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

554
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
I can't do it, Grandpa.

556
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Linlin, you can't.

557
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,580
I'm afraid I have to be patient.

558
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,580
How about you go to the next room

559
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,580
and practice before you dance, okay?

560
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

561
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,580
It's okay.

562
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
You...

563
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
Hello, Grandpa.

564
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,580
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,580
I'll learn later.

566
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Your friend.

567
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,580
You teach me.

568
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
You?

569
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
Okay.

570
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Okay, come on.

571
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,080
mechanics.

572
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,980
All right.

573
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,780
Let's go back and taste the food now.

574
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Thank you, Imperial Madam Fang.

575
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,380
Listen to me, everyone!

576
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,780
Now we should go have a rest and drink.

577
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
Work hard!

578
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,880
Imperial Madam Fang.

579
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,620
Why didn't modoime come with you on a dance?

580
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Oh...

581
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,620
Miss.

582
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,620
Are you Shu-ge's brother, Shu-ge's wife?

583
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,620
Yes.

584
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,620
I heard her boss ran away with you.

585
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,620
No.

586
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Grandpa, who do you usually dance with?

587
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
It depends on the mood.

588
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Today and this. Tomorrow and that.

589
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Ju-ya.

590
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
Do you have a boyfriend?

591
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
No.

592
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,660
Or I can introduce you to my family's Xiao An.

593
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,380
He has a brother who is still single and has a long life.

594
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,180
They are still having a bar.

595
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,780
No need. I have someone I like.

596
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,620
Someone you like?

597
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,940
Then you should be more careful and pursue your own happiness.

598
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,700
Otherwise, when I get to my grandpa's age,

599
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,660
I will regret it.

600
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,260
Grandpa, you are also sorry.

601
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,220
Go ahead.

602
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,180
Thank you, grandpa.

603
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,340
Brother, I didn't expect you to leave.

604
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,940
Brother, you dance so well. I will dance with you the next day.

605
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,220
He is so handsome.

606
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,580
Look.

607
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,260
I am wearing a red dress.

608
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,300
So many red dresses. I can wear two.

609
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,340
Aunt Fang, you are so handsome.

610
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,660
You can't guess it so easily, right?

611
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,180
Then will you not eat one?

612
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,980
I will invite you to the tea party this year.

613
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,780
Grandpa, can I join you?

614
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,180
Of course.

615
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,060
Come on.

616
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,060
Grandpa!

617
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,980
What are you doing?

618
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,220
You are in the company. What do you need help with?

619
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,020
Call Wei Zheng, brother An. I will look for you.

620
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,260
What?

621
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,380
You are familiar with it?

622
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,860
You don't need to record it.

623
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,260
We are colleagues.

624
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,140
We can move to the company's hotel and work together.

625
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,860
You are so handsome. Who will be with you?

626
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,940
I think you are used to living with Wei Fan.

627
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,740
You can't leave.

628
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,460
Let's have dinner together.

629
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,060
Please be clear.

630
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,660
I am Zhong Siqiao.

631
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,260
Hello, Xiao Qiao. Let's have dinner together.

632
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,420
Call Wei Fan.

633
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,420
I will send you a address.

634
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,460
Grandpa, you don't need to.

635
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,060
Grandpa.

636
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,660
This is for you.

637
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,020
Thank you.

638
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,500
Don't eat it.

639
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,100
It's so delicious. I want to eat it.

640
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,540
Yes, you can eat it.

641
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,860
Yes.

642
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,980
It's so delicious.

643
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,220
The carrot is so authentic.

644
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,940
It's the same as my summer snack.

645
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,300
Look.

646
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,420
It's so crispy.

647
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,540
The butter is the best in the world.

648
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,100
I recommend it.

649
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,900
You can eat it.

650
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,940
Grandpa, the butter is bad for your health.

651
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,100
Do you want to buy something else?

652
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,740
Little girl, you are so old.

653
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,580
If you want to eat something, eat it.

654
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,700
If you want to have a relationship, go to have a talk.

655
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,100
You can live like your young people.

656
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,980
Do you agree?

657
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,060
Yes.

658
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:41,940
Brother Siqiao.

659
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,380
You are so young.

660
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,420
You are not good at business.

661
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,100
I will buy something else for you.

662
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,900
Look at the color.

663
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,060
You must eat more.

664
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,660
You are rich.

665
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,180
Just one bite.

666
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,780
Just one bite.

667
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,020
It's good.

668
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,340
Thank you.

669
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,180
Brother Siqiao.

670
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,580
Come on.

671
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,020
This is for you.

672
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,660
Thank you, Brother Siqiao.

673
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,140
Come on.

674
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,700
I also want to add another one.

675
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,660
Let's go upstairs.

676
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,740
This one.

677
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,500
This one.

678
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,340
Okay.

679
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,580
Okay.

680
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,260
Which one?

681
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,860
There is.

682
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,820
Don't.

683
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,420
Look at Grandpa.

684
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,140
He even gave Grandpa some vegetables.

685
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,820
Good.

686
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,740
Grandma is pretty.

687
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,980
You shouldn't have liked her.

688
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,540
She is not just looking at the outside.

689
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,620
I am telling you.

690
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,140
Grandma is really not that pretty.

691
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,740
She is so stubborn.

692
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,020
Today, thank you.

693
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Grandpa asked me to get up early.

694
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
I ate for this.

695
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,580
I wanted to find a new job in Sangyang.

696
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,820
But he is not here.

697
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,420
Is Sangyang's new job confirmed?

698
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,380
Don't worry.

699
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,500
I will call him when he comes to his company.

700
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,420
Look.

701
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,780
He is really sad.

702
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
He is so sad.

703
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
What is so sad?

704
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
What is so sad?

705
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
What is so sad?

706
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
What is so sad?

707
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
What is so sad?

708
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
What is so sad?

709
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
I am not here.

710
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
I am just kidding.

711
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Bro.

712
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Why are you here?

713
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
You are so surprised.

714
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
I am serious.

715
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Your host is here.

716
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
Come on.

717
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
Let's have a drink.

718
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Congratulations to Sangyang for joining my company.

719
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Congratulations.

720
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
But Sangyang.

721
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
Why did you suddenly find a job?

722
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
After he graduated,

723
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,780
he went straight to the difficult part.

724
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Who knows what will happen.

725
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
He won't do it.

726
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
Stop talking.

727
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Drink.

728
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Yes.

729
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Sangyang.

730
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Thank you for today.

731
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
No.

732
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,780
I will take a rest tonight.

733
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
I will take it as a compliment.

734
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
What are you talking about?

735
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
What is the point of training?

736
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
What is the point of training in a few hours?

737
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
I really feel that grandma is not late.

738
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
But she is still in school.

739
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
She is already one hundred years old.

740
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,780
She even went to those girls' parties with Mr. Wu Dao.

741
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,780
She is really making people angry.

742
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
When I find that person,

743
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,780
I will ask him why he wants to ruin others' family.

744
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
I am not saying that.

745
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I want you to help me

746
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,780
to find out whether he is reliable or not.

747
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Reliable or not?

748
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
If he is a reliable person,

749
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
and he is sincere with his grandpa,

750
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,780
I will help them.

751
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Grandma, you treat him so well.

752
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
Do you think that

753
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,780
if the two of us are together,

754
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
we will not be happy anymore?

755
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Is that a good love?

756
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,780
It is inevitable.

757
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Maybe he just met

758
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,780
the person who is most important in his life.

759
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,780
What should we do?

760
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
Grandma, you should

761
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
have a good talk with grandpa.

762
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
What?

763
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,780
I forgot what he said recently.

764
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,780
He doesn't even remember my birthday.

765
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,780
He doesn't even have a heart to me.

766
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Why should I hold him back?

767
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,780
I am sorry.

768
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
It seems that

769
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,780
it is not a big deal for a man.

770
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Maybe only girls care about the beginning.

771
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
It is not certain.

772
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,780
The location of the first station

773
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,780
is not good for anyone.

774
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
It is so difficult to be a dog.

775
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Don't talk.

776
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,780
Grandma,

777
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I am sorry.

778
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
I am sorry.

779
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,780
I am sorry.

780
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
I am sorry.

781
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I am sorry.

782
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
I am sorry.

783
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,780
I am sorry.

784
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,780
I am sorry.

785
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
I am sorry.

786
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
I am sorry.

787
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
I am sorry.

788
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,780
I am sorry.

789
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,780
I am sorry.

790
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,780
What are you doing?

791
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,780
I will teach you how to do it.

792
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Okay.

793
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
Your daughter is driving me crazy.

794
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
Am I leaving?

795
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
Okay.

796
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
So far,

797
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,780
you are don organizing all relationships.

798
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,780
I'll feel your changing face.

799
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,020
I can't stop this journey.

800
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,620
The sky and the earth are full of clouds.

801
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:31,140
But I have your voice.

802
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,580
How can I give up?

803
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,020
I won't give up.

804
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,700
You gave me courage

805
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,180
and the future I dream of.

806
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,900
You're the one I dream of.

807
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,820
I'll hold every promise.

808
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,020
Even if I'm still the hope,

809
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,900
I won't be alone anymore.

810
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,300
I want you to exist.

811
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:07,220
I can only be in the darkness before I die.
