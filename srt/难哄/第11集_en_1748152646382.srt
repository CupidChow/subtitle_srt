1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
The world is so vast, you are the only one who can be human

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate makes us meet

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Maybe it's because of you, I'm so worried about you

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so worried that I can't be with you

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
I've decided to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
I want to understand everything, and become a memory

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,200
All the storms and storms are for the rest of my life

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,600
It's for you, for you to be brave

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Even if there's someone at the end, I'll keep my word

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm not afraid of the world, I'm afraid of you

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm afraid of you, I'm afraid of you

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I've loved you for a long time

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Who's that?

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
Please open it.

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Here.

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
Thank you.

21
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
Your hand.

22
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Mom, who are you talking to?

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
Mom.

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Who are you talking to?

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,600
Mom! Mom!

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,200
What's wrong?

27
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,000
Auntie, the big man didn't let me get off the car.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,600
What are you doing?

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,800
You're the big man. You're pretending to be a ghost.

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
You want to scare the whole family, right?

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,600
You still know rice.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm the big man who can eat it for you.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Mom.

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,600
Son, you didn't scare me, right?

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm not scared.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't be scared. It's okay.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hurry up. Let's go home and sleep.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Okay.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I accidentally hit you.

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,000
Why didn't you tell me about your intention?

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,800
I didn't. I just accidentally hit you.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,400
You'll be tested soon.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Protect yourself.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Okay.

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
What are you doing?

46
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Paint it.

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Wait. If you hurt it, you'll fly away.

48
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Can you see?

49
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
What do I need to see?

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Pretty.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why isn't Xi Zi here?

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's not around.

53
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She's got a friend.

54
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's go.

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thanks.

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Did I go wrong yesterday?

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I didn't do anything inappropriate.

58
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
Didn't you say that last time?

59
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,440
If you see me again,

60
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
you'll be in a bad mood.

61
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I didn't say anything.

62
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm still anxious to get close to you.

63
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
Not get close to you.

64
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
I want to remind you.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Do you want to eat?

66
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,800
Yes.

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What did I do last night?

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
Didn't you sleep at that time?

69
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,280
No.

70
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I didn't do anything inappropriate, right?

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You didn't do anything inappropriate,

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but you did something more than that.

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Can't you think of a minor?

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What did I do again?

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
Don't Theory King say any inappropriate things.

76
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
What was the reason?

77
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,040
As of a clean subject,

78
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm afraid to tell you this later.

79
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,360
It's more useless for my acting.

80
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
You're so considerate and open-minded.

81
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,440
But you can accept what you can say.

82
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
I can't accept it.

83
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,560
What do you want me to say

84
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,760
that you can't accept it?

85
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
You can say that.

86
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm in a good mood recently.

87
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
I won't tell you about it for now.

88
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,640
But I'll

89
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
keep on

90
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
keeping on

91
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
keeping on

92
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,960
keep on changing.

93
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,280
Can you say it now?

94
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,480
It's not the time now.

95
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,720
How do I say it?

96
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,360
I want

97
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,800
to take the money.

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,560
Can I

99
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,560
write you a note

100
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,320
because I don't have any salary now?

101
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,840
And if you really have a next time,

102
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
just wake me up

103
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
and call me up.

104
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,680
What do you think I am?

105
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,640
I'll tell you about it later.

106
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,400
But after you finish your work.

107
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,160
Can I ask you a question?

108
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,840
Go ahead.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,240
Where did I go?

110
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,360
I'm not the first time to see a friend like her.

111
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,360
She should be the one to push me away when I have time.

112
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
This is our editing room.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,360
If you want to use your editing room,

114
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
you have to report it in advance.

115
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Of course.

116
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
If I don't have someone,

117
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I can use it secretly.

118
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Okay.

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
This is our teammate, Wei Yifan.

120
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
What's up?

121
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Two new interns.

122
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Hello, I'm Mu Chengyu.

123
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm a new intern.

124
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
What senior?

125
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Just call me Yifan.

126
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,360
Who do you call senior?

127
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Who?

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Mu Chengyu.

129
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Hurry up.

130
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Long time no see.

131
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
I've learned it from you.

132
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
She's still a new intern.

133
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Have you watched her movie?

134
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
No.

135
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
What movie?

136
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I'll see if I've watched it.

137
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
What movie?

138
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
A Sword Ghost?

139
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Don't write it.

140
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Yes.

141
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I didn't expect Yifan to be my fan.

142
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
You've watched it.

143
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I'll go watch it, too.

144
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
By the way,

145
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
my name is Fang Li.

146
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll call you Yifan after I get the money.

147
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I... I'll send you a WeChat message.

148
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Okay.

149
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Right.

150
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I'll send you a work group.

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Right.

152
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
I'll send you a work group.

153
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll tell you

154
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
about the work group's idea.

155
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
We'll eat at work.

156
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Okay.

157
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll take you to the office.

158
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Let's get familiar with the work environment.

159
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Okay.

160
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Here.

161
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
You can have your lunch.

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Okay.

163
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
This is our little meeting room.

164
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
And we're going to the center.

165
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Hello.

166
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
The center.

167
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
This is our little meeting room.

168
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
What are you doing?

169
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
What are you doing?

170
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Take good care of these two people.

171
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Thank you.

172
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,520
Brother Hua terrorism

173
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Relax

174
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,620
ified

175
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,340
Let me bother you

176
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,520
Well

177
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
This is not a bowl.

178
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
How can it be so full?

179
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Next time,

180
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
do you still want to live for a long time?

181
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,520
How long will you live?

182
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Thank you.

183
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I don't mean anything else.

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I just want to confirm

185
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,520
that I can start to think about my new life.

186
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,520
You owe me a debt.

187
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
What debt?

188
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
What?

189
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
I also want to remind you.

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
You, Li Zhiwei, are being beaten by the King of the Yulong.

191
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Please take it from me.

192
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
What?

193
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Li Fan.

194
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I saw you were answering the message.

195
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
You wanted to know if you had any problems.

196
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Tell me.

197
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
I can help you.

198
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
No, thank you.

199
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I still have a lot of questions to ask you.

200
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I'll teach you later.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Anyway, from today on,

202
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I'll stick to you.

203
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I'll be your teacher.

204
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
I'll be your teacher.

205
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Why?

206
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
They asked me to learn from you

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,520
during the internship.

208
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Now, there are two options

209
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
for the missing daughter

210
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
who is now in the new house,

211
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
and the poor mother who is looking for her missing daughter.

212
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Wang Jing, Li Fan.

213
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
You two choose one.

214
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I can choose both.

215
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
But Li Fan,

216
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
you should be afraid of ghosts.

217
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Then I'll choose the missing daughter.

218
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I can choose both.

219
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Okay, it's settled then.

220
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
She chose a bad idea.

221
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Why did she give you a bad idea?

222
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Li Fan,

223
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
why don't you try to choose the missing daughter?

224
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
She seems to be a good painter.

225
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Or do you have any expectations for the choice?

226
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
It's the same.

227
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
The mother is looking for her daughter.

228
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
It seems that she can only choose the direction of the missing daughter.

229
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Let's pass the pass and see where the daughter might go.

230
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
The sea is really a body.

231
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
It's not good to fly.

232
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
You just came to study.

233
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Don't think about the plan.

234
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Or if I find someone,

235
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
can you tell me about it?

236
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
The prize for you is

237
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
the prize for the exam.

238
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm just good.

239
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,520
If I get it right,

240
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I won't tell you.

241
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Wait for the prize for the exam.

242
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I don't have a chance to talk.

243
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I do.

244
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Eat.

245
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Eat.

246
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Okay.

247
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
That's all for today's meeting.

248
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Go back to work.

249
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Ji Tao.

250
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
Okay.

251
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Li Fan.

252
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
I'll go get the equipment.

253
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I'll follow you all the time.

254
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:58,440
Go to the wind

255
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Hello.

256
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Why did you call me?

257
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
What?

258
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Forget it.

259
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,520
I'll talk to you later.

260
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
You've been missing me for a long time.

261
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
Yes.

262
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Think about it.

263
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Are you in a hurry?

264
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
I'm busy.

265
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
I'll go and get the equipment.

266
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I'll see you later.

267
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Okay.

268
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
I'll be there soon.

269
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Bye.

270
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Bye.

271
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Bye.

272
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Bye.

273
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
See you.

274
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Bye.

275
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Think about it.

276
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Are you in a hurry?

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
What can I do?

278
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I...

279
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm afraid you can't handle it.

280
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
I...

281
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,520
When did you contact him?

282
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
I contacted him last year.

283
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,520
He was in a hurry to pay me back every month.

284
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,520
He didn't turn around at the beginning of the year.

285
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I was in a hurry to pay him back every day.

286
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Look at my legs.

287
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
They're all like this.

288
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Niu Niu.

289
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
You saw it.

290
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
You contacted your mother.

291
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
You sent a letter to her.

292
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
This is it.

293
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
Thank you.

294
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Did you find him?

295
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,520
The director said he's been missing for a week.

296
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
He's afraid of the final exam.

297
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
He's wasted time and no results.

298
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Sister Fan, I found him.

299
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,520
So his mother is not in Nanwu.

300
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
He went to look for his daughter.

301
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
How did you know?

302
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
So his mother went to the place where his daughter lived.

303
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,520
And the news about this happened on the day of the divorce.

304
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
So we have to go to the divorce.

305
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Divorce?

306
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Sister Fan.

307
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,520
I've prepared the stuff for the divorce.

308
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Look at the book.

309
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Tell me.

310
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Thank you.

311
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Sister Fan, Chen Yun, I'm leaving.

312
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Bye.

313
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Bye.

314
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
Take care.

315
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Okay.

316
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Okay.

317
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I ordered some pizza.

318
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Do you want some?

319
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
No.

320
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
You don't like it?

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
You eat.

322
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm leaving.

323
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Can I leave now?

324
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
It's okay.

325
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I'll stay with you.

326
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Let's work together.

327
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
No.

328
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I'll have dinner with my friend.

329
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Diandian.

330
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Let's go.

331
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Here you are.

332
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Hello.

333
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm Mr. Shi, the exclusive intern of Sister Fan.

334
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm Mu Chengyu.

335
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Brother Xiaoshuai, get in the car.

336
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I'm in trouble.

337
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
I'm kidding.

338
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,520
Let's have dinner together.

339
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Okay.

340
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Bye.

341
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Bye, Sister Fan.

342
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I think you're definitely interested in her.

343
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't joke around.

344
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Our family is just a work-related business.

345
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,520
A single-minded girl works overtime.

346
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,600
Then add some more

347
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,520
and you'll be able to work overtime.

348
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
Isn't that a good idea?

349
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
I think you're very sensible.

350
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
I don't drink.

351
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I'm not.

352
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
I'm just a regular.

353
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
I'm not a regular.

354
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I'm just a regular.

355
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I'm not a regular.

356
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm just a regular.

357
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
You don't drink?

358
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
No.

359
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I don't drink at all.

360
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Actually, I'm here today

361
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
to ask you for help.

362
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
What?

363
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Do you want me to help you

364
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
to send you a cute little brother?

365
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I can take this.

366
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I want to see

367
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
if you have time to go to my place tonight

368
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
and sleep with me.

369
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
What's wrong?

370
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Did Sang Yan bully you?

371
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Did he hit you or take you to hit him?

372
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
No.

373
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Then what?

374
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
I think I have a dream.

375
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
A dream?

376
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I never heard you mention it before.

377
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,520
I've had it before.

378
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
But it's been a long time since I had it.

379
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
And it seems like it's started again.

380
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
But it's just possible.

381
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
How do you know?

382
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Sang Yan said it.

383
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
He saw it.

384
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Maybe.

385
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Then what did you do

386
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
when you didn't know you were a dreamer?

387
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
I said I was a dreamer.

388
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm sure he doesn't remember it.

389
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Did Sang Yan say

390
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
what you did?

391
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
You were beaten by the net

392
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
and tried to take advantage of me.

393
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Anyway, you can go to bed tonight

394
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
and help me confirm

395
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
whether I'm starting to be a dreamer again.

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Okay?

397
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Okay. Don't worry.

398
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I'll take care of you.

399
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
In this way,

400
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
to make it better,

401
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
let's be humble.

402
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Okay.

403
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Let's go home.

404
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Bad news.

405
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
I'm afraid that

406
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
you won't come back.

407
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
You can just be fearless.

408
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
How can I be fearless?

409
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
If I really

410
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
sit up and give me a hug tonight,

411
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
how can I be fearless?

412
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Don't worry.

413
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
I'm very light-hearted.

414
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
When I'm at home,

415
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
my dad will beat me up

416
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
and beat me up.

417
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm afraid that

418
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I'll be scared.

419
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I'm afraid that

420
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
you'll be scared.

421
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm afraid that

422
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
I'll be scared.

423
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
I'm afraid that I'll be scared.

424
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Please.

425
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Come and sit down.

426
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
You're not sleepy, right?

427
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Yes.

428
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
You're not back yet?

429
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
You're back?

430
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
Hi.

431
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
How come it's you?

432
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,520
You...

434
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
You're not sleeping yet?

435
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Yes.

436
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Did you get any information

437
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
that I sent you?

438
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
We've been together all the time.

439
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
Please don't mind.

440
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
You can continue.

441
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
I won't bother you.

442
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I won't bother you.

443
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
So,

444
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
he's the one who took advantage of you?

445
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
How can he?

446
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
I'm so stupid.

447
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
I feel like I'm just him.

448
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Right?

449
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
You promised me that

450
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
you'd protect me.

451
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
I'll protect you.

452
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
So, last night,

453
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
why didn't you tell me

454
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
about it?

455
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
I said I had nowhere to go yesterday.

456
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
I was already begging him.

457
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
I had to think of a way

458
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
to protect myself.

459
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Protect yourself?

460
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
What do you mean?

461
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,520
You said you'd think too much.

462
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
I'm fine.

463
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
You also want to sleep?

464
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
I'm fine.

465
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
So, did you sleep well last night?

466
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm sure I did.

467
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
You didn't sleep well last night.

468
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
You did.

469
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
It's okay.

470
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
You can have fun.

471
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
What about you?

472
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Did you sleep well?

473
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
We did.

474
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
It's okay if you don't disturb me.

475
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
It's fun to eat.

476
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
What do you mean by eating?

477
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
It's fun to eat.

478
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
It's fun to eat.

479
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Are you done?

480
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
By the way,

481
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm not coming back tonight.

482
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
So, you can

483
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
be more independent.

484
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Where are you going?

485
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
To the river.

486
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
You're going to the river?

487
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
To cook.

488
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
It's like a snowy place.

489
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
You're so good at cooking.

490
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
If you didn't give me a mask,

491
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
I wouldn't even be able to breathe.

492
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I've done something here.

493
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Don't teach me this.

494
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
I'll teach you from the beginning.

495
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
I'm absolutely the master.

496
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
You can't take me here.

497
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Don't be so considersate.

498
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Let me help you with your health.

499
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
This is my sister's condolence.

500
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I got a quicklyように.

501
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I was so disappointed.

502
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
So I don't need any excuse.

503
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,120
Okay.

504
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Can we start?

505
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,720
My daughter went to work in a box

506
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,520
after graduating from college.

507
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
She worked for five years.

508
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,520
She gave me some money every month.

509
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
But before the New Year,

510
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,520
she suddenly broke her contact.

511
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,920
There was no news about the New Year or the New Year.

512
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,520
She didn't give me the money.

513
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,720
What money?

514
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Her mother took care of her daughter.

515
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,520
I was worried that she might have an accident.

516
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,320
My daughter,

517
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
if you see her on TV,

518
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,920
call her back.

519
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,720
Tell her to be safe.

520
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,320
Do you have feelings for your daughter?

521
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,320
Have you ever had any conflicts?

522
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,120
In the world,

523
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,120
how can a mother be bad to her daughter?

524
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,520
I lost my husband

525
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,320
in order to pull her out.

526
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
I lost my job.

527
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,320
How can she be so mean to me?

528
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,920
Hello?

529
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,520
Is the food ready?

530
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,320
Yes.

531
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
Is it cold over there?

532
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,120
Remember to wear some clothes.

533
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,720
You haven't called me for a long time.

534
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,520
I've been busy lately.

535
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
I know you're busy.

536
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,720
So I didn't dare to call you.

537
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,920
How are you going to

538
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
keep your word?

539
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Can you show her to your side?

540
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,120
How about going to her mother?

541
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,920
She's your grandma after all.

542
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
I'll think about it.

543
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,520
Right?

544
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,120
Jian,

545
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,120
mom knows you blame me.

546
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,120
I didn't take the responsibility

547
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,120
of being a mother after your dad died.

548
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
You can say whatever you want.

549
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Don't mention my dad.

550
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
I've been dreaming about you these days.

551
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,520
Then blame me.

552
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Okay, stop crying.

553
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,720
I'm fine.

554
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,720
Don't worry.

555
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,120
I'll go to see you later.

556
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,120
I'll hang up.

557
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,520
Don't worry.

558
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,520
We'll try our best to find a girl for you.

559
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,720
You have to keep your word.

560
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,520
This is so embarrassing.

561
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,920
You're going to be like this in the spring.

562
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,720
I mean, mom,

563
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
this is so embarrassing.

564
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Why didn't you keep asking?

565
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
I think her daughter won't be willing to see her.

566
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,320
She must hide some reasons.

567
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,120
She doesn't think she has any problem.

568
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,120
Right.

569
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,120
This is a family bond.

570
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,120
Maybe this is the reason

571
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,520
why her daughter disappeared.

572
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
How do you know?

573
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
Tomorrow's plane.

574
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,720
The next time is the promotion.

575
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Aren't you going with me?

576
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,720
No.

577
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,120
Didn't you live here before?

578
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Did you take me around?

579
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Hello, Tian.

580
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
I found her daughter in Hong Kong.

581
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,320
She's currently working in a dance studio.

582
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,920
Okay, I got it.

583
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,520
What's wrong?

584
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,520
Did you get a call from the bank?

585
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,520
Where's Jin Zhiyou?

586
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,120
Yes.

587
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,720
She's going to take all the evidence.

588
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
She's handed in the data.

589
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Where are we going?

590
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Hong Kong.

591
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,120
So we should delay one day

592
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,120
before we can go back.

593
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:41,920
Okay.

594
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,720
Okay.

595
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,320
Okay.

596
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,520
Then...

597
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,920
Sister Yubai, your phone.

598
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,320
Thank you.

599
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,520
Who is it?

600
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,120
We're colleagues.

601
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
You sound like a kid.

602
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,120
You saw her at the supermarket last time.

603
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,120
Now she's here to attend our group meeting.

604
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Didn't you bring the umbrella?

605
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,120
Do you want me to send you home?

606
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,720
Why do you have an umbrella?

607
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,520
What do you want?

608
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,120
Are you eating my vinegar?

609
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I'll put it in your bag.

610
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Take it.

611
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,320
Okay.

612
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,320
Let's go.

613
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm so hungry.

614
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Why do you like food?

615
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
I'm not hungry.

616
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
Forget it. I'll go get it myself.

617
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Hello, you're from the police station, right?

618
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
The police station's police station.

619
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Listen to me.

620
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,720
My girlfriend is going to the police station with me.

621
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,120
Hello, we're from the police station.

622
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
And we have a bar.

623
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,320
Hello, we're from the police station.

624
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
We're from the police station.

625
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,320
What's my name?

626
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,120
Mo Chengyu.

627
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
May I ask if there's a lady named Lin Yuqin?

628
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm sorry.

629
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,720
There's no lady in our group.

630
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,720
May I ask

631
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,720
if there's any other dance teacher in this building?

632
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,120
I'm not sure.

633
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,120
You'd better ask them in other places.

634
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,320
Do you have anything else?

635
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,920
If you don't, I'll go to work.

636
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,920
Thank you.

637
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,320
What should we do now?

638
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Do we have to find a way back

639
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,320
or find someone we don't know?

640
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,920
Wait a minute.

641
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,620
Let's move our table.

642
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,920
Thank you.

643
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,720
Mr. Dong,

644
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,920
let's change the light to john.

645
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
I have a volunteer help here.

646
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
I've just heard you haven't had lunch.

647
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I ordered a meal for you.

648
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm sorry. I don't accept the money.

649
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,120
We just want to talk.

650
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Don't worry. Your mother doesn't know that we're here.

651
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
You can open the phone.

652
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,120
You can open the phone.

653
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm very happy now.

654
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,120
I have my own family.

655
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Please don't come to me again.

656
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Okay. Give her this meal.

657
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,120
Don't you have anything to say?

658
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
I should say something.

659
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,120
Tell the gossip group that he got married to a man and had a baby.

660
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,120
Or tell everyone that the man ran away with his son and abandoned him.

661
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Now you think of me as a woman.

662
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,120
Or should you give up your freedom and take me as his property?

663
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
I'll get a living from it every month.

664
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
I can understand you.

665
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
How can you understand?

666
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
You're not my mother.

667
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
My mother is very similar to her.

668
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,120
But when I left the manor, he didn't look for me and didn't care about me.

669
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,120
If it were you, you'd forgive him.

670
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
I won't.

671
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
At least now I won't.

672
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't want you to run away.

673
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,120
So, you must wait for him.

674
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
Go back.

675
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
What's wrong?

676
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,120
Nothing. I'm just a little bit nervous.

677
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
I can't do it.

678
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,120
No way. They're cute.

679
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
I'll go see them.

680
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
Come on, kids.

681
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,120
I can't stand you. What happened?

682
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Sit down.

683
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Sit down.

684
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
What's wrong?

685
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Espella.

686
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
What's wrong?

687
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,120
I'm so stupid. I can't even jump.

688
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
I'm so dizzy.

689
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
What's wrong?

690
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
I'm so tired.

691
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
It's hard.

692
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Stand up and look at the teacher.

693
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
Take a move.

694
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,120
Are you tired?

695
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
Let's take a break.

696
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
We'll practice more.

697
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
You're called Espella?

698
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
You did great.

699
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Just a little thing.

700
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,120
When I do a move, stand up.

701
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,120
When you do a move, you need to focus on your body.

702
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Then you can't look at the ground.

703
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Look at the front.

704
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I'll do a demonstration.

705
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,120
I think the teacher won't keep going there.

706
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,120
I think so.

707
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
So happy.

708
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
It's tiring for him.

709
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Let me see.

710
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,120
I won't take a nap.

711
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
It's so tiring.

712
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
I can't look.

713
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Feeling a bit stunned.

714
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
It's Tie Xin personality.

715
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,960
we didn't have highK 어�ins cowardice

716
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
Then i see that you know

717
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
Your main stage is

718
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:25,760
Ace

719
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Bye, sister.

720
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
Bye.

721
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Thank you.

722
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Here we go.

723
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Go to the building.

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Chenyin, here.

725
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I said I don't need to pick you up.

726
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I'm not a kid anymore.

727
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
You're a brat.

728
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
You're going to celebrate your birthday today.

729
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I'll pick you up at home.

730
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Really?

731
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
Sister Yifan, introduce yourself.

732
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
This is my sister.

733
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Hello.

734
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Hello.

735
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
I always mention you.

736
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
She didn't want to bother you.

737
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Oh, right.

738
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
Someone is picking you up.

739
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I don't have a habit.

740
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
Then let's go.

741
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
We'll take you home first.

742
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Yeah, let's go together.

743
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
I'll take the car.

744
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Yifan.

745
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
Why are you here?

746
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
I just sent my friend.

747
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I just got my ID.

748
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
You just sent her?

749
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm a basic gift as a roommate.

750
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
Sister Yifan.

751
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
This is the roommate in your class.

752
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
Yeah.

753
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I can't go.

754
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I'll go first.

755
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Bye, Yifan.

756
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Thank you.

757
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Let's go.

758
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
It's so far away.

759
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
I always think it's hard.

760
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
It's a bit familiar.

761
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
It's like a sightseeing.

762
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
Is it in Hong Kong?

763
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
No.

764
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Is the job done?

765
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
No.

766
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
I think it's quite happy.

767
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
We went to Hong Kong together.

768
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
It's okay.

769
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
What's wrong?

770
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
You must be not happy.

771
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I was thinking

772
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
when I was in the process of

773
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
facing the job,

774
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
did I do something wrong?

775
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
I thought it should be more calm and more objective.

776
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
You're a human.

777
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
You're not a typhoon.

778
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,760
But I'm easily influenced by the typhoon's emotions.

779
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm working on my own.

780
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
Just do it yourself.

781
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Qing Yu He didn't find a college student.

782
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
What's the truth?

783
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Nothing.

784
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
Nothing?

785
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
I really think

786
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
that the university has been

787
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,760
a meeting for two years.

788
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
It's not worth thinking about.

789
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
It's a place

790
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
that I don't regret.

791
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
I even hope

792
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,760
I won't ever be there.

793
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
You and the master's rumors.

794
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
He's been making trouble.

795
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
You didn't do anything.

796
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,760
Why do you care about him?

797
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Or are you really afraid

798
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
that people will gossip about you?

799
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I've never done anything.

800
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm afraid that others will misunderstand.

801
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Then why do you leave?

802
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Because there's no worth

803
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
in this world.

804
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
Will you rest

805
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
or go to another workplace?

806
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
I'll meet other male colleagues.

807
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I have a question.

808
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I suddenly want to marry a girl.

809
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
When I left,

810
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I even bought myself

811
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
a cake.

812
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,760
I remember you said that

813
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,760
you lost your mind

814
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
when you did the plane last time.

815
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
Why?

816
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Because

817
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I was afraid

818
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
that you would be in trouble.

819
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I'm afraid.

820
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Good night.

821
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Some friends.

822
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:39,600
But some surprises have come

823
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,400
Who is it?

824
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,560
Why do you sounds like an 对恒子

825
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,920
It was荻istics university of Shang's Superкую

826
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,560
OK

827
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Duan Dianxue.

828
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
What's wrong?

829
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,760
Have you booked the ticket?

830
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
No.

831
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
What's wrong?

832
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,760
How many days do you plan to live here?

833
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,760
I'll live here tomorrow afternoon.

834
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,760
I'll stay here for a few days.

835
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,760
You don't think you'll be able to live here?

836
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,760
I'm in France.

837
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
You're like a big electric fan.

838
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
You should go.

839
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,760
I'll stay here for a few days.

840
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,760
I'll stay here for a few days.

841
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Oh, right. Someone's coming to pick you up.

842
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
I don't have time for this.

843
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
Wei Yifan.

844
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,760
Why are you here?

845
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I just sent my friend here.

846
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,760
I just got my ticket.

847
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,760
I'm leaving.

848
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I'm leaving.

849
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
I'm leaving.

850
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
I'm leaving.

851
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
I'm leaving.
