1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
The world is full of people, you are the one who is alone

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate makes us meet

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe it's because of you, I'm so worried about you

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm so worried that I can't be with you

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,400
I've decided to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I've always understood, I've always changed my memory

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
All the storms and storms are because of the storm

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
It's because of you, I'm so worried about you

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Even if there's someone at the end, I will be there

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not good at being full of people, I'm afraid of you

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,800
I'm holding you, holding you

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,800
I've loved you before

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Where are you?

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm reading.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,200
Come back quickly.

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Buy me some things.

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,320
The family is waiting for you.

22
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,200
Okay, I got it.

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Hurry up.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Sorry.

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
I have to go.

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:46,200 --> 00:04:05,920
Always come and play us.

30
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
We...

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,080
We have to go.

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll go to find some things.

33
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm not going anywhere.

34
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm just here to buy things.

35
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
What's wrong with you?

36
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm just here to buy things.

37
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I think you're a smart girl.

38
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
You're just here to buy things.

39
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
You're just here to buy things.

40
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
You won't be back early to help.

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,480
Really?

42
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,880
You and I bought a chicken soup.

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,480
Don't give me anything.

44
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,280
I don't want to drink.

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
I can't drink anything.

46
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
And you drink it.

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Why should he drink it?

48
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,080
He doesn't deserve to drink it.

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Are you here to buy me some new little goods?

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
If I tell you to give me trouble,

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,680
don't blame me for not giving you mom the flour.

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,480
Isn't this job pretty good?

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
You can learn from people.

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,680
You're so worried.

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,480
Be careful not to fall.

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Which weekend will you come to me and not affect learning?

57
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
What?

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
I said you come to me every weekend.

59
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
But you want to learn?

60
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
No.

61
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm doing well now.

62
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
I'm a good student.

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm a good student.

64
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm a good student.

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm a good student.

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
That's good.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
You're so anxious to leave this weekend.

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
What happened?

69
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I forgot.

70
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
That's good.

71
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,280
By the way, did you take the book I'm returning?

72
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Come on.

73
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,880
You're leaving.

74
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,480
You're leaving.

75
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
You're leaving.

76
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
You're leaving.

77
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
A-Jing.

78
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,480
What are you doing here?

79
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
Looking for you.

80
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
When will you say that?

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
I'll tell you later.

82
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,880
Let's talk about it later.

83
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
A-Jing.

84
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,080
You were not happy at home last time.

85
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Did you get excited?

86
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,480
I told you that I told your mom about this.

87
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
I didn't need to hide it from you.

88
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
I said you're a girl who's a little girl.

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
You won't care about your mom.

90
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
A-Jing.

91
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
What's the matter?

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Tell me.

93
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Look.

94
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,680
There were so many things happened in the past.

95
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
You must have been angry with me.

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Actually, I came here today to make up for it.

97
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I'll show you.

98
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Look.

99
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
If you want to talk to the boss...

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Stop right there.

101
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Stop right there.

102
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Look.

103
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,080
Your phone fell down.

104
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
You must accompany me.

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
What are you doing?

106
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
What are you doing?

107
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm telling the truth.

108
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Who are you?

109
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,080
I'm a mother.

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
Who are you?

111
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Who are you?

112
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm her boyfriend.

113
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Your boyfriend is so nice.

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm telling you.

115
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
You must accompany her.

116
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm telling you.

117
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Don't ask me about the money.

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm telling you.

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
I'm telling you.

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
What's wrong with you?

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
You're a coward.

122
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
You want to kill me?

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
You're a coward.

124
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
You're a coward.

125
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
What are you doing?

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't touch me.

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Don't touch me.

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm telling you.

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Don't touch me.

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Okay.

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Wait.

132
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Wait.

133
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Don't touch me.

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
You're not done yet.

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Wait.

136
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
A-Jing.

137
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Are you okay, sister?

138
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Sister.

139
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Sister.

140
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Tell me.

141
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
You're so mean.

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
Okay.

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
You'll be fine.

144
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Who told me to be a man

145
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
in the name of Su Zi?

146
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Not necessarily.

147
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
I heard you're looking for a new person.

148
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
What's wrong with you?

149
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Well...

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Yifan.

151
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Come.

152
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Have breakfast.

153
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I must eat.

154
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Yes.

155
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm in a good condition.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Mr. Fu.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
You'll go to the foreign market with me this morning.

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Let's go.

159
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
Foreign market?

160
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
I said I didn't...

161
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm leaving.

162
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
You're so mean.

163
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Let's go.

164
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't waste your time.

165
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
I'll go with you.

166
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Okay.

167
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll go with you.

168
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay.

169
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Bye.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I'll go with you.

171
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
Okay.

172
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Go.

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Bye.

174
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Bye.

175
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Go.

176
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Bye.

177
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Okay.

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Bye.

179
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Bye.

180
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,720
I can't stand it anymore.

181
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm here.

182
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,040
You don't want to talk to me?

183
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
I can't sleep.

184
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Why are you so weird?

185
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
You're leaving in the middle of the night.

186
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Do you want to turn on the light?

187
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Wei Fan.

188
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
If you're not feeling well,

189
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I can work hard to talk to you.

190
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
I'll be there.

191
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
What's wrong with you?

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
I'm going to the flower garden.

193
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Wei Fan.

194
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,280
You...

195
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,080
The flower garden destination is an unknown sentimental street.

196
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,380
Can you come over?

197
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,680
We meet again in the next time

198
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,680
How do you go 鹊

199
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
Go

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
Where are the things to keep

201
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,840
I don't diversify

202
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,040
Why does Create a copy of it

203
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,560
No change

204
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I have a date. I'm leaving.

205
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
But you're getting married.

206
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
You don't know how long I've been eating this bowl of noodles.

207
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
You're not that good at eating.

208
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Don't you think it's too bland?

209
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,880
Eat slowly, mom.

210
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm going to eat.

211
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I'll eat later.

212
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
It's delicious.

213
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Come here.

214
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
I'm still young. I'm sorry.

215
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Come.

216
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Let's have lunch.

217
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Let's eat.

218
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Weijing fish.

219
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Zhong Siqiao?

220
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
It's been a long time.

221
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,880
How are you doing?

222
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
I'm fine.

223
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
You're here to eat noodles with your friend?

224
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Aren't you a 17-year-old Wen Yifan?

225
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
I haven't seen you at the last reunion.

226
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,880
I just went back to Nanmu for a long time.

227
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
How are you doing with him?

228
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Who?

229
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Sang Yan.

230
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
When I was working overtime that day,

231
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I saw him here.

232
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
How are you doing recently?

233
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm different from the people who are in the industry.

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,880
I'm just a husband and a child.

235
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
It's been a long time.

236
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
You've changed a lot.

237
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Why don't I introduce my husband to you?

238
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
Husband.

239
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Come.

240
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
This is my husband.

241
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
We opened a small company recently.

242
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
We're going to the market next year.

243
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
Come.

244
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Are you still single?

245
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,880
Or let my husband introduce you to the friends who are around him.

246
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Thank you.

247
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Grandpa.

248
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
You're so stubborn.

249
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Grandpa.

250
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
Come here.

251
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Which one?

252
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Yan An's.

253
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Is it good?

254
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Let's go.

255
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
We're done.

256
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Let's go.

257
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Okay.

258
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
We'll see you next time.

259
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Okay. Bye.

260
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Bye.

261
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
Grandpa.

262
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

263
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
How can he be stubborn?

264
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,880
He's been saying that every day when he goes to school.

265
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
Some of us don't know Sang Yan.

266
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Because he knows everything.

267
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Let's go.

268
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Let's go.

269
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Fang Yan.

270
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Good morning.

271
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Fang Yan.

272
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I heard from others.

273
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
You're chasing the dance student you've chosen.

274
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
You're ignoring me because of him.

275
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
None of your business.

276
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
I'm just curious.

277
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
Since you don't have any words.

278
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I want to tell you.

279
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,880
Actually, I really like...

280
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
You've been practicing at school.

281
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
We can have a date.

282
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
When we get to college.

283
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
About Wei Yifan.

284
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
I heard from others.

285
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,880
You don't have to be unhappy.

286
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
You've been through so many times.

287
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
It's so boring.

288
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I knew it.

289
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
It's all fake.

290
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
I just want to tell you.

291
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
Am I wrong?

292
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
And.

293
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I don't like you.

294
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
I'm not a hot-headed.

295
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
I don't like you.

296
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
I like you.

297
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
You're a hot-headed.

298
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
I saw my aunt yesterday.

299
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
You were unhappy at her house.

300
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Were you happy?

301
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
I remember when I moved to my uncle's house.

302
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
One night.

303
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
My aunt said something.

304
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
What?

305
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
My cousin was in college.

306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
He would come back after a while.

307
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Every time he came back.

308
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
My aunt would buy him soup.

309
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
And give him a body.

310
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
And then.

311
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,880
My cousin was called by the parents.

312
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
My aunt scolded me.

313
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
After he came back.

314
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
He would take my face.

315
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
He told my cousin.

316
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Your mom and I.

317
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
We need to buy him a body.

318
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
We need to finish it.

319
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
No.

320
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
I don't want to drink.

321
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
How can I finish it?

322
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Erzhen.

323
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
What's the point of drinking?

324
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
It's not good to drink.

325
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
But I didn't feel bad.

326
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
I felt like a passer-by.

327
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I heard that.

328
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Because I was a...

329
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,880
I won't tell you.

330
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
You said that.

331
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
You didn't study well.

332
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Why are you so stubborn?

333
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I tell you.

334
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
You threw my face.

335
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
What's so good about it?

336
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm annoyed.

337
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Yifan.

338
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,880
We really don't have much experience.

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
You need to listen to me.

340
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Don't know what's going on.

341
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Or I'll tell you how I'm going to die.

342
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Uncle is not a good girl.

343
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
But you need to know.

344
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
We don't have any good friends.

345
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Right?

346
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Hello, mom.

347
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
Can you give me a chance?

348
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
I think I will...

349
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,880
I will be good friends with this guy.

350
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,880
I will be good friends with Uncle Zhen.

351
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Uncle Zhen.

352
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I'll take you back.

353
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Don't cry, Ajing.

354
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm telling you.

355
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
No matter what,

356
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
you can't meet him soon.

357
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
I'm sorry.

358
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Mom, I'm back.

359
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Ajing, what's the matter?

360
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
I can talk to Uncle.

361
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Uncle said I'm going to hang up.

362
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
So I was...

363
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
a person who would give up everything.

364
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
But I don't need to.

365
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm fine with it.

366
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Diandian,

367
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
you don't need to care about these things.

368
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
I don't think

369
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
what I said is right.

370
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,880
I just saw those little dresses.

371
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Or some cakes.

372
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
I will hesitate for a long time.

373
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
I can't bear to give them to myself.

374
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I can't afford it.

375
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
I just feel that

376
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
those expensive things

377
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
are all wasted on me.

378
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Sang Yan,

379
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
are you sure he doesn't like you?

380
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Don't you think it's strange?

381
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
He is not rich.

382
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Why would he be with someone?

383
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I'm pretty sure.

384
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Because I'm not good to him.

385
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
I've never felt that it's good to always be good to you.

386
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
abbard!

387
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
You can't have someone.

388
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
I didn't know

389
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
teachers are like this

390
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
because you're on such a small diet.

391
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I should be the one responsible.

392
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
I know.

394
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,360
But,

395
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,000
Later,

396
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,640
I feel build-up.

397
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,400
부1517 nov.

398
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,360
Finally,

399
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,160
that part of you was left

400
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,880
by me

401
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,920
Wext какое l' bezel?

402
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,040
You can only say

403
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,200
you hurt her!

404
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
Forget it.

405
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,600
How long?

406
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,040
It's not too late to apologize.

407
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,200
Your mouth is on you.

408
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,760
You can say whatever you want.

409
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
This is your right.

410
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Then is it his right

411
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
to accept or not?

412
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
No.

413
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'm back.

414
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Sorry.

415
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm sorry.

418
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I said something wrong.

420
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
This is your right.

421
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
Did your house get renovated?

422
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Did you go to see the situation?

423
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
How is it?

424
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
The house hasn't been installed yet.

425
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Even if it's installed,

426
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
it needs to be renovated.

427
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I guess it takes a while

428
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
to move in.

429
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Then you won't move in a month?

430
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Yes.

431
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
You are my best friend.

432
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I can't lose you.

433
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
You don't have to be so happy.

434
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
What's wrong with him?

435
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I guess he's hungry.

436
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
By the way,

437
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
there's a multi-faceted chicken soup on the table.

438
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Help me drink it.

439
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
What's this?

440
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
What's this?

441
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm sure it's a double-edged sword.

442
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
But I look like a dreamer.

443
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Maybe I don't know much about it.

444
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
But double-edged sword

445
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
is a character

446
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
that suddenly comes to

447
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
someone else's body.

448
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Sometimes it's like being revived.

449
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
It's different from normal actions.

450
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
Even eyes and behavior.

451
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
But dreamers don't know.

452
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Dreamers

453
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
do some meaningless behavior

454
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
in the familiar space

455
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,200
when they are sleeping.

456
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm not sure.

457
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm not sure.

458
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Why are you so clear?

459
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Because I used to be a dreamer.

460
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
My dad started dreaming

461
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
after he passed away.

462
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
My uncle had a dream.

463
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
He even scared them.

464
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
He had a dream

465
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
when he was in college.

466
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
But I didn't have a dream.

467
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
How did you know

468
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
you didn't have a dream?

469
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
No one mentioned it to me.

470
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
You didn't mention

471
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
the things that you did together.

472
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I had a short time with you.

473
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
No one mentioned

474
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
the things

475
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
you did in the city.

476
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
I was in the south

477
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
after I got the job.

478
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I didn't have

479
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
such experience before.

480
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Have I ever been in front of you?

481
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Me?

482
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
You were in front of me.

483
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I was in front of you.

484
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
I was in front of you.

485
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I was in front of you.

486
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I was.

487
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
I was in front of you.

488
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I was in front of you.

489
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
I was in front of you.

490
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
So,

491
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
after you came back

492
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
last night,

493
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
did you see me?

494
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
What did I do?

495
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I just went back to my room.

496
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Sorry, I scared you.

497
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Wei Yi Fan.

498
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
What can I do

499
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
as a man?

500
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Besides,

501
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
I'm not afraid of anything.

502
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
That's good.

503
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Actually,

504
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
when I was in the dormitory in college,

505
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I was scared

506
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
to go to the toilet in the middle of the night.

507
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
So, I didn't dare to sleep

508
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
for a few days.

509
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I was afraid I would scare others.

510
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
But he said

511
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
I wouldn't do anything

512
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
when I was in the dream.

513
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Don't worry.

514
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Because of this,

515
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
you can help me to be an air-conditioner.

516
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Actually, as long as I sleep well,

517
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I won't be in the dream.

518
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I won't bring you any impact.

519
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
I...

520
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I...

521
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I don't know anything else.

522
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
However,

523
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I don't know anything else.

524
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I don't know anything else.

525
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
I don't know.

526
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I don't know.

527
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I think I saw you for the first time.

528
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Of course,

529
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
not.

530
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Anything else?

531
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
One more time.

532
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
What's wrong with that?

533
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What's wrong with that?

534
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I remember.

535
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I remember.

536
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
What?

537
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,040
You cannot

538
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,040
kiss me

539
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,120
It's too red

540
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

541
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,400
My head is blushing

542
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,120
Are you okay

543
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,520
Is it

544
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Something wrong with you?

545
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,440
Could it be sugar- discussions?

546
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Yeah, it's not

547
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,240
Who tastes the sauce less?

548
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Scream

549
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Is this thing your exaggeration?

550
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,280
Is it possible that I accidentally hit you when I came out of the dream?

551
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,840
And then I got some physical contact?

552
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,600
You mean I intentionally blacked you?

553
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,560
I didn't mean that.

554
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,720
Meifan, I'm the one who was taken advantage of.

555
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,280
Why are you trying to mock me?

556
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,560
Why didn't you tell me about such a thing?

557
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,480
No?

558
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,080
What does that mean?

559
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
What does that mean?

560
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
Did you find out anything?

561
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm sorry.

562
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,800
It's okay. You said it, too.

563
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
It's a special period.

564
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
I'm not careful.

565
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,800
What is this?

566
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,920
This...

567
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,000
It's a dream.

568
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yes.

569
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,800
May I ask you a question?

571
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Yes.

572
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,280
Where did I ask you?

573
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,520
What about being a crew member?

574
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,880
I have to go.

575
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,160
So he confesses absolutely.

576
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
Never mind.

577
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,080
Never mind.

578
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,320
Just don't want to varuage orNot.

579
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
It's related to me.

580
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,080
I'll forgive you.

581
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,120
Never mind.

582
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,680
Let's start over again.

583
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,840
I'll take advantage of you.

584
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,720
Can you stand up for a while?

585
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,680
Don't worry.

586
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
I won't touch you.

587
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
I just want to prove it.

588
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
I think this thing

589
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,520
might be a little low.

590
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
Naturally, it's OK.

591
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Otherwise,

592
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,840
I'd say you're not very good.

593
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,700
I really can't touch it.

594
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,500
Is there some stigma

595
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,440
Has it even got stuck?

596
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,240
Or,

597
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,620
she's right at the word against me?

598
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,920
Pei Keeper

599
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,560
Le designated as high school junior

600
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:59,600
Resident, Jia

601
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
You really don't have a reason to lie to me.

602
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,600
But these things are really not my control.

603
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Next time, if you have this kind of situation,

604
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
just give me a punch.

605
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Give you a punch?

606
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,600
You can stand it.

607
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Anyway, you are always good at it.

608
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,600
No, you should protect yourself.

609
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm so tired.

610
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
I'm so tired.

611
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
The End

612
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Life is under pressure.

613
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Emotion is under pressure.

614
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
The scar on the wound is very painful.

615
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
The scar is very painful.

616
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
I mean the scar on the wound is the scar in my heart.

617
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
The End

618
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Life is under pressure.

619
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,600
The End

620
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
It's okay.

621
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I was right about the mirror yesterday.

622
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,600
The End

623
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Dad,

624
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Shuang Jiang came to see you.

625
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,600
He also brought you your favorite chili soup.

626
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
I'll give it to you now.

627
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
It's still that taste.

628
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
If you still want to eat it,

629
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
just give it to me.

630
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Dad,

631
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
are you alone?

632
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm doing well now.

633
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I miss you a little.

634
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Mom is doing well too.

635
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Uncle Zhen is good to me too.

636
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Dad, don't worry.

637
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Shuang Jiang will take good care of himself.

638
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Goodbye, Ding Dian.

639
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Goodbye, Xiao Qiao.

640
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
I hope that next time,

641
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
we can be like the old Iron Mountain Bridge.

642
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Dad,

643
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I'm coming.

644
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Are you scared?

645
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm fine.

646
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Shuang Jiang,

647
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,600
hug me tightly.

648
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Take care of yourself.

649
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Bye.

650
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I'm happy now.

651
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Hug me tightly.

652
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Not more than ten o'clock.

653
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I didn't send any messages.

654
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
Where are you going? It's so late.

655
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Haven't you eaten yet?

656
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Not yet.

657
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I bought chicken soup.

658
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Try it.

659
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Chicken soup is especially delicious.

660
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Thank you.

661
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I'm afraid that I'll see you in the sea.

662
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:28,600
All the distance is a circle.

663
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I miss the place I used to go.

664
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,600
I'll wait for you to be careful.

665
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Be careful.

666
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Master,

667
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
let's start again.

668
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
I finally see me.

669
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
What's wrong?

671
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I am sorry.

673
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Shuang Jiang,

674
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,600
look at me.

675
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,640
Superb.

676
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Good.

677
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,560
It doesn't have to be a low note.

678
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,780
Keep going slowly.

679
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,800
Be pushy.

680
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,520
I like it.

681
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,080
Thanks.

682
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,960
I love it.

683
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,680
Thanks.

684
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,960
I'll let you know

685
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,040
something spiritual.

686
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm asking you this question.

687
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,100
Don't get mad.

688
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
I can feel the pain

689
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I want to draw the people who love you

690
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,100
I hide my tears in the mirror

691
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
But you still want to

692
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Staying in the world for a while

693
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
That's all

694
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Only asking

695
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Is a question to you

696
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,100
A question

697
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Feel the pain

698
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
Because I'm an object

699
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,580
Confused

700
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,340
For an hour or two.

701
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,020
Shen first.

702
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,340
I want to meet your daughter.

703
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,100
She was happy

704
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,700
this year.

705
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
I'm not afraid of you.

706
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,100
I'm not afraid of you.

707
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,100

I'm not afraid of you.

709
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100

711
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100

I'm not afraid of you.

721
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,100
I'm not afraid of you.

722

I'm not afraid of you.

760
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I'm not afraid of you.

761
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
I'm not afraid of you.

762
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,100
I'm not afraid of you.

763
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
I'm not afraid of your serious Close.

764
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
It's quiet.

765
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,620
Don't call out.

766
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,100
I want to be close to you

767
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,580
because you like me.

768
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,020
Ji Dong asked

769
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,100
to work,

770
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,100
but I handle Beiyan's matter.

771
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,100
ớihoo.

772
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
I want to fight.

773
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,600
People like you

774
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,600
are normal as well.

775
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
I do not like bad questions.

776
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,360
Many people expected

777
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,600
to try to be strongest.
