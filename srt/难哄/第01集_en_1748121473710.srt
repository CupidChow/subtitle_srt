1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,960
The world is so vast, you are the only one who can be human

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate makes us meet

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Maybe it's because of you, I'm so worried about you

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so worried that I can't be with you

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
I've decided to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
I want to understand everything, and become a memory

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,200
All the storms and storms are for the rest of my life

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,600
It's for you, for you to be brave

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,200
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Even if there's someone at the end, I'll keep my word

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm not afraid of the world, I'm afraid of you

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm holding you, holding you

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,400
I've loved you before

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Wei Fan, am I your backup?

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Yes, you are.

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,420
а

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,360
Bye

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,560
Bye

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
It's too close.

21
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
It's okay. It's too late.

22
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Dad.

23
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
How can we get there?

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
All of you.

25
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Dad.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Dad.

27
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Dad.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Dad.

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Dad.

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Dad.

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Dad.

32
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Dad.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Dad.

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Dad.

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Dad.

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Dad.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Dad.

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Dad.

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Dad.

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Be careful.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
It's pretty fast.

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
What's going on?

43
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
What's going on?

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Get down.

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Hurry up.

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Open the car.

47
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Get down.

48
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Hurry up.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Put it down.

50
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Put it back.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
It's too heavy to carry a car.

52
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Put it back.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Back.

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
It's a South-West store.

55
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I remember it.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
It's too much for you to compare.

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
What should we do?

58
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
The protection is important.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Wei Yufan.

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,200
No matter how good you did in the Japanese newspaper,

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
if you can't get used to it,

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
You can give it to me when the time is up.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
What's that sound?

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Get off.

66
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Get in the car.

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I don't need to take my phone.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
It's important to save people.

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Or to report it to the police?

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Hello.

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
We've got a car.

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm at the Hongmang Road in the border area.

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Please come here.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll take it.

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I'll take it.

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Give me your hand.

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'll give it to you.

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Be careful.

80
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Don't move.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You're dead, right?

82
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Be careful.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Okay.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
What are you doing?

85
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
What do you mean?

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Why should I wash my clothes?

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
I didn't want to wash them with you.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I just wanted to grab them.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
And don't you think I'm afraid of you?

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You're always working in the east.

91
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
You're not eating dinner.

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Pleasure & Kiss

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Luo Xia!

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,240
Hello?

95
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,800
Waiter.

96
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,240
통는 전ستought语.

97
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,400
Jing...

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,960
Please call him.

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Hello, Xiao Qiao.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,480
You've finally connected.

101
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
Do you know who I just hit?

102
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,160
I hit my classmate's desk in high school.

103
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Then the bad guy in theibation home.

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,720
Both.

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
That's right.

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
I kicked my ass.

107
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,080
You've been pissed off

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,120
from class to this age.

109
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,680
months old

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,040
It's so embarrassing to die so decorate the table.

111
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm afraid you'll be wrong.

112
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,040
My friend said that he's the most handsome man in the street.

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Why are you so handsome?

114
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Min Shu, you just woke up.

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
It's 2 o'clock. Where were you yesterday?

116
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I was in college.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I'll take you to a handsome man.

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
A hot man.

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I don't have money to see a man.

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Just a handsome man?

121
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
That's settled then.

122
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,040
See you tonight.

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Bye.

124
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Are you sure this is a shop?

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
We didn't find it since we got here.

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,040
People like to have fun here.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Relax, lie down, and live a good life.

128
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,040
No wonder this is called the restaurant.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Look.

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Work.

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
You're so considerate.

132
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
What a nice name.

133
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
It's the protection umbrella of the staff.

134
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
When I call you tonight,

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
you'll say I'm at work.

136
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
You're so considerate.

137
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Yeah, no wonder we didn't find it.

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Let's go.

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Let me see.

140
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Go in.

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Okay.

142
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,040
It's a housekeeper's housekeeper.

143
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Is the boss not here?

144
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Hello, what do you need?

145
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
No need.

146
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
We can come by ourselves.

147
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Okay, whatever you need.

148
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Just order at Samba.

149
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Okay.

150
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I was wondering what the service was like.

151
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
No way.

152
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,040
The boss here can say it's the boss of Samba Street.

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,040
This one should be good.

154
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
By the way,

155
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I told you today

156
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I met a guy on the way.

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
He's the deputy manager of our high school.

158
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
He was a student in Nanwu University.

159
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
And Sang Yan, a classmate of yours.

160
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
But I didn't see him for a long time.

161
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
You're still a student.

162
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Look, is that Samba's boss?

163
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
No, he's a fool.

164
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Come and have a look.

165
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Look.

166
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Isn't that...

167
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Look, look.

168
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
That handsome guy in the back.

169
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
What's going on?

170
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
Stop looking. Let's go.

171
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Sorry, sorry.

172
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Why are you so careless?

173
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
It's okay, it's okay.

174
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I'll go and clean up the bathroom.

175
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
You should be able to wash it.

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,040
It's okay, it's okay.

178
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Sorry.

179
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
It's okay, it's okay.

180
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
I just saw you.

181
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Hello.

182
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Hello.

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Director.

184
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm the boss of the class.

185
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Sang.

186
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
You didn't recognize me.

187
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I'm sorry

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
because our mistakes

189
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
caused you trouble and inconvenience.

190
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
You can tell me if you need anything.

191
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Besides,

192
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
all the expenses in the store tonight

193
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
are all on me.

194
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
I hope it won't affect your good mood.

195
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
It seems that you really didn't recognize me.

196
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
It's okay, it's okay.

197
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,040
Then, Shi Pei.

198
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Sang.

199
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
I have to pretend that I don't know you.

200
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
The first row.

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Your clothes.

202
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Sang.

203
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
The first row.

204
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Sorry.

205
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
We are here for the formalities.

206
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,040
It's a pity.

207
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm quite happy to wear my clothes.

208
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
It seems that I have more work to do than you.

209
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I'll take it back and be your manager.

210
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I'm back.

211
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
I met the boss in the toilet.

212
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
He said

213
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
he really said that?

214
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Why didn't he let you

215
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
take it back home and show it to me?

216
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
That's what he meant.

217
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
But don't mind him.

218
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
We need to order.

219
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
After all, it's a sign.

220
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
Do you want to see the sign?

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
It's still...it's still true.

222
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
I saw it.

223
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
We need to order here.

224
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
What are you laughing at?

225
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Why is there someone next to you?

226
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Why is the epidemic so good?

227
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Hello.

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
This is your drink

229
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
and the money you need to return.

230
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
What do you mean?

231
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
It was my fault.

233
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
The boss has already told me.

234
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
You can take the bill.

235
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
You are still so serious.

236
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Take it back first.

237
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
It's okay.

238
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,040
It's normal for you to drink wine.

239
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Thank you.

240
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Thank you.

241
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Where is the boss?

242
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
I'll go get the wine.

243
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I'll get it.

244
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Yan,

245
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
this may not be the money for the payment.

246
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,040
I just heard these two guests talking about it.

247
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
You forgot the purpose of coming here.

248
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Look at the date.

249
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
How can you match his mood?

250
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
This may be for you.

251
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I'll get it.

252
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Xiao Fei.

253
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Yan, do you want to get it?

254
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I'll go get it first.

255
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
Boss, what's going on?

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
You haven't reached the point

257
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
where you are so close to us, right?

258
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
I'll go get it.

259
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
What's going on?

260
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Dian Dian,

261
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
I'm used to living in that room.

262
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Although the environment is not very good,

263
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
but it's more convenient to stay in the classroom.

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
It's better for you to work.

265
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
If Gao Zhong didn't

266
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
break up with him at that time,

267
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
what would I do now?

268
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
Will he be happier

269
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
and more brave than now?

270
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Is there any other me

271
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
in this world?

272
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
In the parallel universe,

273
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
he has gone a completely different path from me.

274
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
If we meet here,

275
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I don't know what Dian Yike will do to me.

276
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
Dian Yike,

277
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
do you hear me?

278
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Remember?

279
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
I said

280
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
I'll get you that room.

281
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Do you still like it?

282
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Not bad.

283
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Not bad?

284
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I'll go to the station.

285
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Take care of the security.

286
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
I'll send you a message later.

287
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Bye.

288
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Take care.

289
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

290
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

291
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,640
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

292
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

293
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

294
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

295
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

296
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

297
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

298
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm afraid that I'll be too late.

299
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm afraid that you'll be too late.

300
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,040
I'll be in the sea of people.

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,040
Before the rain, every scene

302
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,040
is white and familiar.

303
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Why is the name on the lock?

304
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,040
You're too late to be late.

305
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm really not late.

306
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
I'll get up first.

307
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Okay, you go first.

308
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Come on, let's go.

309
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
What's this?

310
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
It's a long-sleeved shirt.

311
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,040
It's all a long-sleeved shirt.

312
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Don't be so old.

313
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
I'm old.

314
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
I'm old.

315
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
What's the difference?

316
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm just a little older than you.

317
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
You're so old.

318
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm warning you.

319
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Don't be like this.

320
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,040
You should go back first.

322
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Let's go now.

323
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Let's go.

324
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's go now.

325
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Let's visit Hong Kong to star.

326
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Let's go home now, okay?

327
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
You're early.

328
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,840
Which one is the usual one?

329
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
The first one.

330
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,360
I've checked the art form

331
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,640
and haven't seen the bracelet.

332
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,560
Xiao Zhuo, come here.

333
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,560
The beauty is sitting over there.

334
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,160
Did you see a bracelet?

335
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,400
I bumped into you on the spot.

336
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,840
It's a long time since I've seen it.

338
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,680
When she took the clothes,

339
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
she took the bracelet with her.

340
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,120
It's okay.

341
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
I'll leave it to you.

342
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,280
Okay.

343
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,400
You can write it here.

344
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,880
I'm the bartender here, He Ming Wu.

345
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
If you have any questions,

346
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
you can come to me.

347
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,960
I'll contact you when I find it.

348
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
Bu Zi Xin

349
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,640
came to contact me specially.

350
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,360
Yan, she dropped a bracelet yesterday.

351
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,400
But she won't leave.

352
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,920
She's not a guest.

353
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,720
Maybe.

354
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,240
I've seen art form everyday.

355
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,120
I don't have a bracelet.

356
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,560
Are you getting old?

357
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
How could you say that?

358
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,400
I see it everyday.

359
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,160
How could you say that?

360
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,880
What?

361
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,680
What?

362
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,600
What?

363
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,480
What?

364
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,080
Is this one?

365
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:47,880
Thank you.

366
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,440
You're welcome.

367
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,440
Isn't it a gift?

368
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,080
No.

369
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:57,880
Yes.

370
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,480
It's a gift.

371
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,280
It's a gift.

372
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,080
It's a gift.

373
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,880
It's a gift.

374
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,520
It's a gift.

375
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,080
It's a gift.

376
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,720
It's a gift.

377
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,440
It's a gift.

378
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,160
Yes.

379
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,520
I found the bracelet.

380
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,120
Thank you.

381
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,880
I sent it to you.

382
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll find you another day.

383
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,840
I'll go to the restaurant.

384
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,400
Bye.

385
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,960
Bye.

386
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,240
I'll go buy potades.

387
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,960
Do you have something to eat?

388
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
I really have to go to the supermarket for energy drinks.

389
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:47,800
No need.

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Thanks.

391
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Bye.

392
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,240
Stop pushing!

393
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,540
What's this kid doing?

394
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,440
Don't you know what he is thinking?

395
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,040
Of course he has files.

396
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,240
Did you think I'm his mom or色's mom?

397
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,440
Kopi, you have no idea what I raised.

398
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,740
If my mother and my son become two- ум's,

399
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,840
she'll scold me for nothing.

400
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
You can't believe it.

401
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,880
What did you do?

402
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,040
No one will care about you

403
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,200
What are you doing?

404
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
I just want to protect you

405
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Look at you

406
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm not going to let you go

407
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,080
Let me go

408
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,760
Let me go

409
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
Don't go

410
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,520
Let me go

411
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,480
You are so stupid

412
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,560
I will kill you

413
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,360
I will kill you

414
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,680
They hit me

415
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
You hurt my heart

416
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,240
I will kill you

417
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,360
I am a prison guard

418
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
A prison guard

419
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,040
You are a prison guard

420
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,920
You hurt me

421
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,520
They all live in the prison

422
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,120
You

423
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,520
Miss Wen

424
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,360
Don't worry

425
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Our colleague

426
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,960
Just went to your kitchen to check the name

427
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,560
No one is in the scene

428
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,920
You can rest assured

429
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,840
If you are worried

430
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,120
Shall we send a police officer

431
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
To escort you home

432
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,400
No need

433
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,960
Thank you

434
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,560
Mister

435
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:17,040
You don't need

436
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
You are an puppet

437
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Nothing will control you

438
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,280
I just get enough sleep...

439
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,560
...to help her wake up.

440
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,940
It's nice to resign.

441
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,060
Let's sleep less.

442
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,120
She lies down.

443
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm going to rely on myself.

444
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
Mom, what's the fault of the water?

445
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Is it my fault?

446
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Is it my fault?

447
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Dianjian.

448
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Qiaoqiao.

449
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Why are you so late?

450
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
I'm here to deliver the bracelet.

451
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Come in.

452
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Dianjian is here.

453
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,040
Aunt.

454
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Come on, eat some fruits.

455
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
You're here.

456
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Hello, hello.

457
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Hello, hello.

458
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
Come in.

459
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Are you really okay?

460
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Can I take care of you tonight?

461
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
Of course.

462
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
Take it easy.

463
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Mom.

464
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
I need to go.

465
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
You're still waiting for me in the car?

466
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Let's go to have a talk with mom.

467
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
I'm calling you right now.

468
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
I'll call you right after I go home.

469
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Mom.

470
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm begging you.

471
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm begging you.

472
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,440
Can you please save me?

473
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,840
Don't leave me.

474
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,040
You're so young.

475
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640
Come out quickly.

476
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,040
I can't stand it anymore.

477
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,240
You're standing in the toilet.

478
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
How can you stand there?

479
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,040
I want to eat too.

480
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Come on.

481
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
Yifan, come out and have breakfast.

482
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,840
Good morning, sister.

483
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
Good morning, sister.

484
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,040
Good morning.

485
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Yifan, you're awake.

486
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,640
Come out and have breakfast.

487
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,240
Let's go.

488
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Let's eat.

489
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Sit here.

490
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,840
Okay.

491
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Let's eat.

492
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,440
You too.

493
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,040
Come on.

494
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,240
Let's go.

495
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Don't be afraid.

496
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm telling you.

497
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,440
You'll be out soon in the toilet.

498
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,040
Okay.

499
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,440
I know.

500
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,040
Remember.

501
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,240
You two work fast.

502
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
Why are you sitting in my position again?

503
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,240
Sit over there.

504
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,040
Hurry up.

505
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,240
Yifan, eat.

506
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,440
Eat as you like.

507
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,240
Thank you, aunt.

508
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
You're so good.

509
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,640
You're so good.

510
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,440
Come on.

511
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,040
Yifan, don't drink this.

512
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,640
Don't be so romantic.

513
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Hurry up.

514
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
I'm so happy to be with you.

515
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,440
What's the matter?

516
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
If you keep eating,

517
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
you won't be able to eat.

518
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,840
In the future,

519
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
you should stay at home.

520
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,240
Auntie, I make breakfast for you every day.

521
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,440
Thank you, aunt.

522
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,640
You're so good at studying.

523
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,040
You're good at work.

524
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,640
Don't be so romantic.

525
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,440
Hello?

526
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Sister,

527
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
I'm sure that

528
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,840
Mr. Qian and I

529
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,040
will be at the table today.

530
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm already here.

531
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,040
I know.

532
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,240
Hurry up.

533
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,840
Here we are.

534
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
Here we are.

535
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
What's going on?

536
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,640
No.

537
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,840
Congratulations, Yifan.

538
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Congratulations on your victory.

539
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,040
Congratulations.

540
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,640
Congratulations.

541
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Congratulations, Yifan.

542
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
Hurry up.

543
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,840
Thank you.

544
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,240
What do you mean?

545
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,040
Yifan,

546
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,640
the news

547
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,040
is as good as your name.

548
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,840
It's not annoying.

549
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,040
You're the leading role today.

550
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Lin Ling,

551
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,240
interview her later.

552
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,440
Okay.

553
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,840
As the first person today,

554
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,440
okay.

555
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,840
We got the car accident a few days ago.

556
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
I'm Yifan.

557
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,840
This final exam

558
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,640
is to show you

559
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
that you're not afraid of

560
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,840
the car accident.

561
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
You're the leading role.

562
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,840
You deserve a big applause.

563
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,240
Okay.

564
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Congratulations.

565
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,240
This is for our South China TV station.

566
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,640
Yifan,

567
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
can you describe

568
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,840
the scene?

569
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Tell me.

570
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,640
How did you

571
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
get the driver's license?

572
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,440
Well,

573
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
maybe I was the one

574
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
who was worried about Yongqi.

575
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
I didn't know

576
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,240
where she was when she was in the majority.

577
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,040
I was the one who was worried.

578
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,840
You were the one who was worried.

579
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,640
So,

580
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
you came here on your own.

581
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,440
I was...

582
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Yifan,

583
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,640
can you tell me

584
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
how you got the big courage?

585
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Well,

586
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,440
I was worried.

587
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,040
It's okay.

588
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,640
Well,

589
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,440
get ready.

590
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
I'll interview you later.

591
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,640
Comrade,

592
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
can I interview you?

593
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Sure.

594
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Let's go this way.

595
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,640
Please help me

596
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
to get the big courage.

597
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Okay, teacher Qi.

598
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,840
You're going with me

599
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,240
to the live broadcast this year?

600
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
Can I stay here?

601
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
You still want to leave?

602
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,040
Everyone,

603
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
let me announce that

604
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
this year's live broadcast

605
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,240
is planned by C-group.

606
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
The other groups will cooperate.

607
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,240
Did you hear that?

608
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,800
집送金速上

609
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,240
We have resources.

610
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,640
Fan An,

611
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,840
stand up.

612
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,000
Stand up.

613
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Be careful.

614
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,600
That's not aはい.

615
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,720
aa

616
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,080

617
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,360
Thank you

618
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,920
Here

619
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,440
You schneller

620
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,800
Thank you

621
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,520
Do not hesitate

622
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,760
I listened to hö

623
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,900
I heard that many people being�

624
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,320
Force

625
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,240
Die

626
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,620
spicy

627
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,400
What the hell are you waiting for

628
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,280
Who is Mire

629
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,960
This can't be

630
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,020
I don't know

631
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Let's get in the car.

632
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,820
But have you ever heard of Mo Fei's engagement?

633
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,020
The more you don't want to happen,

634
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,420
the more likely it is.

635
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,820
Today is the holiday.

636
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,420
I believe all the miracles will happen.

637
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,620
What are you doing in the office?

638
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,020
What's wrong, Yifan?

639
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
You don't feel well?

640
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,420
Did you really meet an old love?

641
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
Don't always think about the old love.

642
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,820
Hurry up.

643
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
It's already late.

644
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,020
He's here too.

645
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,220
Is it here?

646
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,620
It's here.

647
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,820
It should be right in front of us.

648
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,220
Did you see me just now?

649
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,620
Nightly micro-sum,

650
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
a special occasion for the New Year.

651
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,020
Three-street wine,

652
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,620
free for women.

653
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,220
Miss, do you want to have a drink?

654
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Free for women.

655
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,020
Little brother, you should have a drink too.

656
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,220
Why are you wearing this?

657
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
What's wrong with this?

658
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
You're going to get both ugly tonight.

659
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,620
Do you want to try it?

660
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,420
It's good to drink.

661
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,620
No, I'm not.

662
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,020
Do you have a mask?

663
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,220
What's wrong?

664
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,820
I forgot to bring it.

665
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,220
I have it.

666
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Here you are.

667
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Is it cold?

668
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
It's not that cold.

669
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
A little bit.

670
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
It's warm.

671
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,020
You're still nice to me.

672
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
I'll go back to work.

673
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
I'll call you when it's over.

674
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
Happy New Year.

675
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Happy New Year.

676
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Nightly micro-sum.

677
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
Everyone, hurry up and get ready.

678
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
The New Year is about to start.

679
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
Time is running out.

680
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
Come with me.

681
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,020
I don't know if you can hurry up.

682
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
Go find a chance.

683
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,020
Sister, I'm going to the bathroom.

684
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,020
I'll be back soon.

685
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,020
Okay, okay.

686
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Go ahead.

687
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
What a long queue.

688
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
How about you wait here?

689
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
I'll go find you.

690
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
I'll go find your mom.

691
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Someone else is waiting for you at the bathroom.

692
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
There are so many people.

693
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
Please protect her.

694
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Besides,

695
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
I want to spend the rest of my life with your dad.

696
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
So why did you ask me to come?

697
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
To bring you a baby?

698
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
You should have this role.

699
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
I don't know why you're so stubborn.

700
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
You should have asked Mr. Jing

701
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
to find a reason to let you come.

702
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Just in time.

703
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
You can talk to him.

704
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
I think he has a high-level recently.

705
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
He must be under a lot of pressure.

706
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
He's got a lot of income.

707
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
Okay, I'll go find him.

708
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,020
Xiao Gui.

709
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
What?

710
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,020
I heard you've been under a lot of pressure.

711
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
No.

712
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
You should have done it.

713
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
I said no.

714
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
I was wondering why.

715
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,020
You didn't study

716
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,020
and didn't take the exam.

717
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
You went to university last night.

718
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
I think you're not as good as me.

719
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,020
You can't do it.

720
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
You can't help me.

721
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,020
Ziyang Yan is actually threatening me.

722
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,020
I gave him a lot of blessings and news.

723
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
He never came back.

724
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,020
I thought he didn't need this WeChat.

725
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
I didn't get it.

726
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
So it's not a punishment.

727
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
He really blackmailed me.

728
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
You don't listen to me, do you?

729
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
Come on.

730
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
I'll talk to your sister.

731
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
When do I have a sister?

732
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
Jia Xu, happy new year.

733
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
Zijun, happy new year.

734
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
You're so sweet.

735
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Take it for me.

736
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Sorry.

737
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,020
I'm sorry.

739
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
I'm sorry.

740
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Sorry.

741
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
Hello, Mr. Wei.

742
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Thank you.

743
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
How is it?

744
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Sister.

745
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
What?

746
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
If you come back late,

747
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
you'll see my body in the East.

748
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Thank you.

749
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
I'm really sorry.

750
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
I'm sorry.

751
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
I'm sorry.

752
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I'm sorry.

753
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
I'm sorry.

754
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
I'm sorry.

755
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,020
I'm sorry.

757
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
Thank you.

758
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,020
I'm so sorry.

759
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
I'm so cold.

760
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,020
Here, take your hand.

761
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Thank you, sister.

762
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
You'll be the only one to be picked up later.

763
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,020
Okay.

764
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,020
The location of the reporter is the

765
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,020
beloved square of the Golden Age Square.

766
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,020
You can see that it's getting closer and closer.

767
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
There are many people gathered here.

768
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,020
Looking forward to the new year.

769
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Today, we're lucky to have a director

770
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,020
who is related to the show.

771
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,020
Can you tell us

772
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
the meaning of this project?

773
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
Can you tell us about the new year?

774
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
Good thing is not to worry.

775
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
I hope you can be my girlfriend.

776
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,020
You really said that

777
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,020
you're not afraid of being seen by your parents.

778
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Sister Xiao Yi,

779
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
can I repeat the same thing?

780
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
The new year is coming soon.

781
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Can you tell us about the new year?

782
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,020
Can you play games with me?

783
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Can you play games with me?

784
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
What is this new year?

785
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
It's so beautiful.

786
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
I can't play games with you.

787
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Did you see that?

788
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,020
The big group is starting soon.

789
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
You should hurry up and take some special photos.

790
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Okay, thank you.

791
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Happy new year.

792
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020

You're welcome.

794
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
I'll go now.

795
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Four, nine, eight,

796
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
three, two, one.

797
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Six, five, four, three,

798
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,020
two, one.

799
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,020
Happy new year.

00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
Happy new year.

810
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
Happy new year.

811
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020
You're so funny.

812
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
Happy new year.

You're giving me a blessing.

815
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
Don't be so self-conscious.

816
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,020
I'll give you a blessing.

817
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
Brother,

818
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
I'm sure you'll be fine.

819
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,020

820
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,020
