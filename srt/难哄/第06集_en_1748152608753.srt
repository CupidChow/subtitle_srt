1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
with you.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with you.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
with you.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
with you.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to live a life of peace

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
with you.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've loved you before.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Love is a Dream

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mei Fan. Mei Fan.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your mother called me. She wants you to go to the hospital now.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Your father...

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Slow down.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Be careful.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mei Fan. Mei Fan.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Your mother called me. She wants you to go to the hospital now.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Your father...

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your mother...

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your mother...

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your mother...

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Your mother...

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Your mother...

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sorry.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Please call again when you're done.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Please call again when you're done.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sorry.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sorry.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sorry.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I suddenly didn't want to go to the hospital.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I wanted to try running away.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I wanted to try running away.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I wanted to try running away.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I wanted to try running away.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wanted to try running away.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I wanted to try running away.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I wanted to try running away.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I wanted to try running away.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I wanted to try running away.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I wanted to try running away.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I wanted to try running away.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I wanted to try running away.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I wanted to try running away.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I wanted to try running away.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I wanted to try running away.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I wanted to try running away.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I wanted to try running away.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I wanted to try running away.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I wanted to try running away.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I wanted to try running away.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I wanted to try running away.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I wanted to try running away.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I wanted to try running away.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I wanted to try running away.

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I wanted to try running away.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I wanted to try running away.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I wanted to try running away.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wanted to try running away.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I wanted to try running away.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,420
Free What

71
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,420
What is it?

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,100
I've never been this beautiful.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Anyway, in general,

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
everyone's work this year is still good.

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Let's not rush it.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I hope everyone can work hard again next year.

77
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
It's the first year of the year.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Who will stay for the job this year?

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Does anyone take the initiative to invite me to look at the work?

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not going to talk, right?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fine. Then I'll just order.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Su Tian.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Teacher Qian, I...

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, right, I forgot.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then you can have a good rest.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you, Teacher Qian.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Zhenyu, I remember your home is a male dance.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't have to go to the outside.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
How about taking care of you?

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Teacher Qian, I've already bought a ticket.

91
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's been a year since I went to Haidan.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My little dress is also good.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You went to Haidan in the New Year?

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then you are so rich.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not expensive to buy it in advance.

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Fu Zhuang, don't hide.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've seen you.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Teacher Qian, I haven't been back for two years.

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll go with you.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you, Teacher Qian.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wu Ming.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Teacher Qian, I'll be back this year.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll be back to my hometown this year.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My mother and I have made an appointment.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You won't be back before the New Year's Day.

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just go back.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll write some notes on your stuff in the fridge.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Teacher Qian, I can stay for a while.

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have nothing to do.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Look, look.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Look at Yifan's talent.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can learn from him.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yifan, thank you for your hard work.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, okay. Don't be busy.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Your brother is busy with his life.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You won't be back in the New Year?

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay, okay.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll buy some drinks.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Su Hao An.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Su Hao An, you are so mean.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Su Hao An.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Su Hao An.

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come here.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you so mean?

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's wrong?

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why are you calling me?

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you going to give me a single?

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Of course not.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What else do you want to eat?

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can pretend to be your girlfriend.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Pretend to be your girlfriend?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We are just a couple.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Everyone, go to have a drink.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's okay.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why are you so loud?

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Where are you going?

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm going upstairs.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Say it.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Have some water first.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Take a bath.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Say it.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What's the matter?

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
My grandma is fighting with me.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
She has been out for a year.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If she doesn't bring a future grandson,

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
she won't come back to the New Year.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I'm thinking of her.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I refuse.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I haven't finished yet.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Aren't you just pretending to be your girlfriend?

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

155
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't accept it.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why?

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's embarrassing.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I never accept the fact that I'm pretending to be my girlfriend.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You should be my best friend.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are the one who is embarrassed.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Can I be your best friend?

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Look.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Who is this hooker?

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's my brother.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's my uncle.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I said that it's okay to be your best friend.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But who is your best friend?

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you pretending to be your girlfriend?

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What?

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You said that you would drink with someone else.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are so mean.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I will be the one who is embarrassed.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She will be mad.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You should cancel it.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well,

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you can take the car.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll take it if you don't.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll take it.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay. Thank you.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I want to be your best friend first.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't do anything for you.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't do anything.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's go.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll go to the restaurant and have dinner.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll drink with you.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I said that it's not okay.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's go.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Five,

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
four,

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
three,

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
two, one.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you okay, sister?

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm fine.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Who wants to be the red one?

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Come on.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Come on.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't be shy.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't be shy.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come on.

204
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Take this.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll go get it.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're welcome.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't be shy.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Be careful.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yifan,

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
are you really okay?

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you need it,

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can come over anytime.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't worry, sister.

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can have a good rest.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Even if you don't rest,

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the baby will rest.

218
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You said that I'm a burden to my parents.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
if I'm right or wrong

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
for her decision.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm just a burden to my parents.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You said that

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
will the baby ask me

226
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
where her father is in the future?

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
don't think so much.

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The power of the baby

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is much more powerful than ours.

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the situation

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is different now.

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't be silly.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
My baby is touched.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I believe

237
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
you will give

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
a beautiful future to the baby.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Of course.

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't cry.

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Come on.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Come here.

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Come on.

244
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why are you crying?

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was touched by your heart.

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Look.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did someone bully you?

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come on.

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is for the baby.

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you.

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yifan,

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you've worked hard to eat.

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And I'm happy

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
every year.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you.

Even before go home, I'll say it.

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why are you so late a long time?

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,760
OK.

273
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Where is my office?

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,760
We're aloud in a few days.

I'm here.

276
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760
You can knock on my door.

277
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,160
You won't go home, too?

278
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,160
Is there anyone on the TV station?

279
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,560
It's hard to be alone.

280
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
Mom, take this.

281
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,160
No need. You're too polite.

282
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Don't be polite.

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm hungry.

284
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,560
Good boy. Go and have a look.

285
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm really not alone.

286
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,560
My daughter-in-law

287
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,960
has come to accompany me.

288
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,960
This,

289
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Miss,

290
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,360
you can eat it yourself.

291
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,960
Don't be polite to me.

292
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Eat for your children.

293
00:12:59,360 --> 00:12:59,760
Come on.

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
It's a bone.

295
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,160
I like it the most.

296
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Thank you, Miss.

297
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,960
Come and have a bite.

298
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
No, I'm busy.

299
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Happy new year.

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,360
Happy new year.

301
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,160
Have a look. What do you like the most?

302
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,160
I'll have one for you.

303
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
It's not good.

304
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
I like it the most.

305
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
I'm really not alone.

306
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Is the food ready?

307
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes.

308
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,160

Have a look.

310
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
The food is ready.

311
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
The ceremony is about to begin.

312
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,960
Get ready.

313
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,160
One, two, three.

314
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,560
Cheers.

315
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,560

Happy new year.

320
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,760
Why do you look so confused?

321
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,560
Grandpa.

322
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Welcome to the Spring Festival of the New Year.

323
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,560
Look.

Luo.

334
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,960
Luo.

335
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,440
Girls used to say that they got your name wrong every time.

336
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,800
But your beauty might be heard all over the world now.

337
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,280
We are now ten.

338
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,580
Yes, everybody said there's no money.

339
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,920
You didn't even ask your speed.

340
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,580
If I weren't native parents, it'd be so far back now in the neighborhood.

341
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,140
giggling

342
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,420

The taste of the dumplings.

357
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,540
I forgot to buy dumplings.

358
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,420

before leaving?

363
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,620
There are too many relatives in this house.

364
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,660
I can't seem to renew?

365
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,420

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,620
It's me.

369
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
What are you doing?

370
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,180
Let's eat.

371
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,180
It's time to wake up.

372
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,820
Yes.

373
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,180
Are you still in love?

374
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,900

It's all right.

379
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
Boil some ice in the microwave

380
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,840
and shipment.

381
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,960
You can leave it in the freezer.

382
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,960
Don't use a jar to put in

383
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,920
salt and sugar.

384
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960
Now put in ice bowls.

385
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,600
But this is just forgot instant noodles.

386
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
But when I've mixed them together with pickled chili sauce just now

387
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,120
I'll put in a little bit of salt

388
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,080
to mix it up

389
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,720
and don't worry

390
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,760
at all,

391
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,640
don't worry,

392
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,640
mix it wrongly.

393
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,480
OK.

394
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Boiling sitäok.

395
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,140
Boiling sitäok,

396
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,600
keep going,

397
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,120
keep going,

398
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,240
add salt later and put in

399
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,440
U.F.K.

400
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,280
Wei Fan.

401
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,920
What's the matter?

402
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
It's beenrea got throttled.

403
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,560
Help me have it.

404
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,560
let me put it in the fridge

405
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Put it in the fridge.

406
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Leave the vegetables.

407
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
Don't you want to eat it?

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
If you want to eat it, you can put it a little bit.

409
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay.

410
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
Do you want to put some water dumplings?

411
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,000
It's New Year's Day today.

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay.

413
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Then put it in.

414
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Give me two eggs.

415
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I put a whole bag of noodles.

416
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
So?

417
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
I may not be able to help you with too much.

418
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
What?

419
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm not particularly hungry.

420
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I know.

421
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
Noodles are

422
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,000
quite delicious.

423
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,800
You look like you're poisoned.

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,800
I didn't expect you to cook.

425
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,200
What else can I do?

426
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
Isn't that too much?

427
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
For example?

428
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
For example,

429
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,000
the noodles for the main actor.

430
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
I told you I'm not hungry. Why don't you eat?

431
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I'll eat later.

432
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
You're staring at me like that.

433
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
It's a little strange, right?

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Isn't it New Year's Day today?

435
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,200
The dinner should be noodles.

436
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,000
The noodles should be eaten together.

437
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,800
Do you have a name for your sister?

438
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Fu Gui is a long-time-standing and rich man.

439
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Noodles.

440
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,200
There are dumplings outside.

441
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
I'll eat the noodles for you.

442
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,600
I'll eat the noodles for you.

443
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,200
I'll eat the noodles for you.

444
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
I'll eat the noodles for you.

445
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll eat the dumplings for you.

446
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,000
It seems like the first time I eat alone and in the wild

447
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,600
after the accident.

448
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You're still young.

449
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Is the TV show good?

450
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,400
Who do you want to watch?

451
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
A-Qing.

452
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Mom, wish you a happy new year.

453
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,800
Have you eaten?

454
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Yes.

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm still eating dumplings.

456
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
A-Qing.

457
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,800
Say hello to A-Qing.

458
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Hello.

459
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I don't even know what you mean

460
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
in the past few years.

461
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm not sure.

462
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
I'm not sure.

463
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
I don't even know what you mean in the past few years.

464
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I've made a few more dishes in the past few years.

465
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
You can try them later.

466
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Eat more.

467
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
If it's not enough, I have more.

468
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I have more food left.

469
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Jiajia, eat more.

470
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Xiao Fan, eat more.

471
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
This is my house.

472
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm the garlic.

473
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,800
I don't want to eat here.

474
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
How did you promise me before?

475
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Can't you bear to bear it?

476
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Xiao Fan,

477
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
can you eat?

478
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Old Zhang.

479
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Say hello to A-Qing.

480
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Hello, Xiao Fan.

481
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Uncle.

482
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Say something more.

483
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Xiao Fan.

484
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Happy new year.

485
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I'll come to your house to do it.

486
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

487
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Bye.

488
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Jiajia,

489
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
are you going to work today?

490
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
You must be tired.

491
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Go to bed early.

492
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I'll hang up now.

493
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Bye.

494
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Why didn't you tell them

495
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
what your parents have been paying your dad Pour Your Mi?

496
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
That has to be true.

497
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,080
A younger brother

498
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,800
who came for his protest of power's need

499
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
for a few years.

500
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Who?

501
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Brother Lin.

502
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Brother Linaggi.

503
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
I've been like this all my life.

504
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
My parents don't like me.

505
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm not going to sleep.

506
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Okay.

507
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Did you sing in the front row?

508
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm going to sing in the river.

509
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Can we sing together?

510
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Okay.

511
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,800
You sing first.

512
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Okay.

513
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm not going to sing.

514
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm not going to sing.

515
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Tianan.

516
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
Go to sleep.

517
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm going to sleep.

518
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm going to sleep.

519
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Happy New Year.

520
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Happy New Year.

521
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
You sing, he's not a son.

522
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
You sing.

523
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm going to sleep.

524
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I'm going to sleep.

525
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Jiang.

526
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Jiang.

527
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
Jiang.

528
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Don't be sad.

529
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
You're going to...

530
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
How can I keep my word?

531
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Can you let him stay with you?

532
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,800
I'm going to my mom's.

533
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
After all, it's my grandma.

534
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
You know what?

535
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
You're still here.

536
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
I'm going to my mom's.

537
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I'm going to my mom's.

538
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
I'm going to my mom's.

539
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm going to my mom's.

540
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
I'm going to my mom's.

541
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm going to my mom's.

542
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
You're still young.

543
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
You're not good at taking care of your child.

544
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Think about it.

545
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Right?

546
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm back.

547
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Yifan.

548
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,800
When mom's done with her work,

549
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll pick you up.

550
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I'm leaving.

551
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Zhouqiao,

552
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
you can't take care of your grandma.

553
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
You can stay with her.

554
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
You can't do that.

555
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Jiang.

556
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
It's time to eat.

557
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
If you don't want to stay with me,

558
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
you just call your mom.

559
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
He can pick you up.

560
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Mom!

561
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
Mom!

562
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,560
Are there any scars in it?

563
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,800
Hello,發現er.

564
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,520
20.

565
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,920
20.

566
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,040
Uncle asked me to buy something for 20 yuan.

567
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Are you sure you want to buy it?

568
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,480
You're still standing behind it.

569
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,200
I lost my money.

571
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,560
How could you lose it?

572
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,560
Did I have to be sent to another place?

573
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,480
Don't be so sudden.

574
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,880
So warm.

575
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,480
Didn't even sit on this toilet.

576
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,960
Why is this one not working?

577
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
You owe me 20 yuan.

578
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,120
I didn't bring money

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,360
for the ball.

580
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,280
Then I don't need it.

581
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,000
What do you mean?

582
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,560
I don't have money now.

583
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,200
I don't mean I can't give you money in five minutes.

584
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,600
Take it.

585
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,240
Take it.

586
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,960
Wait here for me.

587
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,800
Five minutes.

588
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,680
Five minutes.

589
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Just wait here.

590
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,360
Here.

591
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,400
Take it.

592
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
You can give me any change.

593
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,880
Thank you.

594
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,720
What are you doing?

595
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,240
You look like you're crying.

596
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,120
You're not that emotional.

597
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,880
Fine.

598
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,960
It's not a big deal.

599
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,920
You're just wasting 20 yuan.

600
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,760
If you lose money again,

601
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
what will you do?

602
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,920
I can see you

603
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,600
no matter how many times I think about it.

604
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,680
Honey.

605
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Honey.

606
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,120
Honey.

607
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,240
Honey.

608
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,640
These two guys can't be friends at all.

609
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,180
What are you guys so sure about?

610
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,880
You must marry Angel Zhao.

611
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,100
Here we go.

612
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,340
Happy New Year!

613
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Happy New Year!

614
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,340
I'm so excited!

615
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Long time no see.

616
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Look, we've been here for half a year.

617
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Are you surprised?

618
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,100
Yes, I am.

619
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,740
Come in.

620
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
Okay.

621
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,340
This is the new home for the New Year.

622
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
Okay.

623
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
This is the business room.

624
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,340
Qiao Qiao, this is the other room.

625
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,340
Don't come in.

626
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,340
You're so nervous.

627
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
We've made a reservation.

628
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,340
Someone is here to greet you.

629
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,340
We're outsiders.

630
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
Look, I bought you a new one.

631
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
Qiao Qiao said we love to eat this.

632
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,340
She saw this in the shop downstairs.

633
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,340
I said she wanted to eat it.

634
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,340
No way!

635
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,340
I'm a big fan of New Year.

636
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,340
Let's share it.

637
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,340
We're so familiar now.

638
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I'll get it for you.

639
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Lin Tian, I need a bathroom.

640
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,340
This is the bathroom.

641
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,340
Go to my room.

642
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,340
I have a bathroom.

643
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,340
Men won't mind.

644
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
He will.

645
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
Here, this one.

646
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
You can put a card on it.

647
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
I'll play with it.

648
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
I'll get it for you.

649
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
I'll answer the phone first.

650
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,340
Where is it?

651
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,340
In the drawer I drew.

652
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,340
Hello?

653
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
Are you okay?

654
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
What's the matter?

655
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
I bought a lot this morning.

656
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
I'm on the phone.

657
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Help me eat.

658
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
I didn't expect you to pick up the phone.

659
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
Hurry up.

660
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
I'm in a hurry.

661
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Bian Tian.

662
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,340
I can't find the phone.

663
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,340
You can find it.

664
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
I'll get it for you later.

665
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
You have a side card?

666
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Yes.

667
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Qiao Qiao said she'll give it to me.

668
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
I just wanted to call you.

669
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
You called me.

670
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
I'm so sad.

671
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
The next person is here.

672
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Eat this.

673
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Hello? Are you listening?

674
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,340
I'm too noisy here.

675
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
I can't hear you.

676
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,340
I'll be back later.

677
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Hello?

678
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Are you hurt?

679
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,340
I'm sick.

680
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
I'm sick.

681
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
What should we do?

682
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
She's back again.

683
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Didn't we say

684
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
we can open a movie set at home?

685
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
It's so cold.

686
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,340
Where are we going?

687
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Bian Tian.

688
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,340
Shouldn't we go out

689
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,340
after the festival?

690
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,340
I haven't been back for a long time.

691
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Let's go shopping.

692
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Let's go to a different place.

693
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
Sure.

694
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,340
But I can't go home too late.

695
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
Bian Tian.

696
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Something's wrong with you.

697
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Are you afraid of Sang Yan?

698
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,340
What's the relationship with Sang Yan?

699
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
He has a reason

700
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
to stay with Sang Yan.

701
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
He can't take his friends home.

702
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,340
He can't go home too late.

703
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
It's not that exaggerated.

704
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,340
Sang Yan is usually shy of you.

705
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I'm afraid of him.

706
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
No.

707
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
Don't listen to him.

708
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm afraid of him.

709
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
If you're not afraid,

710
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,340
it's a disaster.

711
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
It's fun to play like this.

712
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
We play P.K. in the game.

713
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
We're against each other.

714
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
We're against each other.

715
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,340
We're against each other.

716
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
We're against each other.

717
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
If you want to escape,

718
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
you can sit down.

719
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
Let's escape.

720
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Let's escape.

721
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
Okay.

722
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
You've been talking about

723
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
the scenery of the festival for so long.

724
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
Is this it?

725
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
I've been here before.

726
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,340
It's really beautiful.

727
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
It's too cold.

728
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,340
My head hurts.

729
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
I think it's pretty.

730
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Do you know?

731
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
There's a fairy here.

732
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,340
If you're in the hospital now,

733
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,340
she can help you.

734
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
Where?

735
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
There.

736
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
The beautiful house.

737
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,340
The beautiful house?

738
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,340
The beautiful house.

739
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
I'll answer the phone.

740
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,340
What's wrong with Sister Chun?

741
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
She's here.

742
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
We don't need to see each other.

743
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,340
You should turn it off.

744
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,340
It's been a year ago.

745
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
I'll pick it up.

746
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,340
Dingding.

747
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,340
What's wrong with you?

748
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
I'm sorry.

749
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,340
Why can't I find the time?

750
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Hello.

751
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
Hello.

752
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,340
Zhang Xiaoqiao.

753
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
I'm thinking

754
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
if we should practice.

755
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
We still need to practice?

756
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
You should discuss it.

757
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
I'm just helping you eat.

758
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
Please.

759
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
Where?

760
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
At work.

761
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Okay.

762
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I got it.

763
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Okay.

764
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
I'll make a decision.

765
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
I really don't need it.

766
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
It's okay.

767
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Here.

768
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
Let's go.

769
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
Are you waiting for a dream?

770
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,340
It seems to be a dream.

771
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
You're afraid of the dream.

772
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,340
You don't believe it.

773
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Here.

774
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Take the medicine.

775
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Thank you.

776
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,340
Go back and drink.

777
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Okay.

778
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,340
I'm just here to work.

779
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,340
Yes.

780
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
The client is coming to talk with us.

781
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Remember to take the medicine.

782
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,340
Okay.

783
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
Take care.

784
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
Bye.

785
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Hello, Xiaoqiao.

786
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
You're not home so soon, right?

787
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,340
I just arrived.

788
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,340
I'm still in the taxi.

789
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Where did you guys go?

790
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Well...

791
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
What do you want to say?

792
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Can I help you?

793
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
No.

794
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I'm just here to talk to you.

795
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Okay.

796
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I'm just here to talk to you.

797
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,340
Okay.

798
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,340
I'm just here to talk to you.

799
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Okay.

800
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm just here to talk to you.

801
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
Okay.

802
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,340
I'm just here to talk to you.

803
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,340
Okay.

804
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,340
Can I help you?

805
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Can I help you?

806
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,340
Can I help you?

807
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,340
He doesn't seem to be here.

808
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
What's wrong?

809
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,340
Are you afraid that you might meet him at home?

810
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,340
Of course not.

811
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,340
Okay, let's do this first.

812
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Do you want to take me with you?

813
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
Let's go eat something.

814
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Okay, Uncle Lin.

815
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,340
Xiaoqiao,

816
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
let's go eat something delicious.

817
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,340
You can go to work.

818
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Okay.

819
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
You guys can go now.

820
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
Bye.

821
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
Okay, bye.

822
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,340
Go and get some food.

823
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
It's been a long day.

824
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
I'm feeling sick.

825
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,340
Okay.

826
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Is there anything?

827
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,340
I bought a lot this morning.

828
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
I'll eat some in the shop.

829
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
I'm hungry.

830
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
I'm hungry.

831
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
If you don't want to eat,

832
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
you can go to the shop.

833
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
No.

834
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
Let's eat first.

835
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
Take care of yourself.

836
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Dingding.

837
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Dingding.

838
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Dingding.

839
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
Dingding.

840
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Dingding.

841
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,340
Dingding.

842
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
Dingding.

843
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Dingding.

844
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
Dingding.

845
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
What are you looking for?

846
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,340
You're back.

847
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,340
What?

848
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,340
You're back in the afternoon.

849
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
I'm sorry.

850
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,340
I forgot to drink the porridge you said today.

851
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
What's the apology?

852
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
You don't know

853
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I bought this porridge for you.

854
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,340
Who said that

855
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I can't bring a stranger

856
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,340
to your house

857
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
when I'm done with my work?

858
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Who?

859
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
I'm sorry.

860
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
I'll tell you in advance.

861
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
I'll tell you in advance.

862
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,340
I'll go ahead.

863
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Do you mean to punish me?

864
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Fine.

865
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,340
What do you mean?

866
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
I don't know either.

867
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,340
You can say it.

868
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,340
If I say it,

869
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
then...

870
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,340
I'll exchange it.

871
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
What do you want to exchange?

872
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
Tomorrow.

873
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'll bring someone

874
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
to eat at home tomorrow.

875
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Do you have a girlfriend?

876
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
I mean

877
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
if you have a girlfriend,

878
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,340
you should tell her in advance

879
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
that I'm not going to

880
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
make her misunderstand.

881
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I don't have a girlfriend.

882
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,340
But

883
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
you don't have to be happy.

884
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I don't want to talk to you.

885
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Fine.

886
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Then during our meeting,

887
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
if you talk to her,

888
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
we'll communicate.

889
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
Of course.

890
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
If I talk to her,

891
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,340
I'll tell you in advance.

892
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,340
I don't believe it.

893
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Who is she going to talk to?

894
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
We are talking about

895
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
the girl in our room.

896
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I don't know.

897
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
I don't know.

898
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
We can talk about

899
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
the girl in our room.

900
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I don't know.

901
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I don't know.

902
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
You don't know?

903
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I don't know.

904
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
I don't know.

905
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,340
Then

906
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
I'll tell you in advance

907
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
that I'm not going to

908
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
make her misunderstand.

909
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I don't know.

910
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
I don't know.

911
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
I don't know.

912
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,340
I don't know either.

913
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I don't know either.

914
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,220
Now

915
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,540
you eat it

916
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,100
Your brother

917
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,020
Let me mention one

918
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,020
Okay

919
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,140
Next

920
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,020
I got a hangover

921
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,900
What is he going to celebrate?

922
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,940
Mirror TV

923
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,300
Friends what?

924
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,220
It's time for the ghost club

925
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,980
Oh

926
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,460
Even the witness says

927
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,420
Today is New Year's Day

928
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,080
I'm totally retired

929
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,520
No problem

930
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,340
Cash

931
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,540
no problem

932
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,380
it's einy一y

933
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,340
I have not a chance

934
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Why are you back?

935
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,340
I thought you wouldn't come back before you leave.

936
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,340
There are too many relatives in the house.

937
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,340
I can't leave.

938
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,340
I'm waiting for you at the age of three.

939
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,340
The sun is shining, the warmth is warm and cold.

940
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,340
It gives me a sense of luxury.

941
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,340
You are the wind in the wind.

942
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,340
It doesn't want me to come.

943
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,340
You are standing by me.

944
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,340
You are the rainbow beside me.

945
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

946
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,340
The rain is full of the ground.

947
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,340
But I have you.

948
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:39,340
I can show the darkness before my eyes.

949
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,340
All the thoughts and memories are you.

950
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,340
We are youth, every step is a miracle.

951
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:53,340
Every moment is a journey.

952
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

953
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
Every moment is a big news.

954
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,340
I want to tell you.

955
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,340
We will go through this journey together.

956
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,340
I won't give up.

957
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:11,340
I will be here with you.

958
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,340
I'm waiting for you at the age of three.

959
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,340
The sun is shining, the warmth is warm and cold.

960
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,340
It gives me a sense of luxury.

961
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,340
You are the wind in the wind.

962
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,340
It doesn't want me to come.

963
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,340
You are standing by me.

964
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,340
You are the rainbow beside me.

965
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

966
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,340
The rain is full of the ground.

967
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,340
But I have you.

968
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

969
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
I won't give up.

970
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,340
You are the rainbow beside me.

971
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,340
You are the rainbow beside me.

972
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,340
You are the rainbow beside me.

973
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

974
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,340
I won't give up.

975
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,340
I will be here with you.

976
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

977
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,340
The rain is full of the ground.

978
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,340
But I have you.

979
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,340
I can't stop looking at the road.

980
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,340
I won't give up.

981
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,340
You are the wind in the wind.

982
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,340
It doesn't want me to come.
