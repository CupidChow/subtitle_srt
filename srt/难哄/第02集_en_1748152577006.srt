1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,800
The world is full of people, you are the one who is alone

2
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,400
The rain of fate makes us meet

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe it's because of you, I'm so worried about you

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm so worried that I can't be with you

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,400
I've decided to become a man for you, for you to be brave

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I've always understood, I've always changed my memory

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
All the storms and storms are because of the storm

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
It's because of you, I'm so worried about you

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
The world is watching me, I'm left and right, what's the point?

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
Even if there's someone at the end, I will be there

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not good at being full of people, I'm afraid of you

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not good at being full of people, I'm afraid of you

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,200
I've always loved you

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:57,000
English translation by Main persons

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Bye-bye.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
17 class.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
17 class.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Really?

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Drink some water.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Senior,

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
what's the situation with 17 class?

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sorry, I'm new.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Turn left to the stairs.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
New building.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then?

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Then you see the number on the door.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's a student on the balcony.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll give you one by one.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Student?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you, student.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sorry.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sir.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sang Yan?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm Wen Yifan.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Wen Yifan?

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You and Sang Yan didn't come on this list.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sorry.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think Sang Yan is more like a girl.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thought it was you.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sir.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sorry, sir.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm late.

47
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,240
It's him.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
You're late for the first day of your college.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,520
You two came together?

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
No, we didn't.

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
I didn't find the entrance.

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
I found it for a while.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
What's your reason?

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
My dad doesn't know I'm in high school.

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
He sent me to the middle school.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,120
Are you coming in?

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
It's been three years.

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll let you in first.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
I'll go to the middle school.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,320
I have to walk.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
I'll walk.

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,520
Anyway, I'm leaving as soon as possible.

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Don't avoid me.

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,180
Take care.

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,720
Thank you.

66
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
The last one was shared by these two.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,240
Go.

68
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
One..

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
is Wen Yifan.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
At that moment,

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,280
it seems that this world

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
has more than one me in the world.

73
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
The End

74
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Yantian.

75
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,440
Xiao Qiao, it's late.

76
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,040
Yes.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,440
Let's go.

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
We'll go to the party later.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,440
It's not late for such a night.

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,440
It's been a long time

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
since we've been so lively tonight.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,200
It can't end like this.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Let's go.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,000
But I have to go back to clean up the material.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,680
Don't lose it.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Then I'll wait for you to finish the material.

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,880
I heard that there is a annual activity

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,360
at home tonight.

89
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm too tired to work overtime.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm still working overtime.

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
I can't go.

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
No, you have to accompany me.

93
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Okay.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
You accompany me.

95
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,920
Go, go.

97
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Go by yourself.

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,080
I can wait for you.

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
I can wait for you.

100
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,320
Go, go.

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't wait for me.

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,320
Go.

103
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,040
Be safe.

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,120
I know.

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,320
Why don't you go with your friends?

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,720
You come.

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Go.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,720
Sister.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
Today's work is over.

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
Everyone did a good job.

111
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,400
I think you should

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,720
relax yourself.

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Yifan.

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,920
I always think you're very depressed.

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,520
I think you should learn to open yourself.

116
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Forget about some bad emotions and unhappy things.

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,520
Use a new face to face the new year.

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,320
Happy New Year.

119
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Happy New Year.

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Happy New Year.

121
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Happy New Year.

122
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
It's good and bad.

123
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,320
Let's make a wish for ourselves.

124
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Happy New Year.

125
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Happy New Year.

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
What's wrong?

127
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,320
Are you okay?

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,920
Are you okay?

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Are you okay?

130
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Are you okay?

131
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm fine.

132
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm fine.

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm fine.

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm fine.

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm not Wen Yifan.

136
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
I'm Zhong Siqiao.

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,920
You're wrong.

138
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,920
Yes, yes.

139
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I said you're Wen Yifan's friend.

140
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
You're not Yifan's.

141
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Zhong Siqiao.

142
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Yes, yes, yes.

143
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,520
Yes.

144
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,520
Good.

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,400
Double.

146
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
Here.

147
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Double.

148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,020
Hello.

149
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,520
Who's that?

150
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
For another soulmate.

151
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
You should remember her.

152
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
flock with me on high school.

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,900
Fear

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:26,600
the

155
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,920
DaÃ±ing, do you know who is the 100th  grass neighborhood head?

156
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Sang Yan

157
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't you recognize the woodland

158
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
nor the woodland?

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm not afraid of you.

160
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm afraid of you.

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm afraid of you.

162
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm afraid of you.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm afraid of you.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm afraid of you.

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm afraid of you.

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm afraid of you.

167
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm afraid of you.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm afraid of you.

169
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm afraid of you.

170
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm afraid of you.

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I'm afraid of you.

172
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I'm afraid of you.

173
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm afraid of you.

174
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm afraid of you.

175
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Or else I'm afraid of you.

176
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,840
My dear sister,

177
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,760
you're forever.

178
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm always against you.

179
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
My dear sister,

180
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
don't be afraid of me.

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I only miss you

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Come in. This is the room I live in

183
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Su Qian said you were looking for a house

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Now the house is not good

185
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
It's not good during the New Year

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Especially the house that is so close to my company

187
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
It's not good

188
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Thank you

189
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Actually I'm good at the distance

190
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
I want to ask the rent

191
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Why can't you care about the distance

192
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
For our company

193
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Every day and night

194
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,600
The time is money

195
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
It's not early to have more water

196
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
This room is yours

197
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
My friend moved in last class

198
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
For a while

199
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I moved to another room with a rich boyfriend

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
This is the living room

201
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Now the risk of living with strangers is too high

202
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
The weird number and the weird probability are very high

203
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
So I have to be free

204
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Don't make a stranger

205
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
So he invited me to his house

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
You decide first

207
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
After all, it's not a small thing to move

208
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Then your house is empty

209
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I'll answer the phone

210
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Drink water

211
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Hello

212
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
I just want to ask

213
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Did you get the picture of the New Year

214
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,600
It's just a picture of us running a hot spring together

215
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Don't show it to others

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
What are you laughing at

217
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm not running a hot spring

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm hanging up

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
How about it

220
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Xiaojian 3000

221
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
I only make 7000

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Water bill

223
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
We can have a drink

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
If you are 24 hours a day

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Start the air conditioner

226
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Take a shower and take a shower

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
And have a meal every day

228
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Then you can't have a drink

229
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I want to

230
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I want to

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Welcome to the city of Du Hua

232
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
What's the need

233
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Just tell me in time

234
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Although the rent is much higher than the city hospital

235
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
As long as there is a place to sleep

236
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
That's good

237
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Sister Ming

238
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You broke up with Qin An again

239
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
And eat together

240
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,600
He has been begging me to give him another chance

241
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Although I know we can't

242
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I can still eat without rice

243
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
He specially ordered a high-end restaurant

244
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Don't be embarrassed to move the chopsticks

245
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Lianling

246
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Hi

247
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Get in the car

248
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I didn't eat

249
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I've been here for half an hour

250
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
I didn't expect to buy a flower for you

251
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Wei Fan

252
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Wei Fan, it's you

253
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
I didn't admit my mistake this time

254
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Su Huaan?

255
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Yes, it's me

256
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
I met Zhong Siqiao at work yesterday

257
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
And I met you

258
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Get in the car

259
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
How about I really don't go?

260
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Why?

261
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
It's okay

262
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
We can be friends

263
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Take care

264
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Okay

265
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Be careful

266
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Sit down

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
There's someone else

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Look at your half moon

269
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Wei Fan

270
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
You know each other?

271
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
We're the same age

272
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Half moon

273
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
What do you mean?

274
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Did Sang Yan know Xiao Fan before?

275
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
But he didn't know

276
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Yes

277
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Why don't I remember?

278
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Did you remember it wrong?

279
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
How could I?

280
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
You two are...

281
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
You two are awkward

282
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
You've been together for years

283
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I'll be your teacher

284
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I'll be your teacher

285
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't know how long you've been together

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Wei Fan

287
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
You're still a high school student

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
High school student

289
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
You're a high school student

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
You're a high school student

291
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
You're a high school student

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Sang Yan

293
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Why do you say that?

294
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
You're still asking me this

295
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
You're still asking me this

296
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
He thinks that

297
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Wei Fan can't see her

298
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Who knows?

299
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
He's just a mother

300
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Okay, drive carefully

301
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
It's too late

302
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Why are you so slow?

303
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
You have to pick up Mr. Qian

304
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm in the car

305
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
You're here

306
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Who's that girl?

307
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Sang Yan, you're not late

308
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You can't tell me if you're late

309
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Don't talk nonsense

310
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
This is our old classmate

311
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
He's a famous school boy

312
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Sang Yan is not worthy of him

313
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Wei Fan

314
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Let me introduce you to

315
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Qian Fei, Chen Junwen, Sang Yan

316
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
They're from the same class

317
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Hello

318
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm the best of them

319
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
We four are working overtime

320
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Hello

321
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
What's the matter?

322
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
I'm hungry

323
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
Hurry up

324
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Thank you

325
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Come on

326
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Make some food first

327
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Let's celebrate today

328
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Okay

329
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm not free

330
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm working overtime

331
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm working overtime

332
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm a workaholic

333
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I don't believe you'll ask Xiaofan

334
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
You want to know if you got the picture of the year

335
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You got it

336
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
It's the picture of us running a hot spring together

337
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
It's okay

338
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It's good to have you

339
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Here

340
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
This is for you

341
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Thank you

342
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Just today's date

343
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Let's celebrate for Sang Yan together

344
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
January 2nd, the festival

345
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm going to break the house

346
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
You gave me a birthday

347
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
And agreed to it

348
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Bro

349
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
It's a surprise

350
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
You're not in a mood

351
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Bro

352
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
You said it so early

353
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
You're still so calm

354
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
You're still so calm

355
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
You're hiding in the house

356
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm so happy

357
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Sorry, I'm coming

358
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Come on

359
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Hurry up

360
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Xiaofan

361
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
You refused Sang Yan before

362
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
I really don't understand you

363
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
You said he's so good

364
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
He's tall and handsome

365
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I

366
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
I think he's so cold today

367
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
I don't mean it to you

368
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's all over

369
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,600
You have to learn to hold a chance

370
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
You have to know

371
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Sometimes you find a good partner

372
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
It's more useful than promotion

373
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
What's your number?

374
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
It's pretty

375
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm not a girl today

376
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm a girl

377
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I'm a girl

378
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Just help me

379
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I'm really a girl

380
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
I haven't seen you for a long time

381
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Long time no see

382
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Long time no see

383
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I've only been here for two days

384
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
It's been a long time

385
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
I haven't seen you for a long time

386
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
You're the one who pretend to not know

387
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
I thought you didn't recognize me

388
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
After all, I wore a mask that day

389
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I really don't know you

390
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I didn't expect you to be so good

391
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm good too

392
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Luo Qianya, you misunderstood

393
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I didn't see you

394
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
My sister saw you

395
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
She told me

396
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
You keep staring at me

397
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
It's true

398
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Because I saw you

399
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
There was no crying

400
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I saw you

401
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
There was no crying

402
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I was talking about this

403
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
with many people around me

404
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
But you don't have to care too much

405
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Because it's been

406
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
a few hours

407
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
I'll go first

408
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
What's wrong?

409
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm hungry

410
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I'll eat the new one

411
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
That one, Zhang Ge

412
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You can eat it later

413
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I can eat it later

414
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
It's okay

415
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
I'll give you some fresh food

416
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Come on

417
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Let's eat

418
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
How about you being a singer?

419
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I have a few friends

420
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
I recommend you

421
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I'm sorry

422
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I'll go back first

423
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Because the leader suddenly said

424
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I was going to change the film

425
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
You didn't even run away

426
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Did you eat the food?

427
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Is it delicious?

428
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I'll tell him

429
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
No need, I just transferred

430
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Thank you

431
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Then be careful on the way

432
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Bye, girl

433
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
What's going on?

434
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
What's going on?

435
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Drink one

436
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Drink one

437
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I want to go home

438
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I'm going to get some water

439
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
OK

440
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Let's go

441
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
OK

442
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll go

443
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Bye

444
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
You still remember

445
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Su Haohan's car

446
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
came to the morning?

447
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
No, I don't

448
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Don't you remember?

449
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Which area?

450
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
It should be A.G

451
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
A.G. Transfer

452
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
A.G

453
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
A.G

454
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
A.G

455
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
A.G

456
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
A.G

457
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
A.G

458
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
A.G

459
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
A.G

460
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
A.G

461
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
A.G

462
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I found it

463
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
A.G

464
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
A.G

465
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Well

466
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Can you follow me?

467
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
It's very difficult to reach the city now

468
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Where?

469
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
The city hospital

470
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm leaving.

471
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I'm leaving.

472
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Then I won't bother you anymore.

473
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Miss Bai.

474
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I want to hear from you.

475
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Please you go on the taxi,

476
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Wen yÃ¼zden.

477
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,800
Time i'm alone

478
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,320
Sorry.

479
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,560
Sorry.

480
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
Thanks.

481
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Um...

482
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,600
Bye...

483
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,960
Again.

484
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,680
How much is this music?

485
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I won't keep telling them.

486
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
It's a long story.

487
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Have you been with them for a long time?

488
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
No.

489
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
It's your birthday today.

490
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Don't forget.

491
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Good bye.

492
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Do you like it?

493
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Did you give it to me?

494
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Why did you give it to me?

495
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
It's a birthday.

496
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
You're not a birthday girl.

497
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
You still remember?

498
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm glad to remember.

499
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Thank you.

500
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Then...

501
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I won't remember your birthday from now on.

502
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
It's okay.

503
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I won't celebrate it.

504
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
January 2nd, the ending is...

505
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
I won't celebrate it.

506
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
I think it's over.

507
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
But it's okay.

508
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
There's a subway entrance ahead.

509
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Help me put the line there.

510
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm a driver.

511
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Then let's go now.

512
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
You go first.

513
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Or Han Zhou will choose.

514
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Then...

515
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

516
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Thank you so much.

517
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I want to see you again soon.

518
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I think I've got a problem with my work.

519
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Which one?

520
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
That's a pity.

521
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I don't want to see you again.

522
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
I don't want to see you again.

523
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
I'll go back now.

524
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I'll go back now.

525
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
rubbish

526
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Come station

527
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
21

528
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,060
Amp

529
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Stevens

530
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,200
Yam

531
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Who is it?

532
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,880
Oh, sister Mei. You're back.

533
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,160
Give me my bag.

534
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,920
I finally see you.

535
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,120
You're the one who made our brothers wait for a few days.

536
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,480
You just don't understand the reason why you're wearing shoes, right?

537
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,800
Give me my bag.

538
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,480
Give it to me.

539
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,160
I don't understand him.

540
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,720
But I'm a little...

541
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,760
Brother Xiao!

542
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,160
Brother Xiao!

543
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,560
Brother Xiao!

544
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,000
Brother Xiao!

545
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
Brother Xiao!

546
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,400
What's going on?

547
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,680
Get back!

548
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,080
Don't run!

549
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,760
Don't run!

550
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,520
Brother Xiao!

551
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,040
Stop!

552
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Are you okay?

553
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,560
Stop!

554
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,080
Brother Xiao!

555
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,200
Chase him!

556
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,760
Go!

557
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,040
Go!

558
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,680
You can run quite well.

559
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,960
What are you running on?

560
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
Go!

561
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,400
Go!

562
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,880
Who's there?

563
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,720
Go!

564
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,240
Let me go.

565
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,640
Go!

566
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,080
Don't run!

567
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,880
Go!

568
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Brother Xiao!

569
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,240
I'm going.

570
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,640
Relatives.

571
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,400
Ms kro sl planning.

572
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
You can hurry and come up.

573
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,360
Hurry!

574
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,840
Little times.

575
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,880
Be careful!

576
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,520

Open the door!

579
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Teng Xi, De Yang!

580
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Teng Shu!

581
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Hello, do you want to go?

582
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Go!

583
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
Open the door!

584
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Be careful! Is there a yellow one?

585
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Open the door!

586
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Go!

587
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
Do you want to go to the hospital?

588
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Do you have any other place to go to the hospital?

589
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
Mei Fan.

590
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm standing here, don't you see me?

591
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,600
What's wrong?

592
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Why don't you call me to help you?

593
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Where have you been?

594
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
What took you so long?

595
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
I was waiting for you to come back to cut cake.

596
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Okay, I'll be right back.

597
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Come on.

598
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Stop.

599
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Wen Yifan.

600
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Come here.

601
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Don't run.

602
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
I shouted so loudly that you couldn't hear me.

603
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
You couldn't see me.

604
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
You couldn't see me.

605
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
You were running away from me, right?

606
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Actually, I wanted to find you a way to help.

607
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,480
But I don't know if they will do it.

608
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I don't want to drag you down the water.

609
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
And...

610
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,480
And they have three people.

611
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
I'm afraid you can't beat them.

612
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Can I stop in front of you?

613
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Wait for me.

614
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Welcome.

615
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
Welcome.

616
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
What?

617
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Take some medicine.

618
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
No.

619
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
If you don't take the medicine,

620
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,480
I'm afraid you'll die if you get a broken wound.

621
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I don't want to be killed by a human.

622
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
Do you want me to help you?

623
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Does it hurt?

624
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Yes.

625
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Fifty six.

626
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Cover your upper nostril for a second.

627
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
Do you want to be so close to her?

628
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Sorry.

629
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,320
It's too dark.

630
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,960
I'm afraid I can't see it clearly.

631
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay.

632
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,160
Turn around.

633
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,520
It's horrible.

634
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,480
What do you mean?

635
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,680
So scary.

636
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
Look at me.

637
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,720
Look at me if you want to.

638
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,800
Let's look at me like this.

639
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,040
JustStar room, looking out the window to me

640
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,600
Not me.

641
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,160
I'll do it myself.

642
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,560
I just don't want to regret it.

643
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,480
Because I never told you

644
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,760
that I love you.

645
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,760
How can I say that I love you?

646
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,760
I always like to use my eyes to listen to you.

647
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,640
I thought about it many times. You said you were willing to.

648
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,920
Where's the ring?

649
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,200
I'm going to my friend's house tonight.

650
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,000
But I found a new house.

651
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,920
I haven't come to the office yet.

652
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
Goodbye.

653
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,120
It's not me.

654
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,080
I know it's not me.

655
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,480
I just don't want to regret it.

656
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,440
Because I never told you

657
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,720
that I love you.

658
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,720
How can I say that I love you?

659
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,680
I always like to use my eyes to listen to you.

660
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,760
I thought about it many times. You said you were willing to.

661
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,800
I said I love you.

662
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,760
I forgot to say that I love you.

663
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,840
I always look forward to the day I get to know you.

664
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:06,560
I'm not here without you.

665
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,560
I just want to...

666
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm home.

667
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,280
Goodbye.

668
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,080
Say goodbye many times.

669
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
What else do you want?

670
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
Go in and pack your luggage.

671
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,080
You're still planning to come back?

672
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,600
You can sit down. I'll go pack my things.

673
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,080
No need.

674
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I'll go pack my things.

675
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
No need.

676
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I just got scared.

677
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
I'm asking you.

678
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
What happened?

679
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Why are you still thinking about it?

680
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
I thought that person was still in the police station.

681
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
So it's safe now.

682
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Just a little thing.

683
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
I'm alone.

684
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
So I don't read much.

685
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
That's all.

686
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
I'm not alone.

687
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
I don't read much.

688
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
That's all.

689
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
I'm almost there.

690
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Is your friend staying in the hospital?

691
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I'm not sure either.

692
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,080
It's been a long day.

693
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm going to the hospital.

694
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm going to the hospital.

695
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
You're not going to the hospital?

696
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
No.

697
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
I'm not going to the hospital.

698
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
I'm not going to the hospital.

699
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I'm going to the hospital.

700
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Is your friend staying here?

701
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm really in trouble today.

702
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,080
When did you see me invite you to dinner?

703
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
I didn't eat.

704
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Even if I don't know anyone today,

705
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
I'll do whatever I can.

706
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,080
You suggest that I come here

707
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
a year later.

708
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Is there still time to look at it?

709
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,080
Even if you're short-sighted,

710
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,080
you won't affect your handsome.

711
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Qingxu, help me put it here.

712
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,080
Actually, I can do it myself.

713
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,080
I'll go.

714
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,080
I'm really sorry.

715
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm sorry.

718
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I'm sorry.

719
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,080
I'm sorry.

720
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,080
Thank you.

723
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Leave it here.

724
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I'm a certain girl.

725
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
I can do it on my own.

726
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Bye.

727
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,680
Dad.

728
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,640
Hey, dad, mom, dad.

729
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,680
Did you understand me?

730
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,520
I am sorry.

731
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,320
I hoped you wouldn't forget me.

732
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,520
I never need any help.

733
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,460
Umm?

734
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,280
You really hurt yourself!

735
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,180
I think you need time.

736
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,560
Dad.

737
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,560
Congratulations on getting out of here.

738
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,780
You go to the table few times for a bath and then go to theæ° cistern in a fire bed.

739
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,840
I should have taken a photo of him.

740
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,280
If I didn't let him see me,

741
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,400
he would have seen the whole world.

742
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,360
That's it.

743
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
Drink up.

744
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,640
I'll tell you later.

745
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,760
The smile is just a mirror in your eyes.

746
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Look at me.

747
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Look at me.

748
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
Look at me.

749
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Look at me.

750
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,360
The most fragile time.

751
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,760
I'll put you through.

752
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,160
I'll put you through.

753
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,360
I'll put you through.

754
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,480
I'll put you through.

755
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
I'll put you through.

756
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,160
I'll put you through.

757
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,040
What's going on?

758
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,400
I just want to go.

759
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,720
I really want to go.

760
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,760
Are you crazy?

761
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,160
You're crazy.

762
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,080
Yes.

763
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,640
How did you get back here?

764
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,280
Did my Huahua survive?

765
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,520
I saw it.

766
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,520
I'm not crazy.

767
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,720
The heart that used to be hot will also start to doubt

768
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,280
The firmness that is chasing after it

769
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,040
You never stopped

770
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,520
My every effort has its meaning

771
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,520
With time and space

772
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,160
Wait together

773
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,720
Like the sun, the warmth and the warmth

774
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,520
Give me a good time

775
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,120
It's you in the wind

776
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,560
He doesn't want me to come

777
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,200
It's you who always stand by me

778
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
By my side

779
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,760
I can't stop looking at the road

780
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,320
The rain is full of the sky

781
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,720
But I have you in my mind

782
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,720
I can only stand in the dark

783
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,920
All the thoughts and all the memories are you

784
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,320
In our youth, every step is a miracle

785
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,040
Every moment is a journey

786
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,160
It's not a fixed journey

787
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,920
I'm afraid I'll be lost and want to tell you

788
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,600
We will follow the journey together

789
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,400
I won't give up

790
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,400
I will be here with you

791
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,000
It's you in the wind

792
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,440
He doesn't want me to come

793
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,920
It's you who always stand by me

794
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,040
By my side

795
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,560
I can't stop looking at the road

796
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,080
The rain is full of the sky

797
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,600
But I have you in my mind

798
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,080
I can only stand in the dark

799
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,600
I won't give up

800
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,160
It's you who always stand by me

801
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,680
In our youth, every step is a miracle

802
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,200
It's you who always stand by me

803
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,280
Every moment is a journey

804
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,680
It's not a fixed journey

805
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,360
I'm afraid I'll be lost and want to tell you

806
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,760
We will follow the journey together

807
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,920
I won't give up

808
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,680
It's you who always stand by me

809
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,880
I won't give up

810
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,480
It's you who always stand by me

811
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,480
I won't give up

812
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,480
It's you who always stand by me
