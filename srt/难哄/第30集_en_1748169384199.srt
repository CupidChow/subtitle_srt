00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I'll be able to forget you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've loved you before.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've loved you before.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've loved you before.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dad, you too.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, eat.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's this new method?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's nourishing.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you feeling unwell?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's nothing.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's good that you're eating.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hurry and eat. It's cold.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hello, dad.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yang Jian.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why did you come back so late this time?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I didn't even come back yesterday.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm so happy.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going home.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hurry and go home.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ah Jiang.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you buy the cake that Mom bought you?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I did.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I even ate your rice.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, then you go back to work.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hurry and come back.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bye-bye.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mom, Dad, Ah Jiang.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom, what's wrong?

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I miss you so much.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can't see you.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I miss you so much.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I miss you the most.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Dad.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I remember.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You said Ah Jiang was still in the hospital.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you for your interview.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you for your interview and we are happy.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We are afraid now.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't bully dad for others.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't dare To say.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We're not here because we're afraid of others.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We should take care of ourselves.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When the video editing is done,

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll send it to you.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Okay.

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,600
Leave a contact form for them.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,440
Okay.

67
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,280
Hello?

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
Wang Wanmei.

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,240
It's almost done.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
Are you having a fever today?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm done with the morning check.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,840
The doctor has sealed the cage for me.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
Doesn't that hurt more?

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Are you serious?

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
Is it the shift?

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,360
I'll pick you up.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,720
Wait for me.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Jing.

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Jing.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Jing.

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Can you come here?

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I have something to tell you.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Jing.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,120
I just had lunch with your uncle.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,920
He's going back to work.

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm fine.

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
Jiang, it's your birthday today.

88
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,480
Let's have a talk, okay?

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,200
I have a fever.

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,840
I won't take too much time from you.

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,320
Give me a chance.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Let me tell you that my birthday is coming up.

93
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Okay?

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Jiang.

95
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,520
I'll order a cake for you.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
What kind of taste do you want?

97
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
No need.

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,240
Please get two strawberries.

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Okay, wait a minute.

100
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
We...

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,640
What did you say in the office?

102
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,240
I never thought that Chuxingde would be like this.

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,120
I did it because you were happy.

104
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Jiang.

105
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
At that time,

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,320
he didn't do anything to you.

107
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,560
I should have gone to the hospital

108
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
to get the medicine.

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm really scared.

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
I beg you to save me.

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm so sorry.

112
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm really scared.

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm begging you.

114
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Jiang.

115
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Don't cry.

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,520
Listen to me.

117
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,880
I'll definitely find your uncle to talk to you.

118
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
Don't worry.

119
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I'll hang up.

120
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Don't cry.

121
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
It's been a long time.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Jiang.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Did you get the situation wrong?

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,040
You...

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,680
My brother is a good man.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,720
He wouldn't do such a thing.

127
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,040
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,960
I...

129
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,440
I...

130
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,560
At that time,

131
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,080
I was really too close to you.

132
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,680
I was so close to you

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
that I couldn't say anything.

134
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
I was so close to you.

135
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm sorry that I didn't forgive you.

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,680
I just want to see you for a year.

138
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,280
Is that okay?

139
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
I love you.

140
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,480
My love you love me like you do

141
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,920
About the kunne pod's situation,

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Hmm.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,880
estimation.

144
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
Please take the cake.

145
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
You put it there.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
Thank you.

147
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,960
OK.

148
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,920
Is it you?

149
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
You make me very sad.

150
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Why should I love my mom the most in this world?

151
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
You don't love me at all.

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
No.

153
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
No, it's because...

154
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
It's because you have a new family.

155
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
So you have to think about it more.

156
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I should have thought about it when you sent me to grandma's house.

157
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You have to care about me more in order to have another family.

158
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
When I begged you for help, you chose not to hear it.

159
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I don't even know where you are going.

160
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
I should have thought about it when you don't care about me.

161
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Drink it.

162
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
I just want to drink some sweet now.

163
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
How's your health?

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
It's good.

165
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm so busy at work.

166
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I'll get some rest.

167
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Jing, I just cooked some soup.

168
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
You should drink some.

169
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Yes, drink some.

170
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Xie Zuo Yi,

171
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
why don't you call him?

172
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
It's okay.

173
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Xiao Fan is not familiar with it.

174
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Don't take him.

175
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Jing, I want to discuss something with you.

176
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Let's not quarrel.

177
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Control your emotions.

178
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,920
You can't be angry with me now.

179
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Why?

180
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm pregnant.

181
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Well,

182
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
he called me just now.

183
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll go to him.

184
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
You should ask my dad.

185
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
I don't want you to remember your dad for the rest of your life.

186
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
You can care about him.

187
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
You can have a new child.

188
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
But not now.

189
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
You,

190
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
the father is outside.

191
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
You,

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
the father is outside.

193
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Someone is there.

194
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I've

195
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
quarreled with him a few times.

196
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
He told me he won't be eating again.

197
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,920
Maybe,

198
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
he wanted you to come and stay with me.

199
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
So, he told you to go home.

200
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Is this a history re-enactment?

201
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
What happened to me,

202
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
this time, it's also a time of your experience.

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,920
We are not the one who was chosen by the firm.

204
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,920
We are all the one who was thrown away and abandoned.

205
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Dad.

206
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
Actually, I've been thinking about it.

207
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
How to fix our relationship.

208
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
I've never been in a relationship with you.

209
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
I'm afraid that if something happens to you,

210
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I don't know what to do.

211
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Because I think I'm too much.

212
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
After all, those years,

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
you didn't ask me,

214
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I still lived like this.

215
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
I've never told you these things.

216
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I feel like I have a stone in my heart.

217
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
After today,

218
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,920
I will delete all the relationships with you.

219
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I hope that,

220
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,920
we can be your daughter.

221
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
That night,

222
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I was already taken to the heart.

223
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I'll kill you.

224
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
I hope that,

225
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
the rain falls down.

226
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
The sea is so vast and beautiful.

227
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,920
There are all your old talents.

228
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Time flies, the wind blows.

229
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I feel like I can see us.

230
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,920
Flying in the rain, the sea is so deep.

231
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,920
I want to say hi to the future.

232
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Hey,

233
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,920
the sea is so precious.

234
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,920
The rain falls, the rain falls.

235
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,920
The rain falls, the rain falls.

236
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,920
The rain falls, the rain falls.

237
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Chief Qin,

238
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
go back to the country.

239
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Do you want to say hello to me?

240
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,920
If,

241
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
the next summer,

242
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
it will be so long,

243
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
you can propose to me.

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
What?

245
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
Fine.

246
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Anything else?

247
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Anything else?

248
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Of course.

249
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Then,

250
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I hope that,

251
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
the next summer,

252
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
it will be so long.

253
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Your wish is the same as that of just now.

254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
You can help me to get a job.

255
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Your wish every year,

256
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
is what I want to do.

257
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Our wish in the past two years,

258
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
has been fulfilled.

259
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Are you talking about work,

260
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
or,

261
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
you want me to be your partner?

262
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Anything else?

263
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Do you want to give me three wishes?

264
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes.

265
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Then,

266
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I will ask you.

267
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Fine.

268
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Let's go.

269
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Come on.

270
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I love you.

271
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Then,

272
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
I will go back to the country.

273
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Anything else?

274
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
You,

275
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
smile.

276
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
What?

277
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Why are you always afraid that I will laugh at you?

278
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
You smile so cute.

279
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Don't use that word to describe me.

280
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Well,

281
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,920
well,

282
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
you smile so cute.

283
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Is that okay?

284
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Every time you smile,

285
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
you look so cute.

286
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
You look like you can dance.

287
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
You look like you can dance.

288
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Fine.

289
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I will be your partner.

290
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You smile so cute.

291
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,920
When did you become so professional?

292
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
You asked me to do it.

293
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Fine.

294
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Anything else?

295
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
What's wrong?

296
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Have you thought it over?

297
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I love you.

298
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
I love you.

299
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I love you.

300
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I love you.

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
From the past,

302
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
to now,

303
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
to the future,

304
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
to the future.

305
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I love you.

306
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I love you.

307
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I want to give you

308
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
my wish.

309
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I, Xu Yuan,

310
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
will have

311
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
someone else

312
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
other than me.

313
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I love you.

314
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I love you.

315
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
I'm so sad.

316
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
You didn't drive the car.

317
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
It took me six hours.

318
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm so sad.

319
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm so sad.

320
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Grandma, this one.

321
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
There are many trees here.

322
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Okay.

323
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Come here.

324
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Look.

325
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
This is

326
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
where they were in the car.

327
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
They said the car was too fast.

328
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
That's how they drove it.

329
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Think about it.

330
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,920
How could we take you to the primary school

331
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,920
and let you see this?

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Your grandpa and I

333
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
were about to faint.

334
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
We couldn't stand it.

335
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,920
I was the one who left you

336
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
at home.

337
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
I thought

338
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
you were the safest person

339
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
in the house.

340
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
But I didn't know

341
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
that this would affect you

342
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
for so many years.

343
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
I thought

344
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
it's good that

345
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
everyone is calm.

346
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
It's been a long time.

347
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
I started to think

348
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
if it was my fault

349
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
or if I was blaming myself.

350
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
It must be because I wasn't good enough

351
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
or I couldn't get your idea.

352
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
All the reasons are because

353
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
I deserve to die.

354
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I deserve to live, right?

355
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Why do you think so?

356
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
No one loves you.

357
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,920
You and your brother

358
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,920
have always been

359
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
my grandson and grandpa's favorite.

360
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Okay.

361
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Let's forget

362
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,920
the painful memories.

363
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Have you ever thought

364
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
of your name?

365
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Why is it called Hao An?

366
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Your father is Su Hao Yang.

367
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,920
Your mother is Hu Jia An.

368
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Your father has two words.

369
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
Your mother has three words.

370
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Then what is it?

371
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
Hao An.

372
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,920
You and your brother

373
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
are the meat

374
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
that your parents love.

375
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
They love you.

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
They love you

377
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
more than you do.

378
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
They love you more

379
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,920
than you do.

380
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
For so many years,

381
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
I've been trying to

382
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
get rid of everyone.

383
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I didn't expect

384
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
I was the one who was the most popular.

385
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I can't forgive the one who is the most popular.

386
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
We should treat ourselves better.

387
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Dad.

388
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Dad.

389
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Dad.

390
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Brother.

391
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
For so many years,

392
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I've grown up.

393
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
Have you ever seen it?

394
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
I was afraid of losing everything.

395
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
I always rely on others.

396
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,920
But now,

397
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I finally know

398
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
what it feels like to be loved.

399
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I'll always try to live

400
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,920
and live my life with confidence.

401
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
I'll also take good care of

402
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Grandpa and Grandma for you.

403
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Don't worry.

404
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Don't worry.

405
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
I'll take care of you

406
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
after Grandpa and Grandma are gone.

407
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Grandpa promised to go to the private holiday with me.

408
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Great, Grandma.

409
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Grandpa is finally willing to

410
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
fulfill his dream with you.

411
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
I'll leave now.

412
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Let's go.

413
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,920
Where are we going?

414
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
We'll go to the private holiday.

415
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
We're going home now.

416
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
We'll drive my car.

417
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
We can leave now.

418
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Aren't we going to call the old horse?

419
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Why do we have to call the old horse?

420
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
The old horse is driving.

421
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
No.

422
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Just the two of us.

423
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Just the two of us?

424
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Yes.

425
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
I'll call him and laugh.

426
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
What's wrong?

427
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Why did you call him and laugh?

428
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Of course.

429
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
I'll laugh with him.

430
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
I'm a private holiday.

431
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Who's laughing?

432
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
You're laughing.

433
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm playing with you.

434
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Okay?

435
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
Let's go.

436
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Let's go.

437
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Let's go.

438
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
That's great.

439
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Drive!

440
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
Drive!

441
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Drive!

442
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Where are you?

443
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Our show starts at 7 o'clock.

444
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
If I don't reply to you later,

445
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
you should be on the stage.

446
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Let Fushuang bring you in.

447
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Please.

448
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
What's this?

449
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Take a look.

450
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
What's wrong?

451
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
It's okay.

452
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Let's go.

453
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Yan.

454
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
I have an urgent matter to deal with.

455
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Senior, there are a few important projects.

456
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,920
You need to solve them.

457
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
You two can solve them.

458
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Yan.

459
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
You can solve them in ten minutes.

460
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
They've been singing for three days.

461
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
You can't say anything.

462
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
Yes.

463
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Yan, hurry up.

464
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Hurry up.

465
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Sister Zeyu.

466
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Xiaoyang,

467
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I want to ask you

468
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
about the third part of my show.

469
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
The third part?

470
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
It's so close.

471
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Are you ready?

472
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
No.

473
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm afraid my boyfriend won't be able to come.

474
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I said you were so low-key.

475
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
How could you agree to perform?

476
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
So...

477
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
So...

478
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
If he can't come later,

479
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
can you help me to make a video?

480
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
No problem.

481
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
I'll make you look pretty.

482
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Okay, get ready.

483
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Thank you.

484
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,920
You can do it.

485
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I just want to show you.

486
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Good.

487
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
The next one is your turn.

488
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Don't be nervous.

489
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Come on.

490
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Fu Zheng.

491
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Fu Zheng.

492
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
What's up?

493
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Fu Zheng.

494
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Fu Zheng.

495
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
Are you ready?

496
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
You should be.

497
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Why are you here?

498
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
I told you that Yifan is so good at cooking.

499
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
She has been working all day.

500
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
She went to the meeting room alone to rehearse.

501
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
You know how long she has been working.

502
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Why don't you come to accompany her?

503
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Alone?

504
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
She is singing with Su Tian.

505
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Singing?

506
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
No.

507
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's go.

508
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
The magic performance of the Golden Crab is coming.

509
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Did you see it?

510
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Next,

511
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I'll ask everyone to be quiet.

512
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Because next,

513
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,920
it's a performance show by the media channel.

514
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
8ne5,

515
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Hu Taojiazi,

516
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
the performer,

517
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
Wen Yifan.

518
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,920
Wen Yifan has been preparing for this performance for a long time.

519
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
I believe that everyone can enjoy a beautiful performance.

520
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
The performance of the Golden Crab is coming.

521
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Do you like dancing?

522
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Yifan.

523
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
When did you come?

524
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
When did your show start?

525
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
Have you finished?

526
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
No.

527
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Why don't you evaluate my performance?

528
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
I don't know.

529
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
I don't know.

530
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
I don't know.

531
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't know.

532
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
I don't know.

533
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Why can't you dance?

534
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
It's good to dance.

535
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Really?

536
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,920
It's been a long time since I practiced.

537
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
It's a simple demonstration.

538
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm a little nervous to dance a song.

539
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
It doesn't look very easy.

540
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
It's a little difficult.

541
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
It's easy.

542
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Then you have to watch the show later.

543
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
I want to watch it.

544
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I want to watch it.

545
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
You want to watch it first?

546
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Then wait for me.

547
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll change my clothes.

548
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
This way.

549
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,920
I didn't tell you about the dance performance before.

550
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Why didn't you tell me?

551
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Because this is the new gift I gave you.

552
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
You look like a little girl.

553
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
You're handsome.

554
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
You're pretty.

555
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
You look good.

556
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,920
When did you move in?

557
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Did you take the room decoration?

558
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Look at you.

559
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Look at when you have time.

560
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
Three months ago.

561
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Let's make it later.

562
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm empty at that time.

563
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Then is moving in the company

564
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Why didn't you turn on the light?

565
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:47,400
so good

566
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,740
I think we're not bad

567
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,740
Ask you a coward

568
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,500
When you were on the stage,

569
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,180
it seemed like it would be aired.

570
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,500
But I didn't want to let others see it.

571
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,980
I only want to let you be aired in the world.

572
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,500
But I can't do it.

573
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,220
You should...

574
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,540
You should let them see me.

575
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,580
I can be your substitute forever.

576
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,580
I thought about it for the first time.

577
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,660
I said I love you.

578
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,660
I forgot to say I love you.

579
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,620
The distance will take me all the way.

580
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:57,300
Let me be without you.

581
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,340
I only want to let you be.

582
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,260
Shuang Qing.

583
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,580
Yes?

584
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Give me a break.

585
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,100
I said I love you.

586
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,340
I forgot to say I love you.

587
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,420
The distance will take me all the way.

588
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Let me be without you.

589
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,420
I said I love you.

590
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:54,300
How can I say I love you?

591
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,300
I always like to replace you with my eyes.

592
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:02,300
I thought about it for the first time.

593
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,300
I said I love you.

594
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,300
I forgot to say I love you.

595
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,300
The distance will take me all the way.

596
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Let me be without you.

597
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,700
Why did you keep it from him?

598
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,700
Or are you really afraid that they will be behind you?

599
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,300
I didn't do it. I was afraid that others would misunderstand.

600
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,700
Then why did you leave?

601
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,300
Because there is no thing worth leaving me here.

602
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Then will you rest or go to another workplace?

603
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
At that time, I will meet other male colleagues.

604
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,100
I don't have any.

605
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,100
I suddenly want to go back to Nan Wu.

606
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

607
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

608
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

609
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

610
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

611
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

612
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

613
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

614
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,100
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

615
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

616
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

617
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

618
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

619
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

620
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

621
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

622
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

623
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

624
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,660
I want to go back to Nan Wu.

625
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,660
Okay

626
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
Excuse me

627
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,820
I'd like to order thepiercy raw materials

628
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
How much is it?

629
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,820
Half of this way

630
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,020
Can I transfer the suppliers?

631
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,960
Please give me the girl with blue outfits

632
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,660
I just want to say that

633
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,660
the event in the store

634
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,660
will be sent to Fei Song

635
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
when he sends a friend.

636
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,660
Thank you.

637
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
It's okay.

638
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,660
Miss, hello.

639
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
This is our new product.

640
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,660
No need, thank you.

641
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
In this way,

642
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
if you send a friend's circle

643
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
to promote it to us,

644
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
this cake

645
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
will be sent to you.

646
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Remember to send a friend's circle.

647
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
The heart that used to be hot

648
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
will also start to doubt

649
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,660
the firmness that is chasing in the ice.

650
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
But you never gave up

651
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,660
My every effort

652
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,660
has its meaning.

653
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
With the time,

654
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,660
we wait together.

655
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
The sun shines,

656
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
warmth is warm and cold

657
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,660
gives me light.

658
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,660
It's you in the wind

659
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,660
that doesn't want me to come.

660
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,660
It's you who always stand by me

661
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,660
and stand by me.

662
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,660
This road is hard to stop.

663
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,660
The rain is full of land.

664
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,660
But I have you.

665
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,660
The sun shines,

666
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,660
warmth is warm and cold.

667
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
All the thoughts,

668
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
all the memories

669
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
are you in them.

670
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
We are youth,

671
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,660
every shadow.

672
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,660
Every rain,

673
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
you are the one I want to be with.

674
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,660
I am not a pervert.

675
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,660
Every time I call you,

676
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,660
I want to tell you the most.

677
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,660
We will make a journey together.

678
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,660
I will not give up.

679
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:55,660
I will be here with you.

680
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,660
It's you in the wind

681
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,660
that doesn't want me to come.

682
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,660
It's you who always stand by me

683
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,660
and stand by me.

684
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,660
This road is hard to stop.

685
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,660
The rain is full of land.

686
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,660
But I have you.

687
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,660
I will not give up.

688
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I will not give up.

689
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,660
It's you who always stand by me

690
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,660
and stand by me.

691
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,660
It's you who always stand by me.

692
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,660
Every rain,

693
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,660
you are the one I want to be with.

694
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,660
I am not a pervert.

695
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,660
Every time I call you,

696
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,660
I want to tell you the most.

697
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,660
We will make a journey together.

698
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,660
We will make a journey together.

699
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,660
I will not give up.

700
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,660
I will be here with you.
