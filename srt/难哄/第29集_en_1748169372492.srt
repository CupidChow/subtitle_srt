00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Ep 21

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I will be brave and patient for you

3
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,000
The world is following me, what's the point of being brave?

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
I will be brave and patient for you

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
The world is following me, what's the point of being brave?

6
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,600
I will be brave and patient for you

7
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,200
The world is following me, what's the point of being brave?

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,800
I will be brave and patient for you

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,800
The world is following me, what's the point of being brave?

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:37,400
I will be brave and patient for you

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,400
I have loved you before

12
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,400
You are not good at your name, you can't beat me

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,200
You are a failure and a surrender

14
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,400
No, are you a surrender or a general?

15
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
General

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Then you are wrong, aren't you a general?

17
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
General

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you going to be assigned?

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,200
Oh, right, I might not be very late in the future

20
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,000
I am a little busy with the right-hand practice

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I am afraid that you will tell me about it in advance

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will contact you if I have time

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Later, I really never saw him on the line

25
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
I haven't seen him for a long time

26
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
You are still playing?

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,400
I found out this game on your phone suddenly

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,000
I just came to see you

29
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,400
How is the game going?

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not good

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I just came to see you

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just came to see you

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I just came to see you

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just came to see you

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not good

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't live happily

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But I can only live like this

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have something to do, I will leave now

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Goodbye

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Second Prize

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Auntie

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,280
Genejie is here, top

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It is a good one for a month

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, thank you

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've been wondering why you don't post on the internet

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and why you want to take a plane to a river.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll come and visit you later.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you.

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hello, Mr. Shen.

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, I'm a reporter for the River Daily.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's about the group's new project yesterday.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can you explain it to me?

53
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So there are a few simple questions.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The first question is,

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The first question is,

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The first question is,

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The first question is,

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The first question is,

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The first question is,

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The first question is,

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
what is the most important thing in the world?

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Zeyuan.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why are you so cruel?

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
How can I be cruel?

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's something that I've been through.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're a girl.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you do anything to make me sorry?

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For example?

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
For example,

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
maybe I'm 70 or 80 years old.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't find my boyfriend.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Finally, an old man has seen my boyfriend.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
When I was in my late 20s,

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
my old man had a crush on you.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, I'm here to

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
find you a boyfriend.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll change my hair.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You should have a better life.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What kind of life?

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm just asking you,

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
do you want me to change my hair?

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you want it?

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can do it.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But you owe me a lot.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Fine.

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then, I'll owe you a lot.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After 40 years,

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
50 years.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
50 years is my life.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you want to get married?

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll get married after a week.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you have anything to say?

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I need to get double-edged.

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll get it back.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Isn't that more serious?

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's not serious.

105
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is that so?

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll do it myself.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Double-edged.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're quite sick now.

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sick?

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm afraid you can't get out.

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why are you so fierce today?

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I said I'd be angry.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're still angry?

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're already well-behaved in the hospital.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why are you so angry now?

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not well-behaved for you.

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,000
You're very bright.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you really angry?

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're too dates depicted by my appearance.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I wanted you to get married to me.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Even though you're not your ex.

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Maybe,

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it's because you love your girl just now.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll go get some medicine.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I want to see you eat.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm hungry.

127
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm hungry.

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm hungry.

129
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm hungry.

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm hungry.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm hungry.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm hungry.

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm hungry.

134
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Aren't you sleepy?

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll go to bed.

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll go wash up.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can't get water in your wound.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know. I'll wipe it off.

139
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you angry?

140
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How long do you want to stay with me?

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I just want to see

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
how I can help you.

143
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I just said that I'll go wash up.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What do you want to do?

145
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I can do it.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What can you do?

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll go to bed.

148
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't need to help me.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But your wound is so strong.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll take care of it.

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll take care of it.

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Good night.

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Be careful.

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you need anything, just tell me.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I know.

156
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What are you doing?

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to help you wash up.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm the one who needs it.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's not what I want.

160
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll help you.

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm afraid that you can't wipe it off yourself.

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't wipe it off behind you.

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I know.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What if you wipe it off

165
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and you can't get the tissue?

166
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Dad.

167
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Dad.

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're not afraid of me.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm afraid.

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll do it myself.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then,

172
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
wipe your own legs.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
After you wipe them off,

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
are you ready to sleep?

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've had it so long.

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was still sleepy just now.

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You think that

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm hurt.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I can't do it.

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Really?

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't do it either.

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What's the matter?

184
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You want to go to the bathroom?

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Please.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll wash it off.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then, you can do it.

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You...

What are you doing here at night?

Nothing.

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why are you crying?

219
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
My father...

220
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
...not only asked me to write it.

221
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because of this, he quarreled with your father.

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What did you write?

223
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Can you show me?

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Maybe you shouldn't talk about being a prostitute instead.

232
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,620
Something didn't健ubs contain or sleepent my own thoughts.

233
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,340
What is this little kid's death ordinance?

234
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,120
Help me put the young issue of one to the next.

235

I'm not yet accepted.

236
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,520
I won't take you in.

237
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,900
Let me help you sleep with it.

238
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,260
八点的妈妈老Harry,

239
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,920
I want to drop the trap!

240
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,700
What are you doing!

241
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,140

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,780
I don't want to die.

245
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,020
You two, calm down.

246
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,180
Don't cry.

247
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,460
Jianer.

248
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,260
You're the only one

249
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,540
who can save me, right?

250
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,700
Xiaoyao, you're the most hurtful one.

251
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,620
Help me.

252
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,100
Your father is hurt.

253
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,180
You don't help me.

254
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,100
I can't live.

255
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,020
I'm so scared.

256
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,900
I beg you, Jianer.

257
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Jianer, I beg you.

258
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,100
Jianer, I beg you.

259
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,580
I beg you.

260
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,580
I beg you.

261
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,740
I beg you.

262
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm not scared.

263
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,620
I beg you.

264
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,540
I'm sorry, Guo Lian.

265
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm sorry, Zhang Yi.

266
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,020
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,940
I've done so many things

268
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,420
to kill a girl

269
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,740
because I can't hold on

270
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,300
to love

271
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,220
myself to their kindness, okay?

272
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,180
The mistake I made

273
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,060
was the greatest

274
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,700
sentence

275
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,380
that had killed her.

276
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I am guilty

277
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
I declare

278
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500

283
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
307

284
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
The verdict is as follows

285
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
All rise

286
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
All rise

287
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
The defendant, Che Xingde

288
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
committed a crime of deliberately killing people

289
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500

and took away the political power

293
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500

and decided to execute him to death

297
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500

and committing a crime of illegal crime

302
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Sister

303
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
This report is not long

304
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Is the shooting today over?

305
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
It's finally over

306
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
It's finally over

307
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
It's finally over in my life

308
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It's finally over in my life

309
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
It's fine

310
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
You like the boy

311
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
It's also very brave

312
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Thank you for protecting yourself

313
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,740
protect yourself.

314
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm sorry, dad.

315
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Hello, uncle Guo.

318
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Thank you for your kind words.

319
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
I finally got it right.

320
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I represent Guo Ling.

321
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I'm a good person.

322
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm a good person.

323
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm a good person.

324
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
I'm a good person.

325
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I'm a good person.

326
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
I'm a good person.

327
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
I'm a good person.

328
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
I represent Guo Ling.

329
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Thank you.

330
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
I should do this.

331
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
For Lin Lin.

332
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
And for myself.

333
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
This case's success and failure

334
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,500
is a strong support for the social justice.

335
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
It's also important to the victims

336
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
and their families.

337
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Because I look like a ruin.

338
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Even though I have no right to change,

339
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I would like to give my life to this workspace.

340
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,960
I want to

341
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,500
bring back these self-timer sahabas in recording bikes.

342
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,500
So I can attract support from these people.

343
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,620
And kill these 你 Sama

344
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,600
people to give me strength.

345
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Everyone,

346
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
keep your faith and säabat.

347
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,540
Yap.

348
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,340
Old Dark Cat and a馮.

349
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,020
Don't leave.

350
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,700
Oh, I need to talk to you.

351
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Hello, Master.

352
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
The phone number is 1224.

353
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Your sister wants to report you.

354
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
If you have time,

355
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
do you want to go to her house?

356
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Are you going?

357
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
I'm not planning to.

358
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Do you want to eat?

359
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Of course.

360
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Of course.

361
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
My hand is really...

362
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Jin Reng Guo Ling's father...

363
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
called me again.

364
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
What did he say?

365
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
He said...

366
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
thank you for reporting me.

367
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
And thank you for being so considerate.

368
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
That's probably what he meant.

369
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
But I think this is all my job.

370
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
I'm not a good person.

371
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm not a good person.

372
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I'm not a good person.

373
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm not a good person.

374
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm not a good person.

375
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
I think this is all my job.

376
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
This is not a good job.

377
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
This is your job.

378
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
You don't have to be so broad.

379
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Actually, I didn't like...

380
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
to be a reporter.

381
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Why?

382
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
It has nothing to do with this industry.

383
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
I just think...

384
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
everything is the same except dancing.

385
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Why did you go to the library?

386
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
To improve myself.

387
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I did it for two reasons.

388
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
It's because I started to write.

389
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Zeyan.

390
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Have you ever thought...

391
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
if one day we can go to...

392
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
a place without people knowing us...

393
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,500
we can even change the name.

394
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Is this how we can throw it away...

395
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
and start over?

396
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Is this the reason why you...

397
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
made up for it twice?

398
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
I don't understand for the first time.

399
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I think you're better.

400
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
What about the second time?

401
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
The second time...

402
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I thought I left.

403
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
He didn't hurt your needs.

404
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I understand.

405
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
I want to protect you.

406
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
If I...

407
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
didn't want to see the people...

408
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
who are so poor...

409
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
maybe this is the only way...

410
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
to start over.

411
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
But as you said,

412
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I still want to thank you...

413
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
for your experience in Hong Kong.

414
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
You...

415
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I can't keep my word.

416
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
I know.

417
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Do you know what?

418
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I know you're not willing to give up.

419
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
I know I'm very good at it.

420
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
You're so ugly.

421
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Chen Xiaoming.

422
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
You still want to dance?

423
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
I don't want to.

424
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I don't want to.

425
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
You still want to dance?

426
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
If I go back a few years ago,

427
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
I should still think about it.

428
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Now?

429
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Now...

430
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I wrote down the news report...

431
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,500
last night and received...

432
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Guo Ming's father's number.

433
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
I suddenly realized...

434
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
that I still like to write down...

435
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
my heart's feelings.

436
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Need to change the198 Project in Hong Kong?

437
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,500
I...

438
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
I just only think of yours.

439
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm curious.

440
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,500
What about you?

441
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
I like dancing.

442
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
You just...

443
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
danced when you were looking for the right time.

444
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Before, I liked dancing a lot.

445
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
Look.

446
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
It's this one.

447
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
Hello, I want a bag.

448
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Thank you.

449
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Okay. I have a bag.

450
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,500
The packaging is quite delicate.

451
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Is that it?

452
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,500
It's delicious.

453
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
It's delicious.

454
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,740
It's not sweet. It's really heavy.

455
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,260
You're quite strange to the candy-eating standard.

456
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,700
It's not sweet.

457
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,460
Let me try.

458
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,500
You're lying.

459
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,380
It's quite sweet.

460
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,620
Do you want to try it?

461
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,940
It's just a candy-eating standard.

462
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,980
It's not about the taste.

463
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,500
Do you understand?

464
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,980
What are you looking for?

465
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,380
Rui.

466
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,220
Wang Dong said he wanted to take back his money

467
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,100
and move it to the market before March.

468
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,140
March?

469
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Then it'll be good to talk about it for half a year.

470
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
What?

471
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
What?

472
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
It's not good.

473
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
How come you suddenly have to work for half a year?

474
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
What are you thinking about?

475
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,140
I mean it.

476
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,100
Then...

477
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,100
How do you jump off the top of the mountain?

478
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
I've never paid attention to others.

479
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Usually, I only get married after a long time.

480
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Usually, it's pretty fast.

481
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,100
We get married a few days after a few weeks.

482
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
It's too long.

483
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I'll talk about it again in a few years.

484
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
You want to talk about it for a long time?

485
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,100
Fine.

486
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
It's all my fault.

487
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
You're still thinking about me?

488
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,100
If I had been in the sea a few years ago,

489
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
I should still think about it.

490
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Why do you really know about Yuan You today?

491
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm just a little bit.

492
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,100
I just want to talk about it for a few more years.

493
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm just a little bit.

494
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I'm just a little bit.

495
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,100
I just want to talk about it for a few more years.

496
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I'm just a little bit.

497
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
I really know Yuan You.

498
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
So I'm going to change into a guide?

499
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,100
You're the one who's been waiting for me.

500
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
No one can stop me.

501
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,100
That day, my family...

502
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
was burned to death by someone.

503
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,100
I don't know if I can ever hide this time.

504
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,100
Mr. Ren Shuang.

505
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,100
I just want to keep talking about these things

506
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
until you leave.

507
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Besides, I'm always there for you

508
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
when you want to do anything.

509
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,100
Don't let your life be too tough.

510
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Our lives are still long.

511
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
We don't eat anything now.

512
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Everything is up to you.

513
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Did you hear that?

514
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Zeya.

515
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I'm different from before.

516
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I was so weak and weak.

517
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
I didn't have any strength.

518
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,100
But now, I can do whatever I want.

519
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I don't need to care about others' face.

520
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
Because I have you now.

521
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
And I really like the job of a journalist.

522
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,100
All my thoughts have been put on this.

523
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm going to give up on doing other things.

524
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm not happy about it.

525
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
And I can be like you.

526
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Like me?

527
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,100
You have a husband and wife.

528
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
If I want to keep dancing,

529
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I can be his wife.

530
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
That's good.

531
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Do you think

532
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,100
you can take my dad down for me?

533
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
No.

534
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,100
Just hold me tight this time.

536
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
If you want to edit the text,

537
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,100
click on this part.

538
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
And then here,

539
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
click on it.

540
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Your dad,

541
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,100
the boss wants to see you.

542
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
What?

543
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Tell him.

544
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Director, you want to see me?

545
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Have a try.

546
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,100
I'll come back to see you if there's any problem.

547
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,100
The last year's situation is still okay.

548
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,100
But you're the same every year.

549
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Director.

550
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Come in.

551
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,100
You want to see me?

552
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
Did you learn dance for ten years?

553
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
The meeting is coming.

554
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
You're preparing a show.

555
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
And you're sending us the light.

556
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,100
But I haven't finished the dance for a long time.

557
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
It's okay.

558
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I'm participating.

559
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
Please, Yifan.

560
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Just one show is enough.

561
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
I'm afraid I don't have time to practice.

562
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
And there are many reports later.

563
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Don't be stressed.

564
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Just have the mood.

565
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
No, no, no.

566
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Send Yifan's show to the press.

567
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
Okay.

568
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Okay.

569
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Go ahead.

570
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
I'm your brother.

571
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm more strict than you.

572
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
I'm more strict than you.

573
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Why doesn't my dad agree?

574
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Why do you say...

575
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
To be honest,

576
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,100
he's a little old.

577
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,100
I'm also telling the truth.

578
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Hello?

579
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Zhizhi.

580
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
What's wrong?

581
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,100
He said he wanted to take Duan Jiaxu home.

582
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
But my parents didn't agree.

583
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Why didn't they agree?

584
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I think he's a little old.

585
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Why?

586
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
After all, he's a little older.

587
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Did you come home with me

588
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,100
last year?

589
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
But if uncle and aunt

590
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
don't agree,

591
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
why don't we go together?

592
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
My parents are not so good to me.

593
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
They're just good to my daughter.

594
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
Say it again.

595
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Do you have time on 22nd?

596
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
22nd?

597
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
What's wrong?

598
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
We had a concert on TV.

599
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
I sang a song with Tian.

600
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I said I could take Jiaxu home.

601
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Jiaxu?

602
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Jiaxu has time.

603
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Shao.

604
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
Did you make it today?

605
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Almost.

606
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
You can't just use my phone.

607
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Can you?

608
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
You have to be professional.

609
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
You...

610
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
How's Yifan?

611
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
She's fine.

612
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Okay.

613
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Get ready.

614
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
Here we go.

615
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
You have to leave.

616
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Can you move?

617
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Okay.

618
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
It's hot.

619
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
The guest had to leave.

620
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Doctor.

621
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
How is your canceled, Yifan?

622
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Nearly perfect.

623
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,400
There are no obvious

624
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,720
But I suggest you to come to the hospital next week

625
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,680
and take a look at the recovery situation.

626
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,240
You should take the time to consider the problem.

627
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,360
Next week, right?

628
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,280
Next Monday.

629
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,040
October 24th, okay?

630
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,320
The day of the double-disc.

631
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,840
It's a special day.

632
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,520
I can't understand.

633
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,080
Hello, auntie.

634
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,400

635
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,520
Hahaha, dear!

636
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,600
