1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I don't do it, it's my job.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm closing the door.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm coming.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then, wave your hands and bend them softly while breathing.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One, two, mu, mu, three, four.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mu, mu, mu.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ah, ah, I want to be in your heart.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I want to hold your heart tight.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm glad I'm not happy.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm happy to be alive in balance.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not enough yet.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to be in your heart.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't take you away from me.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My eyes are filled with tears.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like a spinning ball.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to the summer day with my hands up and running.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The End

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not doing it.

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Call the lawyer.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is the meal ready yet?

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Everyone, be quiet.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The meal is ready yet.

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you don't behave, you'll get a bad heart condition.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Anamori-chan, please forgive me.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a cat.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's so cute.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's so relaxing.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is the meal ready yet?

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm the therapy cat here.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm just pretending.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm investigating whether this is the kind of species that humans should be living on this earth.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And this is the Earthling's partner.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We call him Holder.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Anamori Junichiro.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the watchtower of the detention center.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm just pretending.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm the agent for the police chief and police officer's special police department.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm supposed to be.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And then the owner was surprised to see me and fell.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I had no choice but to put him on the number 119.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is a secret, Anamori-chan.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's a painful decision.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Anamori, you can't be the agent even if you're pretending.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No, Tanaka-san's story is crazy.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's why you can't call the agent by name.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's why people call you Anamori Shimanagashi in the shadows.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can hear you.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The cat is saying something.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The cat can't talk.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't eat yet.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Safe.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please move away, Anamori-san.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm the watchtower, Beacon-chan.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please come in.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You fell.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You were a graduate of the police school.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm annoyed to see you.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm here, Irayla-neechan.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Shut up, criminals.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The discrimination is against you.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You look like a dead old lady.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're following me because you can't be a watchtower.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, don't you know Anamori?

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Anamori, do you really hate the earthlings?

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is a warning.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm afraid it's a little troublesome.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Beacon!

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This way again.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But this way is...

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I see.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This old lady is busy with her investigation.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anamori!

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well...

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Tanuko Yamanaka.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go, Beacon.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Anamori, this is your chance to find your grandmother and get her back.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Siberia is now trying to resist the police.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've fought against the warlike people who fight with such instinct.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But they're still beasts.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Being instinctive is analog.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If I were to compare it to that, it's like the first-ever Earth's carnivores.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Based on the starting point, it's the first carnivore that was roughly calculated with a gyro sensor.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's enough!

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're good at studying.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Of course.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't move around with random calculations.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
According to the report, the current carnivore uses a GPS system.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Recently, there's a game that uses that GPS.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The GPS is the same one that your grandmother dropped, right?

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It seems so.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
GPS location is determined by using the four satellite information of Earth's roundness, X-Y axis, height, and time.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The first satellite indicates that it's somewhere in the distance.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The second satellite limits the range.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The third one limits it to two points.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Finally, it limits it to one point by considering Earth's roundness.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's amazing. You're using that to watch over your grandmother and children.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You really feel the times.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's make those dogs bark with this scientific power, Anamori.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You mean pulling the records from the GPS that your grandmother dropped and narrowing down the places that could be seen from that watch?

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's it! As expected of Anamori!

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think you're already doing it, but let's try as much as we can.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, it's me.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Can I ask you a favor?

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It says it'll take some time before the analysis is over.

105
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I came all the way here, and the Earthlings are...

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Huh?

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sakurako, I bought this kitchen knife at the cultural festival the other day.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't hear the sound well.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, this is a wireless earphone.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can record the sound from the outside and make it louder, but I need a pair of these.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Huh? The Earthlings are...

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
When did they come?

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The cell phone is...

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's a smartphone!

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The demon bride is...

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The world we're going through is full of demon brides!

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, that's true.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sakurako, you're good at recognizing homo sapiens individually.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can see all men or women the same way.

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I wonder if that's what aliens think.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can still identify the aliens!

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sakurako.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Are you still okay?

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes!

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Huh? A fraud?

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What should I do?

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I heard you were a fraud.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Who is this?

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to hear your story.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The toaster I bought the other day was completely different from what the clerk said.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I couldn't bake a single loaf of bread properly.

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's true.

135
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There might be a village in the finished product.

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is this the only way to trick people?

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Moon has no problem at all!

138
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can eat more!

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Senpai!

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Shut up!

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I thought the toaster was expensive and suspicious, but I liked the shape and shape.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a trick to trick the elderly.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If that's the case, then humans are...

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's cute, isn't it?

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
My grandmother's house is decorated with cute little things.

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's like a European grocery store and it's nice.

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Really? Thank you.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So let's try a little harder.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Please leave it to me for a while.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't have time to do this, but I'm going to be woke up.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is an important job, too.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A toaster that can't bake well?

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, that's a convection oven.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Convection oven?

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is it different from a toaster?

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
To put it bluntly, toasters and ovens are basically not compatible with the system.

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Toasters are machines to bake bread, as the name implies, and have low temperature settings.

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oven and grill have increased the number of heaters and the temperature has increased.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But now toasters and ovens are singing the song of the waterfall.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Both are the era of power.

161
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Toaster era?

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a gold infrared heater.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The outside of the curry bread is not burnt, and the inside is hot.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Twin bird's Takumi Branche Toaster.

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Can you wait?

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hit it with the firepower of Kansai!

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Toaster that can bake in seconds!

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A magic lamp that has been in the war overseas.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Suddenly, someone who doesn't look like the Sengoku era...

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Toaster that can cook rice at high temperatures with a wide interior!

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's a pop-up, but you can see the inside!

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's amazing, Aladdin!

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Toaster is a fire-burning agent of the Sengoku era, Balmuda.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It bakes bread with water using a heat-resistant water heater.

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
On top of that, it sings the best temperature management with microns.

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Um...

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Baking bread with water?

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No matter how much you heat it, the water only rises to 100 degrees.

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If you cross the point of the foot and get on the water heater, you can heat it up more.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's what a heat-resistant water heater is.

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Sharp's Helo-Sio is made with this heat-resistant water heater for all the cooking processes.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It removes any excess salt and oil and makes it healthy.

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, if you only use a heat-resistant water heater,

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:11,260
you can enjoy the atmosphere just by blowing water into a

185
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
It's a great way to make bread.

186
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,260
But you have to adjust the temperature and time for each cooking process,

187
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,260
so it's a waste of time to get used to it.

188
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,260
Well, you need to be prepared to use new things.

189
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:31,260
Depending on how you use it, the more time you spend, the better your work.

190
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,260
There's a good understanding of machines.

191
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,260
So, if you're an old man,

192
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,260
it might be better to use a simple switch to bake bread.

193
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Oh, is that so?

194
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Understanding machines...

195
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
That's right.

196
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:06,260
I heard that you can try many different dishes with this toaster.

197
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,260
I thought something might change.

198
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
An old man died,

199
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,260
and children grew up and left.

200
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,260
I think I'm going to die.

201
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,260
I can't see the changes in my life.

202
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,260
I just do the same thing every day.

203
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,260
If I'm living like that,

204
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
I wonder what it's like.

205
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,260
If an alien comes and sees me,

206
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,260
I don't know if it's an old man or an old woman.

207
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,260
I think I'm an unidentifiable existence.

208
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
That's what I think.

209
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Maybe I was a little too excited.

210
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,260
That's certainly useful, too.

211
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,260
It doesn't fit in this room.

212
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
This toaster design matches

213
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:26,260
with my grandma's Italian interior.

214
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Because...

215
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,260
This is also an Italian brand.

216
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Pizza

217
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Let's bake pizza.

218
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,260
My senior taught me that this toaster is made of pizza stone.

219
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Pizza?

220
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,260
It's a circular infrared radiation from pizza stone,

221
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,260
which is heated by a high-temperature hot air without a village.

222
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,260
It tastes like a pizza dough.

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Let's eat.

224
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,260
The dough is crispy.

225
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,260
It's oily and salty.

226
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,260
The doctor stopped him.

227
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,260
I often argued with him that I wanted to eat it,

228
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,260
but I wish I could eat it with him more.

229
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,260
It's delicious.

230
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,260
Thank you, Sakurako.

231
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,260
I'm used to the convection oven,

232
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,260
but I often can't take that step in the convection oven.

233
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,260
But I'm glad I could take it.

234
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
It's been a while since I've seen it.

235
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
So...

236
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,260
I'm glad I bought it, too.

237
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,260
This oven.

238
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,260
Right, old man?

239
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Memories...

240
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Memories...

241
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Um, thank you very much.

242
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
I didn't do anything.

243
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
It's all thanks to you, Sakurako.

244
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,260
But I'm glad you were with me.

245
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Thank you very much.

246
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
You're a good girl.

247
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Yeah.

248
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,260
Oh, it's a timely call.

249
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,260
I got the results of the GPS analysis.

250
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,260
Beko!

251
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Stay! Stay!

252
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Hey.

253
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
Anamori!

254
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,260
Why are you here?

255
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Is Tanuko here?

256
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,260
I don't remember your face at all!

257
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm popular!

258
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I always get a foot massage here.

259
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Or maybe it's because the smell here is too strong.

260
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Beko!

261
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
I'll buy it for you later!

262
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
The smell is flowing.

263
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,260
I think we should hurry up a little.

264
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Hurry up? What's on your mind?

265
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Sakurako gave me a hint.

266
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Sakurako?

267
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Who?

268
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,260
It's not like I want anything new and convenient.

269
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,260
The GPS data is accurate.

270
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,260
But the latest map was no good.

271
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Because the map in your grandma's house...

272
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,260
is the same as it was in the past.

273
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,260
That karaage shop was a old-fashioned candy shop.

274
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,260
I remembered Akamatsu-san from the Ryuchijo who was the first to go there.

275
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,260
This was a school.

276
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,260
This was a playground.

277
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,260
Tanuko-san is looking for the scenery she used to see.

278
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,260
She's lost in this town.

279
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I have to pick her up.

280
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
This is...

281
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,260
A village that was built during the high-level economic growth.

282
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Tanuko-san used to live in a village before she moved in with her son.

283
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,260
But she was already taken over by the village.

284
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,260
She was ill with cognitive disorder and had forgotten about it.

285
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,260
She found this place over and over again.

286
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,260
This place is very similar to the village where her family lived.

287
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,260
Everyone mentions family to me.

288
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,260
Oh, hello.

289
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Is this give-hours gift section?

290
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
You all look happy.

291
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
You know...

292
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Um... Thank you.

293
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
It's not for you, though.

294
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,260
The technology of this Earth is not comparable to what we have.

295
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,260
But that technology is not only pursuing convenience,

296
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,260
but also to connect with someone.

297
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,260
And that might be the essence of Earth's technology.

298
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,260
It's a report from the war-torn world.

299
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
But...

300
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,260
I hope it will be a good judgment material for the Supreme Court.

301
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Sakurako!

302
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,260
I baked this in that oven.

303
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,260
Oven-ba-bam!

304
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
It's delicious!

305
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
It's well-baked.

306
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,260
It looks like the cat likes it too.

307
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
I'll give you more, Oven-bam!

308
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
It's well-baked.

309
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
It looks good.

310
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,380
Gunma

311
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:35,260
But anyway, I don't have enough time

312
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Let's go somewhere where there's no one

313
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,260
If I can get some rest

314
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,260
It's a wonderful day

315
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,260
Overflowing with power

316
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:02,260
I throw everything away and live

317
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Because you forget me

318
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:16,260
By then, I can see you right away

319
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,260
OK, you've lived well

320
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Huh?

321
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,780
品

322
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Here comes the sake Mits lifespan

323
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,260
Your memories are now disappointed

324
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,260
You are a smart old man and a mobile.

325
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,680
Let me ask

326
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,460
By the way You're the thief

327
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,980
You didn't want to ask

328
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Thanks
