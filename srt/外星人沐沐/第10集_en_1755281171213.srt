1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,800
Thank you for coming!

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,500
I've delivered the luggage.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,000
I caught a cold, but I was able to take care of you.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,700
You're a girl, so you'll be fine.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
You're my friend...

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's how it is.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Where are you going?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know what's right for you.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not living for you.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's exciting to see new things.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's get started.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The End

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know what's right for you.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not living for you.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's exciting to see new things.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's get started.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The End

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is this a Citroen?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a Zylvesta Citroen Latte Art!

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wow, it's a tomato!

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How do you make it?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, it's easy to make with this latest Ballista machine.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wow, I want it!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Show me!

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This machine is different from what you can do with clay, so be careful.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Show me!

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you fly from my Oista, you'll definitely make it.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wow, it's so cute!

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's popular, isn't it?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think I'll do it later.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's hot today.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sweating a lot.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's with that neck?

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a neck cooler.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's the latest version of the private cooler that uses Peltier.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Peltier?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
To put it simply, when you turn on the power, one side gets cold.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It hurts?

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not good for heat efficiency, but it's strong enough that you can cool it pinpoint without needing a refrigerant.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's strong!

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Above all, it's quiet because there's no wind.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Show me!

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's that?

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a mobile humidifier. You can sell it anywhere.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Show me!

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Samezu, this is the hot plate you used the other day.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a machine that can make takoyaki and ahi.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Takoahi!

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How far are you going to follow me?

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Um, this is a thank you for the cold.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Samezu, you're always surrounded by everyone, so the timing is...

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been wondering what you've been up to since morning.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What are you going to do about that weak appeal?

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's a fatal disease in Tokyo.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is a city.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The city is Tokyo, so it's a bit dark.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In this state, Akiro is not an enemy either.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right. You don't like Japanese sweets very much, do you?

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go up and eat together.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today is the day I'll teach this Northland woman.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The difference in the angle!

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It opened on its own!

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What? Have you ever seen a door remote control auto lock?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's a car, too, and it's common sense these days.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course. The door to the house, too.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wow!

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's wonderful.

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sakurako, be careful. You're a suspicious one.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nyan.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Reba.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The lighting is not too dark today.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Nyan.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wow! It's a future that there's a robot at home!

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There's a Sharp logo book, right? It's the same as that.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Nyan.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Tall vanilla, no fat, solid, short chocolate sauce, mash mash whip, coffee subton,

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
jelly and oil mash mash, creamy vanilla latte.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Huh?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Nyan.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's nothing else on the camera.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can check the room anytime.

87
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can help and use the mousepad.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're smart.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You know that spell, too.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're smart.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're just transferring the voice of the user to cloud-like AI via the Internet.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's just a camera, speaker and microphone terminal shaped like a cat.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ah.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But, well...

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's pretty cute to move and dance, though it's pretty cute!

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Nyan.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This cute thing.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you know what this is? This hokuriko?

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's shiny.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is the cute thing.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not going to ask you about that.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Nyan.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hmm.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It can move like that?

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Amazing, amazing!

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Nyan!

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not amazing at all!

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In the era when the concept of individual households was still in the star of Mu,

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
when the home appliances AI made by a company that was determined by some compra was connected with your Internet-like things...

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Did you debug it?

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's good that it's a paid beta.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Their rebellion has happened, Mu!

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's hot!

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's hot!

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's hot!

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Later, the history called this day the Spring Festival.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It feels good.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So, you can't forgive this kind of person!

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But, it's amazing.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't use it that much.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The settings and all.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In the first place, the Wi-Fi is turned off immediately.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was a one room, right?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How much of a shabby router do you use?

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If that's the case...

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What if I wrap an aluminum foil in a cardboard box and put it behind the router?

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The router is sending a signal all around, but...

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you put it in the corner of the room, it will be easier to connect if you reflect and have a thought process.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Amazing!

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're so good at it, Mr. Samesu!

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why do you know that?

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's not that bad.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If you try it with a useless thing...

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But, don't you do it, Mr. Samesu?

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, no. That's too lame.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Listen.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Lame is...

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
To take the best moment!

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
To make the best latte art, you need an expensive body,

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and an expensive coffee potion and milk.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Every time you make it, you need to wash it.

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The small parts and the narrow mouth.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Of course, you can't wash it with a food washing machine, so you have to wash it all.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It won't work at once, so you have to repeat it until you're satisfied.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But...

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't put that kind of suffering in your head!

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Bye!

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What?

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think...

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Samesu is shining,

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and Mr. Samesu is working hard.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I think both of them are wonderful.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm being cheeky, aren't I?

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But I want to cheer for Mr. Samesu, who is working hard.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you saying?

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't show that side of me to Akihiro.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, whatever.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't be so rude, Destorah!

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sakurako!

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I knew she was trying to rebel!

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That was dangerous!

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You bitch!

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're going to get your friend back!

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Man, I have to pay for the cat food.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I think I saw a link to Mr. Samesu's food.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is...

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is...

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It can't be...

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What is it, Mom?

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mom?

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is the online shopping going well?

172
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's good.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
How's Dad's back?

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I see.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll just have to buy some food until he calms down.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You're still talking about that?

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's not all.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Bye.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I just gave it a try, and it's really growing.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Mr. Samesu is shining.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Mr. Samesu is working hard.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think both of them are wonderful.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That guy...

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That woman is talking bad about me.

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That woman is talking bad about me.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Mr. Samesu wouldn't say that.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you for everything.

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I ordered this.

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's here.

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not here again.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I have to get rid of the list of things I want.

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
List of things you want?

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
List of things you want is a service that lists what you want in the online shopping service.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But if you open the list, you can check the list and give it away.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Wow, this is great.

197
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's put it in the list of things you want.

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, Sakurako.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You want that?

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll give it to you.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What a surprise.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's the list of things you want.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you.

204
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll buy you whatever you want.

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The public is happy to receive presents.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The person who sent it is happy to receive the gift.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a win-win system.

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is this okay?

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Is something suspicious getting in my way?

210
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Someone's here.

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hello, Maru.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're beautiful today, Sakurako.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm going to film, so be quiet.

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh.

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Kitten TV

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hey, Mumu.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I've been thinking about this for a while.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll post this video on my Instagram or on my YouTube channel.

220
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is it okay to do something so obvious?

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're just angry at Siberia.

222
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Senpai, please be more self-reliant.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, my.

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is an important test to understand the history of home appliances.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The history of home appliances?

226
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The camera on your smartphone.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why do you think there are cameras on the many dots on the double-sided store?

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Speaking of which, why, Maru?

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
As the information society progressed from the mid-show to the mid-life,

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
cameras were both a luxury and a symbol of wealth.

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It was natural for the double-sided store to overflow.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The boom of video cameras, the black ship from the home appliances industry,

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
came to the camera market.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It didn't take long for the home appliances to line up next to the luxury camera showroom.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A camera and home appliances can't be cut off.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Certainly.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Looking at the full lineup for video shooting,

238
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I feel the strong ego of a human being in a camera.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Now, smartphones are very poor.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If it's just the number of images, it's not inferior to the digital number.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The number of images?

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Ouch!

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know the number of images.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't get angry.

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The number of images means how much detail you can take pictures and videos.

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,660
And humans have added a double-sided

247
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,000
number of images to their cameras!

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
At first, the digital camera, which was only 400,000 images,

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
became 10 times more in 20 years and now has a total of 10 million images!

250
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The digital camera's image number is now over 60 million!

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The inflation is amazing, Maru.

252
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Even a smartphone camera has a 12 million images.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And you can edit them, so anyone can show their own videos.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes, it's the era of 500 million co-creators!

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You've studied hard, Maru.

256
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Everything is for the development of technology.

257
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you study and upload a buzzing video,

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you should be able to understand the technology of cameras more deeply.

259
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You're right, Maru.

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But a buzzing video?

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you have any tips, Maru?

262
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I got a hint from a buzzing video when I used Self-Redi before.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You don't understand a cat as a decimals who misunderstands it as the ruler of this planet.

264
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When a cat that lives on its own seems to be acting with a certain intellectual logic,

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
people are moved.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
For example...

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can do it, cat.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But you can put the smell into the owner's mouth.

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, you!

270
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll give you more and more.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Is it an oyster toy?

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey, hey, check today's weather forecast.

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's so hot!

274
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This cat...

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's that woman from the North Pole.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Maybe she came here to steal my delicious technology?

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What a gorgeous country girl!

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And she's showing herself in a flash while saying that it's a cat video.

279
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In such a dark room!

280
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What the hell is this cat?

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why can you take such a video?

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
How do you control it?

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Huh? This...

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Huh?

285
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh no...

286
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is...

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh no, Moo!

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The flow has changed.

289
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The people who were fans until now have come to the fangs.

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Someone is trying to get rid of the cat.

291
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Someone is trying to get rid of the cat.

292
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Someone is trying to get rid of the cat.

293
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is a trigger for the trigger.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This cat is a normal cat.

295
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've been looking at cats for 10 years, so I know.

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey!

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're so information-oriented.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How suspicious are you, Moo?

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I know because I'm a laborer, but this isn't a joke.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You guys are so suspicious.

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Something is rubbing against me.

302
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm not going to stop anymore.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
A... a victim...

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a mat.

305
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Again?

306
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll wash you perfectly this time.

307
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's so stupid to use a trash can to fight, right?

309
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sakurako Umeyashiki.

310
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:43,100
I can't beat this 10-account's

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I can't beat this 10-account's

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
These guys...

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No way!

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Mom?

315
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What's wrong, Moo?

316
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm shooting right now, Moo!

317
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
There's a middle school student around the house.

318
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
He said he was a cat or a cat.

319
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Do you know what it is?

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This is really bad, Maru.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I know.

322
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
The evidence will be destroyed, Moo.

323
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What's going on between Sametsu and Anamori?

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't come out, Moo!

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey, Moo Moo!

327
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Moo... Moo's channel is gone, Moo.

328
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I can't delete an account that has more than 2 million subscribers.

329
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It hurts, Moo!

330
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Andrea!

331
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Who's your senior's idiot?

332
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Moo Moo...

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm going to visit the factory of the city of Panasonic.

334
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll go there first.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a cat gold!

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll upload it.

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I can't take permission to shoot!

338
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's easy to get a special feature for celebrities.

339
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm going to be a hero in the world of Zakuwa!

340
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Orange!

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's...

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It came out of nowhere.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The cat gold is a little strange.

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a cat gold.

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's a cat gold.

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's a cat gold.

347
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a cat gold.

348
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a cat gold.

349
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a cat gold.

350
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's a cat gold.

351
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's a cat gold.

352
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's a cat gold.

353
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a cat gold.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's a cat gold.

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's a cat gold.

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's a cat gold.

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's a cat gold.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's a cat gold.

359
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a cat gold.

360
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a cat gold.

361
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's a cat gold.

362
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's a cat gold.

363
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's a cat gold.

364
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a cat gold.

365
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a cat gold.

366
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a cat gold.

367
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's a cat gold.

368
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's a cat gold.

369
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's the first time I've been to the wood.

370
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The day I became a Vitecan Tropus.

371
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm getting closer.

372
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll be a monkey.

373
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll be a needle.

374
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm going to kill you.

375
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You're fighting me.

376
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm going to kill you.

377
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's open the off-campus.

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What happened?
