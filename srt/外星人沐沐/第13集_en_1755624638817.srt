Next Video

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
One, two, three!

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How can anyone's life be so light?

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wow, it's so cool!

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The university festival is really a festival!

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We were only in the bone group until yesterday, but we've changed!

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In addition to the exhibition of cultural products, there are many events such as hidden contests.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There are also events that invite celebrities in the afternoon.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's true! Amazing!

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Machida is a student city, so I'm just saying that I'm going to increase the sensitivity of the area with this kind of event.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a animal festival, isn't it? University.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't say that.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Wow, all of these are student shops, aren't they?

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm excited!

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm so happy to be able to live with a balanced body.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm happy to be normal.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I still have a lot to learn.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm so happy to be able to live with a balanced body.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't take out the small things in your heart.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Welcome!

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm the famous tennis player, German Frankfurt!

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you for waiting.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How is my audience?

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're so popular.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey, there's a really cute girl!

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Here she comes!

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Welcome! I'm the famous tennis player, Frankfurt!

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Huh?

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, so cute!

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's really cute!

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, my!

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Welcome!

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Please put your favorite person's name on this paper and carry it around without letting it go.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, yes! By the way, what's your name?

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Excuse me.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey!

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey,

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
can you change your name soon?

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Please, just a little bit more!

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, yes! Thanks to her, I can get all the stock!

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have plans from afternoon, so please wait until then.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, God, Buddha, and the smiling little girl!

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Stop it.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Welcome!

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Please give me two!

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want five! I want three!

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know what a smiling little girl is, but your country is still the same.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In this cultural festival, the school gives out a gift certificate to the students to liven up the atmosphere.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, so you can't use money.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then what about the sales?

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The university will pay the gift certificate.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In short, it's a gift certificate that was given when I was a little bit lost.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The guests don't complain, and it's time to earn the activity funds.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, that's why.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Every circle is a small one.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I see.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You mean the place where the dark place where the slaves open up.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're spreading money to the slaves and appealing your power.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course, our research club is no exception.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We have a lot of tools to improve the actual sales of appliances that have been repaired so far.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I want to exceed 100,000!

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
100,000?

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll do it.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Umeyashiki! Did you buy the ingredients I asked for?

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh, yes!

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And I also brought vegetables that my parents sent me.

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's delicious to eat raw.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The practical use of the cooking appliances is meaningful because they use what is sold around there.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a counterfeit.

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Use it properly.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's okay.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The vegetables from Umeyashiki are delicious.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The more delicious the better. Let's start the preparation.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes!

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Dear guests, please take a look.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is a unique, convenient, and unique home appliance that will definitely color your life.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Dad, what is it?

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've never seen it before.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
First, it's an authentic, self-made, and easy-to-use cooking appliance.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This electric pressure cooker is a micro-control that automatically controls the temperature and pressure.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can relax and relax even if you open your eyes.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Next, it's a representative of an auto-cooker.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's an automatic cook with a tool that you can poke with an arm for mixing.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I often forget that I recently put the pot on fire.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You've saved your life, old lady.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Take it easy.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Next, it's a simple, healthy salad chicken maker with one touch.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Everyone loves it. It's high protein.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Here, try it.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a yaki-imo maker.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's a yaki-imo maker.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can make it from the ones sold in the supermarket.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a child's snack.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Speaking of snacks, this is also a waffle maker.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can make a chewy waffle with a new sensation.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It looks convenient.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Can you really use this?

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
For example, if you use the automatic cook, you can make a dish that can be made by yourself from 100 people.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wow!

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Please try it.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It looks delicious. I'll eat it.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's delicious.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Can you make this with an auto-cooker?

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can you use it even if you're older?

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is easy.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Doesn't it smell delicious?

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you trying it?

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Really? Where?

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Where?

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Here, I'll introduce you to a handsome man.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go! Manage the woman!

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want the woman to try it first.

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's the hard part.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you don't mind, I'll take this.

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you, handsome man!

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's cool!

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's the home circuit of the Umeyashiki Sakurako.

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What's that line?

127
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Akira is using it for the soup!

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That guy!

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm so angry.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's okay. Leave it.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We can make a line here.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You have to earn money when you can earn it. Otherwise, you'll cry later.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Currently, the male guests are almost all single for a month.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Miss Campus is not a low-class company.

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then I'll become Miss Campus of this year and steal the guests!

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm burning!

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've been working hard for this day.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Miss Campus

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right! I did it!

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm a first-year student at Keikyuu University.

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm a first-year student at Keikyuu University.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I wanted to join Miss Campus because I wanted to grow as a student.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you for coming out this year, Miss Kagetsu!

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you ask me that much, I won't refuse.

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm glad I asked you.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There are many guests who are looking for you.

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you for waiting for a long time.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
From now on, Miss and Mr. Keikyuu University Contest will be held.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll introduce you to the candidates.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Entry No.1, Kagetsu Sonoko!

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Entry No.2, Samezu Miwa!

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Samezu, good luck!

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Entry No.3, Umeyashiki Sakurako!

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Why are you here?

155
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Entry No.4, Sakurako!

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Entry No.5, Sakurako!

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The finalists of Miss Campus are here!

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When did you get the entry?

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just now.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please give them a big round of applause!

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you sure?

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sakurako was struggling to get the entry.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She was struggling to get the entry.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why?

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And...

166
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Umeyashiki is surprisingly popular among the cultural departments.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
She deserves to be in the contest.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, I know that the cultural department will gather the votes, but what else?

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How will you gather the general votes?

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll let you go, from the bottom of Miss Campus.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now, it's time for self-appearance!

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Samezu Miwa will read the poem.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
In a dim place, with you...

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Eek!

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ah, why am I being dragged into a dim place?

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because darkness is the one who covers everything and hides it!

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I feel you, and my heart is filled with dark desires!

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I feel you, and my heart is filled with dark desires!

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Light, do not illuminate me!

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I seek the light of darkness!

181
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And I pray...

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In a dim place, the day I share my love with you...

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
...will not come!

184
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hey, Sugomi!

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you going to die, Samezu?

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yatsurumi, what are you doing?

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm being dragged into the air.

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How is it?

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've been practicing for this day.

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, what will the Northland women show us?

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll be a half-dressed Sakurako Umeyashiki.

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Half-dressed?

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're too plain to be my opponent.

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Eek!

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So cute!

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I-I'm done!

197
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm done!

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is a great meal!

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You're so naive to use a stray cat, you country girl.

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sonoko Kagetsu is going to be a half-dressed.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A half-dressed?

202
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
A half-dressed?!

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Seriously? You're kidding!

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That Kagetsu-san?!

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Wow!

206
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's gone!

207
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The fire is gone!

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Alright!

209
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Wow!

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You're really a smiley girl.

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Ah, the chief?

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
By the way, Mr. Campus chose you as the most impressive one.

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Toaster.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ah, you know this?

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's a toaster that makes bread delicious, right?

216
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Try it, handsome boy.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll take it home.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Stop it.

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's true that the toaster can be cooked with a heat-resistant steamer.

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's said that you can cook meat and fish, too.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But if you make a dish with a strong taste, it will smell.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You'll be interested in the smell of toast.

223
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What's wrong with this girl?

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, if you put this ozoneo nearby, it will smell better in a few hours.

225
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But my recommendation is this.

226
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Try putting a pan with water-soaked bread on it.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's crispy, and the inside is moist and soft.

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Even if you check it out...

229
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're not late.

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Right, Akihiro?

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Mr. Sametsu...

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I can't choose a way.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If you put on a lot of make-up and kick your opponent, the money you earn is just like mine.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You guys, why don't you come to my website instead of here?

235
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
In the first place, you should buy a home appliance in the second-hand store.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Because it's a condenser, which is an essential part of home appliances.

238
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a magnetic bomb that can break at any time.

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Condensers release electricity and stabilize it when the voltage changes greatly.

240
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The internal electrolyte liquid evaporates along with the specifications, and the power is not turned on at the end.

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The expiration date is close.

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That woman is closer to Sakurako than I am, Muu.

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not sure if I can think of a solution to that.

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What?

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
A daily home appliance.

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's a Roman that seeks the convenience of unknown.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't think it's a good idea to try it with a box of chopsticks.

249
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Home appliances are Roman.

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
After all, the sky bridge is a good thing.

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Roman?

252
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You don't understand?

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The efficiency is the dream of mankind.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Efficiency?

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The king and the kitchen equipment there are all convenient.

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But cleaning after cooking is too many units, it's super hard.

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm happy when I see it.

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That woman knows the weak points of home appliances.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But some people say that it's hard to stay safe and free without using fire.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There are many important situations such as a family with a young child.

261
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
A daily home appliance is a diversity.

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's a possibility.

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That diversity can sometimes give someone a glimpse of what they are.

264
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Romance is a possibility.

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Oh, that's the sky bridge, Muu.

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
After all, I can learn from the sky bridge at the base of Sakurako.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This guy.

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And you guys who are baking frankfurters while talking about long hair.

269
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't have the right to question you.

270
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What?

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that what a student's store is like?

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, that's right.

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's like a store that gives out a certificate to women who are very good at making money.

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But they pass it to someone else.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hey, tell me about the check-up in the school.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you know about the check-up in the school, why don't you check it properly?

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I did.

278
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
A member of the school who is very good at making money gave me a certificate.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What about the sales of the home appliances?

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you have the right to be a secretary?

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not just about showing off the display, it's not about selling it.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, no. The smell.

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What's this smell?

285
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What's that strong smell?

286
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Papa, I want to eat this.

287
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It smells good.

288
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, this is a sample.

289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Don't say that. Let me use the money.

290
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Papa, I want to eat it quickly.

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This child is serious.

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I can ask you to be relieved.

293
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Thanks to the vegetables of the Umeyashiki's home, the Humanity Research Institute was able to achieve the goal of sales.

294
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That girl again.

295
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll eat it. Thank you.

296
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Where is the Miscampus?

297
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I decided. I'll go to that girl.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I didn't want to go out because of the treasure.

299
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This way.

300
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Kagetsu.

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Where are you?

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a big problem.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But I was surprised that you were doing karate.

304
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Well, my parents told me that it was for your own good.

305
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But I wonder if it's okay for me to be Miscampus.

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know if it's Miscampus, but for me, Kagetsu is just a girl who is in trouble with the power.

307
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I see.

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I have to hide for a while.

309
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's over.

310
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's the first time I feel lonely after it's over.

311
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was enjoying the cultural festival.

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And everyone, Tsurumi, the director, Rokugo, and Samizu, we made a lot of friends at the university.

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And Moomoo and Dejimaru too.

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I had fun with Umeyashiki too.

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's coming up again.

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No.

317
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I know it from watching TV.

318
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In the human world, that's called love.

319
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's why it's different.

320
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't understand Moomoo.

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I can go see you.

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You did a great job, Umeyashiki.

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm sorry. I'm not Miscampus.

324
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Thanks to you, the target price is clear.

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, is that so?

326
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Umeyashiki is a cooking garden with a woman's skin.

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't think I'm being praised at all.
