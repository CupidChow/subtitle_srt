1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How lonely would you feel

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When the explosion of a pipe

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bursts out?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From the other side of the night sky

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I heard a gentle voice

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That suddenly appeared

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are the one

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That suddenly appeared

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You are the one

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That suddenly appeared

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You are the one

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That suddenly appeared

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You are the one

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That suddenly appeared

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There is no such thing as a natural

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's how it is

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Where are you going with a cat?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know what's right

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On your planet

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm probably living for you

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But it seems like a new job is exciting

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's get started

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Surumi-kun was also a new member of this club

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Both of them are in the literature club

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's nice that there are girls in the literature club

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Certainly, we only have males in the music club

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Girls like machine-tuning are valuable

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So welcome

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We are talking all the time

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's talk about something in the first year

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I have to talk about something

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What should I talk about?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well...

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ah, well...

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The other day...

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Stupid, stupid, stupid

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Surumi-kun doesn't remember me

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Talk...

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes, I have to connect the topic

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well...

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You like home appliances, don't you?

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, especially

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can't avoid it

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is this avoided?

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was hated?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, no, it's like this

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Um, Umeyashiki-san

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Actually, I'm not good at home appliances

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's a secret to the seniors

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They remembered my name

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And it's a secret between just the two of them

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just the two of them

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Huh?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Where is Mumu?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The End

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you going to do?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's my line, Maru

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you getting used to that kind of race?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Getting used to?

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's what you've been doing for a while now

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why are you asking me why I'm getting used to the family?

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mumu

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't intend to get used to them

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I'm saying something that will bring down the family

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dejimaru, you

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you impressed by the old-fashioned racists?

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No!

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How far have you been looking down?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Dejimaru is a fierce and aggressive form among the star class

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He hasn't stopped the earth from here

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How did the core class people get so strong?

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They didn't learn anything from what we've been doing

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why did Mumu's star fall?

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why did many of his friends become victims?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mumu and the others have to repeat the same mistake twice

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're saying that violence won't solve anything, you fool!

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You didn't tell me that!

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The face of a Buddha is three times bigger than the Earth!

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What do you mean?

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, Samezu-san, join our tennis club

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What should I do?

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I've been invited by other clubs too

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You!

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Eight-star class?

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is so gross

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If this goes on, the Earth will be damaged too

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Welcome, Maru!

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I wonder if something happened to Mumu

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You two, I'm going to go buy something

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll be right back, I'm counting on you, Rusu

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Just the two of us?

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What should we do?

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Umeyashiki-san, do you know anything about electricity?

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Um, I don't know much about it, but I'm interested

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then tell me

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, um, um, what are you saying?

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm an amateur too!

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've never done any repairs, so I came here

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What are you doing?

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you okay?

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's Akihiro!

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Akihiro!

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What!?

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No way!

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In such a dark place, with Akihiro?

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That woman!

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Akihiro, let's go home together

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, I'm being told to stay at the dorm, okay?

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Y-Yes

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This woman is pretending to be innocent

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How did she get Akihiro's heart?

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Um, I'm going to go look for the cat

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Watch me!

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're so persistent!

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey, Moomoo!

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's it!

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If Dejimaru doesn't have an exchange with the Earthlings

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Sakurako, let's go home!

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's with that building?

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A trap?

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey! Don't you dare get caught in a trap!

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
A trap that's stuck in a wall?

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No, Moomoo

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The thing that you got caught in a scary thing is...

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
an automatic door, Moomoo!

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
An automatic door?

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But why can't I open it even if Maru tries to get through?

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll tell you

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The infrared sensor hits the eye of the automatic door, Moomoo

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The light reflected from here is reflected on the floor

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and is reflected on the door again, Moomoo

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And when a person passes through, the amount of infrared changes

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and the door opens by itself, Moomoo

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So why doesn't it react to Maru?

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The reason is height, Moomoo

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When a fluffy thing like a floor is passing through

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
the sensor can't react

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And when there's a fluffy mat that's covered in sand

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it can't recognize the fluffiness

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You understood the mechanism and used it?

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Moomoo got caught in it the other day

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't say that, Moomoo

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Moomoo, you're a genius, Maru

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No!

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But if you have this much understanding, then why are you

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
trying to make an exchange with this unbearable human?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Huh?

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you observe the Earth, you'll see it for yourself, Maru

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who is the one who built the civilization and is currently ruling this planet?

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And who should learn science from?

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why are you making an exchange with the slaves who take care of cats?

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, I see

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I was wondering why it was a cat

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I was mistaken that the cat was the one who made the civilization of the Earth

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Moomoo, you were aware of it by mistake, but you didn't say anything

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But Moomoo understood technology from the exchange with the slaves

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you have the desire, you can learn it in any situation

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Compared to that, Maru

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's being held!

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Cute!

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why did you give it to it?

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is a Bazzlimos

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What a humiliation

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Stop it

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't take it

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't take it

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's going on?

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey, don't open it

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I haven't taken it yet

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Are you okay?

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why did you save me?

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I wanted to take more

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're a racist even though you were saved

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll pay you back

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're a slave girl

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hey, Akihiro

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go to the dark

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where were you?

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Huh?

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Um...

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Could it be that cat?

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, it's our cat

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I see

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The cat from the car door

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll take it

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The car door?

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That girl got stuck in the car door

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So...

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You saved her?

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I see. Thank you

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's wrong with this girl?

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How much do you play with Akihiro's heart?

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
For now, I'll try to build a good relationship with this man

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I hope you can repair it yourself from now on

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't do it by myself

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The End

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is...

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh no!

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sakurako is going to wake up!

204
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What?

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The main system of the rocket suddenly blacked out

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If we keep the main system and the main system off,

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the rocket will explode to keep it secret

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Tokyo is at the level where it disappears from the map

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What should we do?

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We should find a person who can solve this situation

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There's someone like that?

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's only one person

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We'll cross the Sky Bridge of the Human Reconstruction Research Society

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Wait! It's still 5 a.m.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Who is the Sky Bridge?

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The head of the circle?

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Som, I'm sure it's that man

218
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait, he's been coming to the university since this time

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There he is!

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why?

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And why is he standing on the railing?

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's the captain

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He's pretending not to notice

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sakurako, this is Yonaoshi

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh no, I don't understand

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's going to increase in the future, but I can't believe it's going to be so big

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's...

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a so-called illegal weapon

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What do you think, Roku? Can you use it?

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, I can't

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The liquid crystal is broken, and I can't recycle it

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You evil men, you've reached the mercy of the gods

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hello? Is your life safe?

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I saw a Buddha

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Then go to hell, you bastards!

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No, even the shits are a curse to you

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Well then, I've fulfilled the citizen's duty

238
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Huh? Umeyashiki-san? Why are you wearing pajamas?

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is...

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That...

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Roku, you can walk around in a girl's clothes

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please die once, sir

243
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This is the Humanity Reconstruction Research Society, which is making trouble every day

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is there a TV, washing machine, microwave, refrigerator that needs repair?

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't mind if it's unnecessary

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
As an exception, what I want to see is the basic thing to do in this circle is to repair the waste

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Since it's a student district, I wonder if they throw away the appliances that the graduates have not broken

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll send it to the nearby house while repairing

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No, it's a UFO, and it'll be found out

250
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Um, I want to see a little more activity

251
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Huh? In pajamas?

252
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Alright, then let's try this

253
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Um, well, well, well, I'm making trouble every day

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is the Humanity Reconstruction Research Society

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Is there a TV, washing machine, microwave, refrigerator that needs repair?

256
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Is there a TV, washing machine, microwave, refrigerator that needs repair?

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't mind if it's unnecessary

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want to see it repaired, sir

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sir?

260
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Huh?

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thanks to you, Umeyashiki, we were able to do it

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We're going to clean up and repair this waste, but would you like to see it?

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, you're so good at it, kitty

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Um, thank you

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What are you going to do if you say muu muu?

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, you can do whatever you want

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Repair this waste, sell it at a cultural festival, and make it a club activity fund

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
However, if you repair and disassemble the appliances yourself, it will be a major damage to the manufacturer's insurance, so please be aware that you are responsible for it

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There are various ways to repair and repair appliances, and do you know what is common to these appliances?

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Um

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That is, there are outlets

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Dryers and appliances with high frequency are often broken here

275
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:33,000
However, low frequency TV appliances are also broken when you step on them with furniture or keep adding tension in the corner

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Be careful

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So today, I will learn how to repair this poor connection outlet

278
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What? Me?

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The outlet is a little traumatized

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This dryer is a typical wire, and when you plug it into the outlet, the high-frequency connection has heat, and that's where the wire is

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Cut off a few centimeters from the hot wire

282
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Um, it's a little hard to cut the cord

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I should do it

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
OK, then divide the wires into two with a cutter

285
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The wires are one set with two

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If there is a third one, it is an earth wire

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Then I will peel the film at about 3 cm

288
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Look

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I will cut it

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There is a metal wire

291
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes, try one more

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I did it

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Next, use another plug you bought

294
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Open it with a screwdriver and remove the two screws inside

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, the screwdriver is attached to the screw

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
After screwing the tip of the wire firmly, wind it around the clock once on both screws

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Put the screw in the outlet and do the same for the other one

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Check that the wires are not touching each other

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Close the cover and it's done

300
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Is it done?

301
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, it looks good

302
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Turn on the power

303
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wow

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The dryer has changed

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Amazing

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I could fix it

308
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Did you fix it?

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Um

310
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's amazing

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But why are you wearing pajamas?

312
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What?

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Um

314
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Sakurako

315
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I know

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I know the cause of the broken part of the rocket

317
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What? You got the idea from the repair of the outlet?

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is the problem

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The outlet for the sink?

320
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I got the power from here

321
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So this is the broken part?

322
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The door seems to have been interfered by the cable that stretched to the rocket

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The cable was broken by the angle tension

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But why did you use such a far-off outlet?

325
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

326
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Of course

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I've used all the outlets in the house

328
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I didn't notice because the room was messy

329
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sakurako, Naotamu

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The problem of the Tokyo Dome has been solved

332
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I see

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's good

334
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's good

335
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

336
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

337
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

338
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

339
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

340
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

341
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

342
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

343
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

344
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

345
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

346
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

347
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

348
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

349
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

350
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

353
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

354
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

355
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

356
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

357
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

358
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

359
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

360
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

361
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The problem of the Dome has been solved

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Ah, I'll become a hedgehog

363
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,300
Autonomous door

364
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,500
vomit trap

365
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
Autonomous door that doesn't open until I shake it

366
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Is a trap, right?

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
cruciferous

368
