00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you for the food.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who are you going to?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Rice farmer.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Are you going to drink with us today?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then tomorrow?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What about the day after?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a little darker over there.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What looks?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What do you mean by looks?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can eat it with a pen-kubashi.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The one that adds pressure to the IH rice cooker is the IH rice cooker.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In addition, the steam IH formula and the vacuum IH formula.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mr. 6.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What was the line?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Robo line.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's a robot line.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Robo?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The End

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, is this...

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ego Station 4?

85
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wow!

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've never seen it before!

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not that big of a deal.

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a first-gen.

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've only seen it on the first and second versions of Ishikawa.

90
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's this, Mu?

91
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the latest game console.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Game console?

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's that super-shiny thing called a TV game.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's teaching the cat?

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But...

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'd rather not get too close to that Ego Station.

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because it's a cursed Ego Station.

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A cursed Ego Station?

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

100
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The story began

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
when a student got mad at a miserable event.

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That was the best.

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oops, I have to go back with a dash.

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey!

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey!

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh no, I'm swallowed up!

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is bad! This is too bad!

108
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Five minutes until the time of the rotation!

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I have to return to the hotel before that!

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
90% of my part-time job is done by students from the same university.

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
The L.O.V.D.

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
that I have to face when I return to the hotel.

113
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That means death.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That man is the last resort.

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Aaaaaaah!

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In the end, he couldn't make it in time,

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so he decided to pay his pension.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The man sold his ego-thrown because of his anger.

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And that's how the incident happened.

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Asule! Asule! As...

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What the...

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What the hell is this?!

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Who sold this?!

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The sadness of the student world.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The former owner of the ego-thrown, who was abandoned, was exposed in an instant.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hey, that guy.

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's stuck in a game console!

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Since then, his nickname has been Robosen.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Even though his campus life is filled with darkness...

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you doing with the machine?

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, I'm totally sorry.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I feel sorry for him.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He must want to forget about it.

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There's a machine on this Earth that controls people's fate.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
With this power, many large-scale riots have occurred.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're a fool to curse.

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Chief.

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Tsurumi.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's a initial rod.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's a slot loading type that can be called a dimension explosion.

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's inevitable that the media will be swallowed up.

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Um, initial rod?

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
An initial rod is a project order.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Development design.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Mock-up trial.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Dissolve.

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
After this process, the initial product is the initial rod.

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
However, the initial rod is said to be in poor condition.

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Why?

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We do various tests to prevent any problems.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The trial products made here are different from mass-produced products, and there are cases where they are carefully finished.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In a rough way,

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the robot anime's protagonist passes the trial test, and the mass-produced robot is a mob soldier.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Of course, the quality will drop and the bad condition will also appear.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's easy to understand.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
In the case of electronic devices, bugs will appear on the software side.

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, in order to write the update patch,

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
there are many memories on the screen.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you do if you can't connect to the Internet?

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There is a hidden SD slot inside.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When you return to the service center, you can use it.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, this is the first-generation trial's bestseller, Romanda.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, let's get back to the story.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Egosute's slot loading.

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is a time bomb.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
To insert the media and pull it in,

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm turning the roller of the rubber belt.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This rubber is 100% broken by the damage of the old one.

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a trouble jewel box.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The identity of that white-hued liquid is

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the grease on the missing gear.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's the true identity of the curse.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, this Egosute is already...

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It was supposed to be.

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The power is on its own now.

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This guy's problem wasn't just one.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's the curse after all.

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's why it's his turn.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Tsurumi.

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is a new product of the initial model.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
New product?

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It was sold, but it wasn't used by consumers.

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't worry. It's working normally.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are two more curse machines!

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You've been looking for it on purpose.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is to expose the identity of the thing called curse.

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Um, what are you looking for?

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a comparison of the Egosute that works normally

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and the Egosute of curse.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It looks tough.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's tough.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We have to do everything one by one.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There are some parts that are hand-replaced

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in the initial rot circuit board.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've been soldering and fixing it with a wire later.

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This wire is called a jumper.

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's one of my reasons to check this jumper wire, but...

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This board isn't broken.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So it's around this power supply.

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If the power was discharged and the power was on its own...

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Damn it!

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not a design mistake!

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can only clean and close it again.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's crying.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wow! It's like a hospital drama!

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Kadenya!

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, you're going to the Egosute again?

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not tired of it.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The curse was told to me by Mimitako,

212
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so there's no robot ship around here.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right, Roku-go?

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm a meat ship, as you can see.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm a muscle ship, too.

216
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm a ship, too.

217
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm a ship, too.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, I'm not!

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, I see.

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Boss, there's a screw left.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I told you it's fine.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You didn't have to prove that the Egosute was strange.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is a memory.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Look! It's working properly, so it's fine!

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a memory of me and this guy!

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I see.

227
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Boss, for Roku-go, the curse Egosute...

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's wrong, Sakurako?

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's all play together.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Friends are nice.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're always making fun of me!

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Aren't you embarrassed?

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Shut up!

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Shut up!

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're the one who should be ashamed!

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Friendship destruction game.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a machine of curse, after all.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry!

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm just a local, but I'm not good at dating.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I know. I know.

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I haven't even registered.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
After all, Tokyo is like a small town of local people.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wow, you're so understanding!

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are various local people mixed in.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like a small town?

246
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's a dangerous day tomorrow.

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What's that? A smartwatch?

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's useful. It tells you the date of the flood.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Wow, does it have a thermometer?

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It does, but what are you going to do with your wrist?

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it bad?

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The temperature is close to the center of the body.

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's the temperature of the part with the least temperature change.

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The temperature that can be measured while this temperature is reflected is the armpit or the inside of the body.

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The wrist is too influenced by the outside air.

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's the right temperature to close the armpit and measure it after it's warm enough.

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's bad.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And...

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Shut up.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't care about Akihiro.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Samezu.

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What's wrong?

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm going.

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You forgot something.

265
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I forgot.

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is the worst.

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll go buy it.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This woman is always entangled in the cherry blossoms.

270
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to drink it.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That exposed, battlefield-like appearance must be the wife of a slave.

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mumu, don't listen to the words of a slave's wife.

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your head is going to be pregnant.

274
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But I don't think it's okay to act like a cat in front of a human.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's okay, Maru.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So cute.

277
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So cute.

278
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That cat is the one who was with Hokurikuonna, right?

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The one next to her is...

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Is the cat on the train that was on the news last week Akihiro's cat?

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This...

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This means...

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It means that they measure the basic temperature in the dark.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What is the normal temperature?

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The normal temperature is the normal temperature.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How annoying!

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want to measure the temperature even if I have to buy a cat.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That Hokurikuonna!

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey, leave that woman alone, Maru.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
She's already dead.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We need the help of the Earthlings to overcome this situation, Muu.

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But our existence...

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We don't have time to choose a method, Muu!

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What? What?

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, give me back my skirt!

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You idiot cat!

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The End

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What is this dark room?

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That Hokurikuonna...

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Is she already dead?

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's cold...

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm using my experience to use the basic temperature to the maximum.

303
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But my fever doesn't go down at all, Muu.

304
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Ouch!

305
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You idiot!

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What's wrong with you? Are you trying to die?

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You were dumped by a man!

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's warm...

309
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll leave the bath towel here.

310
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not too bad for a man who was dumped by a man.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That guy...

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's got a big chest.

313
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Whatever.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Muu...

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Um...

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're Samezu, right?

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey!

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You need to dry your hair or you'll get a fever!

319
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes.

320
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Here, measure your fever.

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why do you measure your fever with a thermometer?

323
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You don't know that?

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Huh?

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Even a country girl knows the water level, right?

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Water and metal are easy to transmit heat.

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,820
The water that was warmed up by the body temperature and then

328
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:14,000
expanded into the capillary, and then measured with a scale.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The water was at a constant temperature expansion, so it was easy to treat as a measure of body temperature.

330
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But...

331
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It seems that this thermometer can be measured immediately.

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The electronic thermometer is displayed by dividing the body temperature in 10 minutes

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
based on the results of the first few tens of seconds of temperature check.

334
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can also measure it by leaving it as it is.

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is popular now is the non-contact infrared thermometer.

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
If it is a hot object, it is a type that detects infrared radiation.

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
When you get closer to each other, you feel the heat, right?

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That is infrared.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It can only detect the surface of the body.

340
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
In an environment that is affected by the outside world, the personality will be affected.

341
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
...

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
...

343
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What? This is common sense.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Samesu-san, in the literature...

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Enough! Hurry up and eat!

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
...

347
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
...

348
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I-Itadakimasu.

349
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is really delicious! The ginger goes really well with it.

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If it's a Ninobe ginger, it's even more delicious.

351
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Ninobe?

352
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
...

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
H-Hurry up and fix it! My English is terrible!

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Do it, okay?

355
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Ah, Samesu-san!

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What is it?

357
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Um... Samesu-san is...

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
...heat.

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
...

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What?

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I always... um...

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
...I don't think of him as someone who does this because he's strong.

363
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry for making him decide on his own.

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Samesu, you know, you have a dog, right?

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I mean, you have a dog.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Then I'll have a three-channel dog.

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
No-chan, forget it. This is what a country bumpkin is.

368
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You think so too, Tsurumi.

369
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This guy too...

370
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No way...

371
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
...

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
...

373
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
...

374
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
...

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
...

376
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
...

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
...

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
...

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
...

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
...

381
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
...

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
...

383
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
...

384
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
...

385
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
...

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
...

387
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
...

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
...

389
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
...

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
...

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
...

392
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
See you later!

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, thanks. See you at the university.

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What the...

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What the hell is this?

396
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm a woman from the Northland, and yet...

397
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm not going to make you remember anything weird!

398
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm not going to be Akihiro...

399
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thank you for saving the girl from Sakurako.

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
There she is!

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Sorry!

402
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I was looking for her and was in a rush.

403
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm sorry for saying such harsh things.

404
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What are you talking about?

405
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Akihiro and I are friends, right?

406
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Anyway, what are you going to do now?

407
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Where are you going?

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
To a dark place?

409
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Come to think of it...

410
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why is the rocket going off?

411
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, whatever!

412
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Akihiro, there's a dark place over there...

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No...

414
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I guess I have to keep this order.

415
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Sorry, I'm going home today.

416
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm really sorry.

417
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yatsumaru is busy.

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, so Ni-no-bu is Ni-sha.

419
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm glad you're all right.

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't need your help.

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
After this...

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mu was...

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
...injured.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He was abused.

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm trying to find out what's going on.

426
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The moon fell on the back of the road.

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The dog's eyeball is square.

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The giant human was the first to arrive at the planet.

429
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The day when it became a Pterodactyl

430
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
was approaching.

431
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The day when it became a Pterodactyl

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
was approaching.

433
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The day when it became a Pterodactyl

434
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
was approaching.

435
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm going to be a monkey.

436
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm going to be a monkey.

437
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Thank you for your care, Ms. Samesu.

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I did that for your goodwill.

439
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I didn't mean to...

440
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Your face is still a little red.

441
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm not feeling well.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Wait, I'll get you some cold medicine.

443
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You're a good guy.
