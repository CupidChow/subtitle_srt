1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
The Cat's

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,940
I did it! I got it!

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,840
I found a new cat!

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,320
Huh? Why can't I catch it?

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,920
Sakurako, what are you doing?

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Ah, I was just mumbling.

7
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,940
Cat, it neveræ™´ with you

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,440
Like a small dot mill in pearls

9
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,820
Dr sinkish into dizziness

10
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,280
Water overs flow

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
The End

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Sakurako, you've been so into that lately.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,960
Cat bread quest.

14
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,440
In other words, cat food.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,040
It's a really popular game right now.

16
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Look!

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,000
It's a game where you use your smartphone's GPS

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,760
to find and get a cat.

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
If you move it around with your camera like this...

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Hey, there's something in there!

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,960
After you find it, you can battle it with a cat punch and catch it.

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,400
It's like a cat is really there.

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
That's the amazing thing about AR, the expansion reality.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
Expansion reality?

25
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,320
In the real world, characters and content made with CG appear

26
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,640
and expand the reality.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,040
What's the difference between VR, which is popular these days?

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,560
VR is based on virtual space,

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,080
and it feels like it's in a game.

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,560
AR is like the world of the game overflows in the real world.

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,520
If you expand the reality through your glasses,

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,680
you can translate the pose automatically when you go abroad,

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,600
or you can use route guides.

34
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,040
It's said that it makes your life more convenient.

35
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,240
I see.

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,680
So that's the expansion reality.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,240
There's an event today!

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
An event?

39
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,440
A strong boss cat will appear in the park.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,120
You can defeat it with the help of multiple players.

41
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
The boss is about to start!

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Let's go!

43
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
There's no one here.

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
I'm the first?

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,840
There's no doubt about it.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
I think so.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,160
Anamori!

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,320
Anamori, you want to eat a cat?

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,400
Well...

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,200
Idiot! You'll be found!

51
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,720
You're always in a place you can't find.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,520
This is also part of the security operation.

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,880
You're making excuses.

54
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,280
But there are only two of them.

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,680
I can't defeat the boss cat if there are only two of them.

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,200
Oh, you were also doing cat hunting?

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,200
Samezu!

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
Hey, who's that handsome guy who looks like an elite?

59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm Anamori, the son of Sakurako's father's friend.

60
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
I-I see!

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,720
Hm...

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,480
Whatever it is, don't pull my leg.

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,680
Are you used to it, Samezu?

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,200
Of course.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,600
I've been using my phone for ten times to do this.

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,040
Ten times?!

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,120
Could it be that the player's name is Samezu Usugura?

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,840
Y-Yes, but...

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
Friend?

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,920
In this game, you can request a friend from a player nearby in the GPS.

71
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,320
You can cooperate and play, or give a cat you get as a gift.

72
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,600
A player nearby?

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,360
Huh?

74
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Y-You could be...

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Cherry.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,160
You're the legendary player, Cherry?!

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Is Sakurako that amazing?

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,760
You're kidding!

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,400
The cat ranking you got is the best player in this area!

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,200
And you're the one who's Cherry!

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,120
Sakurako, you're such a heavy user.

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,960
Why would I be Cherry?

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
Sakura is...

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Cherry Blossom, so...

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Huh?!

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,560
I was expecting a cute Cherry Boy and Akihiro.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,760
How's Cherry?

88
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,920
He's saying such a terrible thing.

89
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Isn't that a plum house?

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,360
Huh?

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Chief, Number 6, and Tsurumi!

92
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Hey!

93
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
They're here!

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
So you're all cat friends.

95
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,120
They're so bored.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,160
We're so surprised.

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Tsurumi's here too.

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,840
I have to do my best.

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,720
Chief! Miss Canvas is smiling!

100
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
What?!

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,160
Could it be you?

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
Another Sky Bridge?

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,760
W-What's going on?!

104
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,040
I knew it.

105
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,160
The mysterious player Babel who sends me cats every day...

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,880
You're so mean.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,360
Are you a stalker?

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,600
I don't know!

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
I don't know!

110
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,160
What's he doing here?

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
There are more and more people.

112
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
As Sakurako said, it's a trend.

113
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh!

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
A cat is here!

115
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,600
The event is about to start!

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll catch you with my little hands!

117
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Oh!

118
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,480
So that's Ms. Usugura who uses the 10 accounts!

119
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
Keep up with her!

120
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,160
Let's go!

121
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,320
I didn't hear anything.

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,960
The event requires your cooperation.

123
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,480
Tsurumi, there's an item you need to catch, so please get it.

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
O-Okay.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,200
Sonoko, Ms. Usugura!

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,680
Please throw the matatabi and calm down your anger.

127
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,280
Y-Yes!

128
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,240
Don't order me around!

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,680
I made a mistake.

130
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
What's that girl doing?

131
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
Is she the legendary player, Cherry?

132
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,360
Amazing!

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
Everyone!

134
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,560
Please chase after the item with Cat Punch's Renda!

135
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,920
O-Okay!

136
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Let's go, everyone!

137
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,160
There's a well on the bridge!

138
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
Don't move!

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,520
Now!

140
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Catch the item!

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Start!

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
I caught it!

143
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a success!

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,880
This is Sakurako!

145
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Oh, no.

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,080
The legendary player, Cherry, is so strong!

147
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
You did it.

148
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,840
That was amazing.

149
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Since that day, Sakurako has been getting into the cat's den more and more.

150
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,320
She walks around with her portable power to charge her smartphone every day.

151
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,040
If you put that in, there's no room for the moon to enter!

152
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Just for now.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
Just for now.

154
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm going.

155
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,960
She wakes up in the morning and goes out.

156
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960
She only has to put on the number of accounts for her external devices.

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
Oh, it's Cherry!

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,640
You've improved again!

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,440
Teach us some tips!

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Oh, right!

161
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Um...

162
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,880
For Sakurako, who grew up in the countryside, has a low self-esteem and is a commisioner,

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,440
this world of expansion reality is too beautiful.

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Cherry's smartphone cover is so cute!

165
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
You're right!

166
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,920
The cat is cute, too!

167
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Cherry's cute, too!

168
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,000
There was nothing but a moon.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm going to dig a hole!

170
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,360
There's a good scoop here!

171
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,320
With that good scoop, I'm going to dig a hole more efficiently!

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,520
I'm going to find a better scoop!

173
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,520
My cat is cute from any angle.

174
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, Momo's here.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to find a good scoop.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, Momo's here.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Where were you?

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, I've been into games lately, so...

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A new cat has appeared!

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I knew it!

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sakurako!

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sakurako!

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, Momo, you're in the way!

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I did it!

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Look, Momo!

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a very rare cat!

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey, go away!

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There are so many cats lately.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm in trouble for being treated like garbage.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I heard that the cat bread game is popular.

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you mean?

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because everyone is playing games,

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
there are fewer people feeding cats.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's why cats are being wild.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I see.

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In the portable power supply,

197
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,460
you can also take the pet's

198
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,000
step when you're in trouble.

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are many children who are weak in the cold,

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
so this is for Moomoo.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's really warm.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Moomoo...

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's no place for Moomoo in here!

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I...

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I did something terrible to Moomoo!

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Moomoo, you're in the way!

207
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I...

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I...

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Moomoo!

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm back, Moomoo!

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm back!

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Sakurako, I'm sorry!

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry, Moomoo.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry, Moomoo.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
From now on, don't play games.

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll face Moomoo properly.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sakurako...

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Moomoo...

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This cat stinks!

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, no, no, no, no, Moomoo!

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Moomoo, it feels good to take a bath today!

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, Moomoo, I'll never take a bath!

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Moomoo hasn't taken a bath in a long time.

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's why it stinks.

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If the bath is not good,

226
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I should wash it once.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey, Moomoo.

228
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can you put down the back fastener?

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to wash it.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you.

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Moomoo, do you want to wash it together?

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

233
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What is it?

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The smell is getting stronger day by day.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And it seems that it goes somewhere every day.

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where is it going?

237
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I tried to attach a GPS to Moomoo.

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What is this?

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The range of action is very...

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know, so I secretly attached an action camera to Moomoo's head.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Moomoo, I'm sorry.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The action camera is small, sturdy,

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and the director said that it can take a dynamic image

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
by strong stabilization.

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What was it?

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Huh?

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The battery is out?

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Listen, Umuyasuki.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The action camera consumes a lot of battery.

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It is not suitable for long-term use.

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So I tried to install an attached battery.

252
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hmm...

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Did you notice?

254
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Wow, it's coming off.

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Wow.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It goes through such a place.

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I feel like a cat.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's moving quite hard, but the screen doesn't shake.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, by the way...

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This action camera has a digital stabilization function.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It takes a large image, shifts only the shaking part, and cuts through.

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a very simple stabilization function.

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I got a chowchew from a stranger.

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, it's Michelangelo.

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's called by another name.

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, don't eat it!

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's completely related to a local cat.

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It disappeared!

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Huh? A shark?

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tsumikun?

271
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Anyway, Mom, what a fight.

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What a beautiful cat.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What? What's this shaking?

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The screen is shaking beyond the stabilization limit.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wait.

276
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Mom, could it be that this cat is in love with...

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What are you looking at?

278
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Nothing.

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I see.

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mom, I don't want to lose weight to keep my body in shape.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't see well.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's right!

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The feature of the action camera is that it is small but has a 4K resolution.

284
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's right.

285
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
With wide angle view and high frame rate, you can clearly record details.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Huh?

287
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This way!

288
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It smells bad.

289
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh, no.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's completely clean now.

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
The civilization's Mu-Mu doesn't mark with a

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
large number of things.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Mu-Mu, we have a feast tonight.

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's buy a lot of Churu and go home.

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I didn't expect Mu-Mu to not react to Churu.

296
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I was so shocked.

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What is it?

298
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Are there more cats around here?

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's why cats are being wild.

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not interested.

301
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mu-Mu, wait!

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Mu-Mu, I mean...

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That cat...

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Huh? It's injured.

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What is this?

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I've heard that among the male cats that were born in the first period,

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
there are female cats, children, and young children.

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They are born again instinctively by losing their children.

309
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's go.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mu-Mu is not interested in the primitive fight between the two.

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, wait!

312
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh!

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You, living animals, listen up!

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't come any closer to this wild animal.

315
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, don't come any closer, Mu.

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even if Mu is serious about fighting the living animals...

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mu...

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's just a matter of time before the investigation.

319
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's play, Mu.

320
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll raise it without hesitation.

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Mu was born and raised in a faraway space.

322
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
His name is Mu.

323
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
His name is Mu.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He is called the next-born Mu-Mu.

325
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Wait, Mu-Mu!

326
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that Sakura?

327
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a cherry blossom.

328
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Hey, where are you going?

329
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm going to the place where the wind blows and the trees blow.

330
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sakura, I left that white cat to you.

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No way! You know that, don't you?

332
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That white cat must be talking about Mu-Mu.

333
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Mu is a cat living in space on that day.

334
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
A cat on the earth can't be happy.

335
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Besides, the moon is calling at dusk.

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Mu is really stupid.

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's all I can say.

338
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Sakura, be happy, Mu.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Good luck.

340
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mu...

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The Next Day

342
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We're separated

343
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Even if we meet sometimes, it's no use

344
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want to be with you

345
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Anyway, I don't have enough time

346
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's go somewhere where there are no people

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If I get a break

348
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a wonderful day

349
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Overflowing power

350
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I throw everything away and I'm alive

351
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Because you forget me

352
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
By that time, I can meet you right away

353
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I wonder if I should sell it
