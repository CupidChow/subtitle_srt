1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
This video is a work of fiction.

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,700
It's finally over.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,700
It's been a while since my last day off 293.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I fell for the cat bun quest, and I ended up buying all the equipment without thinking about the future.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you, Nico Nico.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sorry. I can't give you any extra money for your personal hobbies.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're right.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ah, I'm so self-sufficient.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Damn it!

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Damn it!

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What the hell is this?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That woman is getting out of her mind again!

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Damn it!

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Cute.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh no.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The butterfly is spinning.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come here. Come here.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Come here.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why is the cat running away?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
God, please help me!

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is it?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Occhi-mon.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What's going on with this person?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I want to see you.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want to see you.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't take you away from me.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can't take you away from me.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to see you.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want to see you.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to see you.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to see you.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I want to see you.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to see you.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to see you.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to see you.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to see you.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
To be continued...

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Which room is this?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No way.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can hear the purring sound from the next room.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Excuse me.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What a dirty room.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The room is clean.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's my mom.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tell her I'm coming.

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My head hurts.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Water.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Water.

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm out of energy.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was looking forward to cooking.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have to use it.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm using it all day.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was thinking of making lunch every day when I bought the refrigerator.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have to go to work.

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Who is it?

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mom?

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I brought you something that is not for sale.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What?

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Excuse me.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Who is it?

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you a cat in the park?

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What is this?

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What does this mean?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I was drunk in the park.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did you bring me home?

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I have to clean the house.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I saw the kitchen and it was full of seasonings.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I like cooking.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I finished setting up the refrigerator.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're early.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're going somewhere?

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We're going home.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait.

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You said you were going to buy this.

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wait.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's okay.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I started my own circle.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Risu?

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's popular these days.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Home rental.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When I rent a room for a time, I rent a room for a time.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I rent a room for a time instead of a room for repair.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I rent a room for a time that is expensive but I want to use it.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It depends on the person, but I rent it for a month at a price of 1 in 10.

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you use my circle, you can get a good price.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Business?

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have to use it in real life.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There are many drawbacks.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There are also things that you don't know until you buy it.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
For example, the refrigerator.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The current refrigerator is based on the shape that was released in 1960.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The structure hasn't changed.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This system is the same now and then.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This is the refrigerator with Mitsubishi Electric that recently changed its full model.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't think it's much different from what I used.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is there a good thing you don't know until you use it?

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right.

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The exterior is the same.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The thickness of the wall of this refrigerator is thinner.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you mean?

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The width and depth are the same.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The storage capacity in the house increases.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Compared to the previous models, there is about one shopping basket.

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This refrigerator has a good insulation and a thin layer of urethane.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The water tank used for automatic water supply is also used in the refrigerator.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This makes it possible to use the refrigerator.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It is a replacement for the time.

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The old house has changed its way of using it.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's make lunch and see how it works.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What is this?

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A construction site?

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I did it.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You did it.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can handle the task of using the rest of the stuff.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can do it.

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The room is bigger when there is room in the refrigerator.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can make a side dish.

120
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There is room in the refrigerator.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's fill the house with beer.

122
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I see.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was naturally scheduled.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
By the way, the refrigerator was in poor condition, so I started drinking in the park.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's a physical change.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I will buy it.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Thank you.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
By the way, this dryer is also a good idea.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The hair dries quickly and the bath is easy to use.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will buy it.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There is also an IH rice cooker that cooks rice very well.

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will buy it.

133
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's been a long time, Nozomi.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's her.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Kagetsu Senpai?

137
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then, what is Kitashinagawa?

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The emergency university connection.

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Is it also Sakurako?

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Senpai, I was worried.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't get in touch with her since I graduated.

142
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I heard rumors that she was drunk in the park and was rolling in the hole.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Nozomi, who everyone admired, wouldn't do that.

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No way.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you for buying.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Nozomi.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What's wrong with your face?

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What?

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a light.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What's wrong? Did you find a satellite that is not a nationality?

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's far above the international station.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's this?

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The hamburger sauce spilled.

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh no. Don't be scared.

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you really okay, Mom?

156
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well, don't worry.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I just got rid of their mood with this examination.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's bad enough to lose this earth.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But, the majority of the LEDs in the last time were replaced by the earth.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, the emergency team came to solve this problem.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So, if we can escort them well, we can save the earth.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm counting on you, Sakurako.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll do my best.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Will you do something?

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What? We're backing up?

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't be careless.

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Our opponent is achenobias, people call brain cells.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Go- Yetaker!

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Those who come to the army continue to digest pig muradors like the former.

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
they always contend against the indigenous people and work they by themselves.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Their tribe has never used 8th grade students.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,720
To our rumors about the ancestors who started this process,

173
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,240
we believe we can turn our head to other tribes because of them.

174
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,140
He claims he wants to protect that dashing dominated by giants.

175
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,240
We can easily scold the tribes and feed them with our own flesh.

176
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,320
The Dashing...

177
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:41,760
That carnival bee's

178
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,760
We don't have the concept of preserving food.

179
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,760
It's just as he wants a refrigerator.

180
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
All right, Sakurako.

181
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Let's go ahead and press the button Tenkuubashi gave us.

182
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes!

183
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
I-It's all right.

184
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
I've learned the knowledge I've learned to present to Mr. Kitashinagawa.

185
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Now, here...

186
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
What is disloyalty?

187
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,760
It's a phenomenon in which food ingredients transform by the action of a microorganism.

188
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,760
As the situation progresses, the deterioration of taste,

189
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
the degeneration, and harmful substances occur.

190
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
However!

191
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,760
In the temperature of the sky, in order to force the work of microorganisms,

192
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,760
refrigerators are very effective against disloyalty.

193
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
As expected of Professor Tenkuubashi.

194
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Your Excellency is satisfied.

195
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Good job, Sakurako.

196
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
The opponent is getting on board.

197
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Let's cut the cards a little stronger.

198
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
Yes!

199
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
O-Okay, then.

200
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Let's take a look at the performance of each refrigerator.

201
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,760
That Mike?

202
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Yes.

203
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
That Tsugiha-Gi Mumu.

204
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,760
So the rumor was true.

205
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,760
From that fierce battle against the scientist who was the subject of the destruction of the enemy,

206
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Tsugiha-Gi Mumu was said to have survived until the death of the scientist's wife.

207
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,760
It is said that you were the one who broke the father's legs,

208
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
but it seems that you had a flying fin.

209
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Do you want to try it?

210
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Genia!

211
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Your Excellency is calling you.

212
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
You've saved your life.

213
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Hey.

214
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
What?

215
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
That's where you're standing.

216
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
What?

217
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,760
The border between Tokyo and Kanagawa.

218
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
This is Mamemu.

219
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
What?

220
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
What?

221
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
What is it, Father?

222
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
Look at this. It's amazing.

223
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
What?

224
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,760
The refrigerator on Earth can keep the freshness of about 10 days.

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
Impossible!

226
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,760
The meat should be delicious and fresh with the soul that has fallen out.

227
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Why does it last 10 days?

228
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,760
That's because there is something called acid in the food's liquid.

229
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
Acid?

230
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Acid is the reaction of oxygen in the air that merges with food.

231
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
It is an easy example to understand with food.

232
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
It is the one that the peeled apples are transformed.

233
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Acid transforms the quality and flavor of food.

234
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
I'll kill you all.

235
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,760
If oxygen reacts, it is perfect if it is stored in space.

236
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,760
There was a refrigerator where the vacuum chiller was implemented,

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:47,760
but it seems that the water of the meat was soaked and the umami was broken down when stored at low temperature.

238
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
What is this?

239
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
How do you keep acid in the food?

240
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Basically, it is stored at a low temperature called a chiller.

241
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,760
If the original chiller is 0 degrees, it is stored at a temperature of minus 3 degrees.

242
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,760
It freezes the surface of the food and prevents acidification.

243
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
It's a refrigerator?

244
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I can eat this meat even if it's frozen.

245
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Here, your hand, Sakurako.

246
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,760
As expected of the emperor.

247
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,760
You are very good at noticing.

248
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,760
The refrigerator is frozen and the teeth are passed through, so you can cook without using a freezer.

249
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,760
The taste is also fresh.

250
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Dad, I like this.

251
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Alright, let's buy it to my wife and relatives.

252
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
And to my lover.

253
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Good reaction.

254
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
This is the salt field.

255
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Let's start the tatami, Sakurako.

256
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
Yes.

257
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,760
Take vegetables and be healthy.

258
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,760
It produces carbon dioxide and protects the freshness so that vegetables can sleep.

259
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Don't talk about vegetables.

260
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Yes.

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
The delicious Nagamochi has the best texture.

262
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,760
If it's meat, how about a quick freezer?

263
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
There are still more.

264
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
It's a long way.

265
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Send it to the ship.

266
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
I really like the planet Earth.

267
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
This is...

268
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I can't believe it.

269
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Maybe...

270
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Yes, the ship is ready to take off.

271
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
The first day of the trip.

272
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,760
It is a wild tiger that has been living in the world for 100,000 years.

273
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,760
Even now, which is said to be in a state of decline after 3000 years, the living environment is still being destroyed.

274
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,760
The bones that are said to be used for fur and medicine are also traded in the public.

275
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,760
The secret is not left behind.

276
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,760
The research team is conducting a report on the secret of the wild animals.

277
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
What are these monkeys?

278
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,760
They are a slave and are against the Alsthal Cat's hair.

279
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
If you look closely, you can see the pictures of the slaves.

280
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,760
I see. This is the resistance of the slaves.

281
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,760
You bastard, Moo Moo.

282
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,760
You're a cruel guy. Is that what you mean, Moo Moo?

283
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Is that what you call a stone's return?

284
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,520
The

285
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
The research scientists the committee chose for the Japanese навигatie.

286
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Moo got exploded or what was that Mu-ム?

287
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Don't do it with us Muu.

288
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
IOk..

289
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,760
It was a dangerous place.

290
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Don't think you can handle it with us again!

291
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
You will all die!

292
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
You fiends!

293
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Earthlings!!!

294
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
The End

295
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Don't worry. We're here for you.

297
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,760
Let's do our best next time.

298
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
It's a shame.

299
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,760
If things went well, we'd get a reward from the government.

300
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Then it's fine.

301
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
We got a magic ring from the shop that sold it to that big guy.

302
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
I brought Sakurako.

303
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,760
She tried something good, so it's not a bad thing.

304
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Tokyo is a scary city.

305
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
Sakurako.

306
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
It's a picnic.

307
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Let's eat lunch together.

308
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Yes.

309
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
That guy...

310
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Nozomi.

311
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I have something to tell you.

312
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,760
I have a question.

313
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
He's a strange guy.

314
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
He's not honest.

315
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,760
He's clumsy, but he's a good boy.

316
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
I see.

317
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Hey, Mumu.

318
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Science and electronics make people's lives better.

319
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Sakurako is trying to end it with a good story.

320
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,760
The End

321
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,760
I want to be with you

322
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,760
Anyway, I don't have enough time

323
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Let's go somewhere where there's no one

324
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,760
If I could have a break

325
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I'm full of the power of wonderful days

326
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,760
I throw everything away and I'm alive

327
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Because you forget me

328
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,760
By then I can see you right away

329
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I'm full of the power of wonderful days

330
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
This is the latest refrigerator.

331
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,760
It's amazing, but it's expensive.

332
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
The price is this.

333
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
It's cheap.

334
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
But Sakurako, make it cheaper.

335
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Yes, I'll make it half price.

336
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
No, no, no.

337
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
It's amazing.
