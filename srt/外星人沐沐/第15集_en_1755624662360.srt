1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Summer.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A heat wave with high temperatures.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A school building in the sixth grade.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A stylish glass-bore building.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's inside?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Um, teacher...

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Please lower the temperature.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A blood vessel!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'mvofore behavioural detecting.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,380
Brother Valasia, Angel Xuan, the

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,000
person who handicrafts welding.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,400
The student in charge of the

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,400
Question Overdose initiative.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,640
The humus reportmaber.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,000
Vaccine.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The uniform on the black shirt.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,720
And recently.

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,720
I know that

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
Ah ah

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Inside you

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I want to say

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
My heart

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Hold me tighter

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm glad I was happy

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm just going to live with a lie

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,720
I'm happy that I'm normal

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
I'm not enough yet

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Inside your heart

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
I want to say

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I can't take you away from me

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Inside your heart

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Inside your eyes

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Like a teardrop

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,720
I want to burst and dance

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm going to that summer day

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,720
The world is in a pinch right now

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
We have to do something about it

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
It's SDGs

39
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Miura, you're crazy since you were born

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
I'm going to die

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,720
In the future, the day when the two or three-carbon carbon will be a serious crime will come

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
So for the sake of the future

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Die

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
It's terrible

45
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Terrible

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Too terrible

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Help me

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,720
The university is going to be a power outage

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Miura's bastard is a nob

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
If it's not a good thing to be in class

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
It's a plan to make us stay in the school and take the money

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
It's okay to take the title in other classes

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
The seat of the university is the easiest

54
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Is the air conditioner in the university managed somewhere?

55
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
It depends on the company

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
It's common to drive a huge outdoor air conditioner in each classroom

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,720
And the remote control in each classroom is only allowed to be operated for a part

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,720
It is concentrated in the management room

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
I sneaked in there before and let the management get away

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,720
I was lowering the temperature and found out that I could never enter the management room again

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
Idiot

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Then what about that?

63
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
That?

64
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I told you

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,720
The cooler has a start switch for the company to check the operation later

66
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah, that was

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I was in a good mood and started it and it was filled with a hole

68
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
You guys

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Well, I understood the general situation

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
Self-proclaimed

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Don't involve me

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
I can't keep an eye on the university anymore

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Don't say that

74
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
You've always fought the university

75
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I finally understood what you said

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
The university's glory

77
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,720
They're all the ones who are calm

78
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
I only think of us who are in the general school as money

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,720
I thought it was a support group for the sports club

80
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
The club is the same

81
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,720
I'm using the special force

82
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
That's right

83
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Tenku Bashi, you've always fought such an unreasonable

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
As expected

85
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Help me, Tenku Bashi

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Please

87
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Your Excellency

88
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
As expected of Professor Tenku Bashi

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
He's grasping the hearts of the people

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,720
He's usually treated like a stranger

91
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,720
Amazing

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Well, I understand your feelings

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Rebellion is a weak point that is easy to understand

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Raise the spear and take justice

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Yeah

96
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm fighting

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Hey, hey, hey

98
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Anyway

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Because the chief is usually pulling the university's electricity

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
The university side is saving money

101
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Who is the real enemy?

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Oh, the battle with the Taisen side

103
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Kill, kill

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Kill the evil scientists who are against the current government

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
I'll take care of the Taisen side

106
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I'll blow them up who are all talking about violence

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
You're fine

108
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
That's right

109
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,720
I have to do something about the main body's thermistor

110
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Thermistor?

111
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Thermistor is a temperature sensor used in a wide variety of appliances

112
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Temperature sensor?

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Did you just say that?

114
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,720
What's the temperature sensor?

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
There's a sensor that uses metal

116
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
It's easy to understand the thermistor used in the old kata

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Metal has a high thermal conductivity

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,720
The thermistor used in the air conditioner also emits current into the metal that changes resistance at temperature

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,720
It's a device that judges the room temperature by its size

120
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
There are things that rise and fall in resistance at a temperature

121
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
I see

122
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Then if you replace the thermistor with a metal with little resistance

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
You don't have to do that

124
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
It's a sensor

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,720
You can judge the room temperature by its size

126
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Go back to the sensor

127
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm checking the air temperature of the air conditioner and how much it cools down

128
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
There's a sensor around here

129
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Let's do it

130
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I did it!

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
It's cool!

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
It's cold

133
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Hello?

134
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Please raise the temperature

135
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
I gave up on the air conditioner

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Do you have any coolant?

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
It's a cooling fan

138
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
It's a coolant that can carry coolness using heat

139
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
It's a moist cooling fan that can't be dried

140
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
The humidity is...

141
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Is this Amazon?

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Close the fan quickly!

143
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
What the hell is that?

144
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,720
That's a fan that can be dried like a fengen

145
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Then don't choose the conditions

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
How about a spot cooler?

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,720
It's a cooler that can move by uniting the air conditioner's indoor and outdoor air

148
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
It's so cool

149
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
It's a heat resistance test!

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Is it okay to cool down like this?

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Coolers are heat exchangers

152
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
The amount of heat is infinite

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Look at this coolant inside the fan

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Shut up!

155
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't want to get in the air that's not your size!

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
The students are finally fighting

157
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
As planned

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
The cause of the conflict is

159
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Personal heat resistance test is cancelled!

160
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
It's so cool

161
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Give up

162
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
It's cool

163
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I'm glad I'm alive

164
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
It's hot

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Mr. Kagetsu, can you see the bra?

166
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
It's a bra top

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Which one should I choose?

168
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I'm grateful to be alive

169
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
What's going on?

170
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Tenkuubashi, what are you doing in the school building?

171
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,720
I'm contributing to the future of the earth

172
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
What a brilliant idea

173
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Who are you?

174
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm just a student

175
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm just a warning

176
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,720
If you're looking for a home with an idea

177
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
That's fine too

178
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
But if you use them for the purpose of the earth's earth

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,720
It might be a terrible idea to use them

180
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
What's going on?

181
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
They're not here?

182
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
What's going on?

183
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Was there a cell phone fan?

184
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I'm sorry

185
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Ariel, I did my best

186
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Let's see

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Before I put it on the Furi-ma site

188
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
I'll check if it's working

189
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
A cell phone fan that's so popular

190
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
It seems that there are many reports of the explosion of lithium ion batteries

191
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Everyone, be careful

192
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Mobile batteries are also good

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Lithium batteries are like rockets

194
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
It's a bomb that humans can barely control

195
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Don't use it if you drop the cheap one

196
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Don't use it

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
What?

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Chief, are you really going to use it?

199
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
No, it's just a coincidence

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
It's cool

201
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Due to this incident, the university released the school's rules

202
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
The student side won the competition

203
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
The time was about to come to autumn

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Autumn is the season of eating

205
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,720
The dry time of the apartment was also collected

206
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
The total price is 1.2 million yen

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,720
The police started to investigate the tents and fertilizers used for cultivation

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
The school's rules

209
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
There was a dark place like this in this university

210
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
I came to the school's school department for the first time

211
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Why did you come to this place?

212
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Well, the director of the prefectural office called me

213
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,720
I want to ask about the family property

214
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
What is this?

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Grass? Herb?

216
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,720
The dry time of the apartment was collected by 160 grams

217
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,720
No way

218
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Quiet

219
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
You're stupid

220
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Thank you

221
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
I've seen this guy before

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
It's the director of the prefectural office

223
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
No, this is not a bad grass

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
It's a pucchy

225
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Pucchy? Why are you here?

226
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
When I got the cooler fixed before

227
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
I changed the place of the self-cultivation of the circle

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I was expelled from the university because I was a member of the school

229
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,720
We, the cultural association, have a big food problem

230
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,720
I thought about diving into this basement and making a work

231
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Resistance Mooner

232
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I thought it was difficult to make various works in this shady space

233
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I started to grow pucchy, which is popular among girls and is considered a demand

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Unfortunately, the growth of pucchy is not easy

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
I want to ask you for help

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
I see

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,720
But I'd rather have my director help me

238
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
No, I'll look at the sky bridge

239
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Please, just the first time

240
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Just touch it

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Please

242
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Um, that's...

243
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't force a man to bring a woman

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
It's the opposite

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Samesu-san

246
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Do you think you can live in Tokyo like that?

247
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
What's this? It's a bad grass

248
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
What are you involved in?

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
No

250
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Is this pucchy?

251
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Who allowed you to grow pucchy in my best spot?

252
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,720
It's not allowed, it's a university site

253
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Don't start a boring job even though you're a college student

254
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Well, I understand

255
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
But do you grow pucchy in such a place?

256
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
There is no sunlight at all

257
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
That's called water-sand cultivation

258
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,720
There is a way to grow plants in artificial light

259
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Oh, the blue LED

260
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
Blue?

261
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Blue and red light are important for high school students

262
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
It's like improving growth

263
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
High school students!

264
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
What?

265
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
That's right

266
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Um, water-sand cultivation is easy to make a difference in temperature between the ceiling and the floor

267
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,720
So it's more convenient to have a LED

268
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
That's right

269
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
LED doesn't produce heat

270
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
It's the best choice compared to white-hot and yellow-hot

271
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
I knew it

272
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Um, Samesu-san

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Would you like to make pucchy together?

274
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Oh, you're so nice

275
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
What? Why me?

276
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Wait

277
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,720
I think it's good to help them and get some knowledge

278
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
I can appeal to Akihiro who is kind and kind to the students

279
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
It might be a good idea

280
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Well, it can't be helped

281
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
So, what do you need for water-sand cultivation?

282
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Thank you

283
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Um, I'm a water-sand farmer

284
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I have many roles in the soil

285
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
I feed the roots with nutrients and oxygen

286
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,720
I try not to cause any sleep

287
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
So, um...

288
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
So, you use the circulation of water

289
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
to transmit oxygen and nutrients more than soil?

290
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Then,

291
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I think we can use the water-sand with bubbles and circulation pumps

292
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
That's great

293
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
It's not a good idea

294
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
The oxygen amount is...

295
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
We can use nano-bubble shower heads

296
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
It can increase the amount of oxygen dramatically

297
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,720
by adding delicate bubbles

298
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Usually, these small bubbles disappear quickly

299
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
But when you pass through this shower head,

300
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,720
it can be more digestible, not only in the air

301
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
How is it?

302
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Can you manage the water-sand cultivation?

303
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Um, that's...

304
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,720
It's a water-sand cultivation called no-sand cultivation

305
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
But since we circulate water,

306
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
if we get sick with water,

307
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
all crops will be ruined

308
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
It's best to close the water-sand by using a water-sand

309
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Close without hurting water

310
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
We can use the water-sand, right?

311
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Water-sand?

312
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
It's from the manufacturing industry

313
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,720
The one that said that if you make a hole, human beings will be destroyed?

314
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
That's ozone

315
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
It's confirmed by its strong circulation and absorption

316
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,720
After using ozone as a gold,

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,720
it's a great product that can be used as a pesticide

318
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
I thought so, but it's no good

319
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
The half-energy is short,

320
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
and ozone will run away from the cotton we made

321
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Um, the nano-bubble shower head

322
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,720
So, to increase the compatibility with water,

323
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
maybe ozone...

324
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
That's not possible!

325
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Ask your department head

326
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,720
if he can combine this shower head and ozone generator

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Ozone nano-bubble shower head!

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
What's next? What about the cost?

329
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
We don't need the cost for the water-sand cultivation

330
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
It's fine if it's just the first,

331
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
but we're adjusting the daily life and growing faster

332
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
It's natural to use fertilizer to feed the plants

333
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
The temperature changes in the whole area,

334
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
but it's good that it's stable underground

335
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:33,700
It's like a

336
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
This coriander salad is delicious

337
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,720
Oh, Kagetsu-san

338
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
The TV reporter, Miss K-class, is doing the reporter

339
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Today, we will report on the vegetables

340
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
that students made at the K-class university for water cultivation

341
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Then, I would like to talk to the reporter, Samezu-san

342
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Hello

343
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Samezu Fight!

344
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Samezu-san, is there a safety problem with these vegetables?

345
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Students make them at the university,

346
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
so there's no problem for students to eat

347
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I see

348
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Just kidding

349
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,720
I wanted to try out how many things

350
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,720
students can do in each field

351
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
I wanted to contribute to SDGs

352
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Is it okay?

353
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
They're taking everything

354
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,720
No, there's no problem

355
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Because it became a topic like this,

356
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,720
the university side also recognized the reenactment in the school

357
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
It really saved us

358
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
No, it's the same here

359
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,720
It seems that it's being studied

360
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Everyone, the people of this earth are doing the fusion in the light of the artificial light

361
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
It's interesting

362
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Is it possible?

363
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,720
No, is it okay to do it?

364
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Is it possible to make that happy time pass by artificially?

365
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
That's not true

366
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
It's possible to make the low-class citizens use LED to make light

367
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I see

368
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Water cultivation

369
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
That's not the only thing

370
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
That's right

371
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
By using LED,

372
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
it adjusts the daily life time

373
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,720
and cycles the day for 20 hours to speed up harvest

374
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,720
This earthling's evil idea

375
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
I see

376
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
I see

377
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
If you can train soldiers in a short period of time

378
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
As expected of Senpai

379
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
You're good, Moo Moo

380
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Let's report to the headquarters immediately

381
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
With this, the rescue team will be allowed to go

382
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,720
Even so, there are people who oppose the earth in the system

383
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Kill the rebel branch

384
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Terrorist

385
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Break

386
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,720
Kill for the sake of the world

387
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
What?

388
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,720
A government killer?

389
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
A white killer

390
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm sorry, but could you throw away your boring hand

391
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
and pick up the spanner at your feet?

392
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
I'll sell this system to the rescue team

393
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Moo Moo

394
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
It's kind of worn out

395
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
If we leave them alone

396
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
We can't make a front-line base for the moon

397
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,720
The End

398
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,720
We're separated

399
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Even if we meet together, we won't be able to talk

400
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I want to be with you

401
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Anyway, I want to be with you

402
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Let's go somewhere where there are no people

403
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,720
If I can get a file

404
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,720
It's a wonderful day

405
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,720
Overflowing with power

406
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I throw everything away

407
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm alive

408
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Because you forget me

409
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
By that time

410
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I can see you right away

411
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,720
The End
