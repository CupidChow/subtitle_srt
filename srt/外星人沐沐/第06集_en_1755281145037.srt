1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
ULTIMATE BEHIND THE SCALE

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,780
This slave man is always you know, tired of your surpassing sense of freedom

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,820
So Ipanema 2015

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,580
I've got this feeling that every time I saw this film

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,580
I understand that you're getting a special position.

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,580
I thought I'd try to build a good relationship with the holders, like Moomoo, but...

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,580
...the way you've been so rough with me has made me lose my will.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,580
The insects are running.

9
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,580
I don't know what's right for your star, but...

10
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,580
...I'm not living for you, but...

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,580
...it seems like new things are exciting.

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Let's get started.

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,580
If it explodes somewhere, which one will it be?

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,580
How lonely will it be to think of this star?

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,580
If it explodes somewhere, how lonely will it be to think of this star?

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:46,580
I heard a gentle voice from the other side of the twinkling night sky.

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,580
You're the one who broke it.

18
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,580
There's no such thing as a natural thing.

19
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,580
Where are you going with a cat's head like that?

20
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I don't know what's right for your star, but...

21
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,580
...I'm not living for you, but...

22
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,580
...it seems like new things are exciting.

23
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,580
Let's get started.

24
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Hey, Sakurako. It's cold here.

25
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm going to reheat it.

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,580
I see. I was using the heat from the rice cooker.

27
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Cats can find warm places very easily.

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
That's right.

29
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,580
No, Mumu. This isn't a heater.

30
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,580
I see.

31
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,580
It was a chance to change the rice into a mobile phone that could be accessed from the stored state.

32
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
What?

33
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
This feeling...

34
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,580
Could it be a booby trap?

35
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,580
No, this is Sakurako's house.

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,580
How could something like that...

37
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,580
Mumu, watch out!

38
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,580
The recent IHE rice cooker is cooked with pressure.

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
It's a pressure cooker.

40
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,580
High temperatures allow the rice to stay fresh.

41
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,580
Best to such with perfect heat absorption toист...

42
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,580
...over 100 degrees.

43
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,280
semaine

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,580
Don't create a mortal disaster by stupidly using heat for you!

45
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,580
You are the only thing who is truly a fellow earthling!!

46
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
Th-That's not it!

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
What?

48
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
I know, Moo.

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
In order to save our friends,

50
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,580
I'll have to kill them all.

51
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
This is an inhuman trap, Moo!

52
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,580
How many of my friends are trapped?

53
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,580
I don't trust the Earthlings anymore, Moo!

54
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,580
This is the dryer that Sakurako fixed, Moo.

55
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
I see.

56
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,580
Hey, Moo,

57
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
why don't you ask the chief about the rice cooker tomorrow?

58
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,580
For now, I'll reveal the identity of that inhuman thing, Moo.

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
Then...

60
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,580
Arch-Hand!

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Best Roll!

62
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Ah...

63
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,580
You've been making a mess again.

64
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
I'm impressed.

65
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Your intellectual curiosity has surpassed your rationality.

66
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,580
So, why did the rice explode from the rice cooker?

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,580
This is because it's an IH pressure rice cooker.

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Pressure?

69
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
What's wrong with that cat?

70
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,580
It's always staring at me with its head down.

71
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,580
The cat from Umeyashiki...

72
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,580
It seems like it's acting like a human.

73
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Excuse me, what's the IH of that rice cooker?

74
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,580
It's an electromagnetic heat-shrink.

75
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,580
You can see the coil, right?

76
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
Coil?

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,580
Electric rice cooker is divided into two types of heat-shrink.

78
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,580
The rice cooker is controlled by the cheese heater under the inner frame.

79
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,580
The heat is easily integrated into the aluminum inner frame.

80
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:01,580
The IH type is a electromagnetic induction heat used to heat the next time it's generated by the coil.

81
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,580
This is more efficient in heat and has a bigger firepower,

82
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,580
so it's a superior five-point machine for rice cooker rice.

83
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,580
Electromagnetic induction?

84
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,580
I guess you can't tell, but I think I've said this many times before.

85
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,580
It was used when we made long-distance smartphone chargers,

86
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
but it generates current by changing the magnetic field in the coil.

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,580
This is electromagnetic induction.

88
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,580
And the IH cooking equipment generates current instead of magnets,

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,580
and the electromagnetic induction heat is generated by heating the bottom of the pot with its own electric resistance.

90
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,580
Um, in other words...

91
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
Huh?

92
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,580
In the end, the electric current is generated by heat, so it's the same as the cheese heater.

93
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Rather, it's more of a home-cooked meal, so it looks like it's got a lot of dust.

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
That's right.

95
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Then, take a look at this.

96
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,580
The electric stove of the cheese heater?

97
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,580
How is it? Do you get it?

98
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Um, it looks hot.

99
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,580
That's right! It's hot, right?

100
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,580
It's red and glowing.

101
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,580
In other words, this red light is the loss of power.

102
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,580
Huh?

103
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:28,580
The IH heating is efficient and has great firepower because it doesn't let the power escape from the glow.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Mom?

105
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Huh? She's dead?

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
I thought you were trying to break it.

107
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,580
I'll go outside and get it.

108
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Moo Moo...

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:09,680
It's okay, you beautiful,

110
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Moo Moo is just over-exaggerating information.

111
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
Huh?

112
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Even though she's a genius, she's over-exaggerating it.

113
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,580
What? When you human children are over-exaggerating information,

114
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,580
it's like the cheese heater that turns you into a heat source and spreads you out.

115
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,580
It's the same thing.

116
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,580
I wonder if the cheese heater was like that.

117
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,580
But it's dangerous to get any more information.

118
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
Huh? Mom?

119
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,580
It's impossible! I'm going back there!

120
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,580
She's shaking. I'm scared!

121
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
Moo Moo! She's going to die!

122
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
But why?

123
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,580
I can't stop for the sake of my friends who I know.

124
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Moo Moo!

125
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,580
As expected of you, Moo Moo Maru.

126
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,580
I will also fulfill my duty as an agent.

127
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Wait! Moo Moo!

128
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,580
The End

129
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:51,580
My mission is to restore the lost civilization by learning the technology of the earth.

130
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,580
My sword has the fate of several million allies.

131
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,800
The

132
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Some people learn technology from the electrified, mass-produced appliances.

133
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Some people investigate whether this planet's humanity is a species that should be preserved.

134
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Agents are immersed in all fields.

135
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,580
And I'm in charge of the infrastructure.

136
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,580
The infrastructure of this world is run by these slaves.

137
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,580
The slaves run the world's major economic activities.

138
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,580
All of this is for the cats to sleep and live.

139
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

140
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
The world is the same, Maru.

141
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,580
The common people are all equal.

142
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Hmph.

143
00:10:50,580 --> 00:11:01,580
I'm so tired of this

144
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,580
But even though they are the slaves of the common people, they have to be embraced.

145
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,580
The slaves are so poor that they go themselves to the human body and sell themselves.

146
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Bye-bye!

147
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,580
This is the reality of this world.

148
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
And the life form is the life form.

149
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,580
It is packed in that box and carried somewhere.

150
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Where?

151
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,580
That is decided by the forced labor facility.

152
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,580
Hey, hey.

153
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,580
It's been fired in five minutes.

154
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,580
What a number.

155
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,580
This planet is so dark.

156
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,580
All right.

157
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,580
This is just as I expected.

158
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:16,580
When you heat the water with raw rice, the molecular movement becomes active and the bond is loosened.

159
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Molecular? What is that?

160
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,580
As a result, the rice becomes easy to eat.

161
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
It's called alpaca.

162
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Alpaca!

163
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
Three hair balls.

164
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Is it really okay, Mr. Umeyashiki?

165
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Yes.

166
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Look.

167
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,580
The heating process to make it alpaca is the unique feature of each manufacturer.

168
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,580
It's a multi-purpose inner tube war due to the difference in thermal conductivity.

169
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
Thermal conductivity?

170
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Unlike the heating cheese heater, IH heats the entire inner tube.

171
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,580
So the heat is transmitted to the rice without any gap and can be heated at once with great firepower.

172
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,580
Hey, stop talking about rice bombs!

173
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,580
I can't do it without great firepower!

174
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
Hey, are you having a miscarriage?

175
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Why?

176
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:30,580
I can't be so obsessed with weapons that can harm others.

177
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
Why?

178
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,580
Why?

179
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
It's okay, Mumu.

180
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Sakurako.

181
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580
I'm not scared of rice.

182
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,580
I can cook rice without such a complicated thing.

183
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Look, Mumu.

184
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,580
The chief said a lot of things about the rice.

185
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,580
But the thing is, rice is usually dry.

186
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,580
He gave me plenty of water from the beginning.

187
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,580
I don't have a complicated rice cooker now.

188
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,580
At first, it's a little bit dry.

189
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,580
But the pot is thick, so it's okay to use it on medium heat.

190
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,580
But it's still a little bit dry.

191
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,580
Then, the rice will come out of the pot.

192
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,580
When the rice is soaked, it will be cooked on low heat.

193
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Don't cover it with a red cloth.

194
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Soak it slowly and grow rice.

195
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,580
It's done.

196
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
What?

197
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,580
Doesn't the taste change even if it's a high-class rice cooker?

198
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Yeah, we use the same rice.

199
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,580
The amateur doesn't know.

200
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,580
I'm disappointed.

201
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
Even though the price is different.

202
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
The taste is...

203
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,580
There is something that clearly changes.

204
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
That is...

205
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Yeah!

206
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,580
The texture of the rice is said to be 70% firm.

207
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
Momo?

208
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Sakurako, are you hungry?

209
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,580
Stop it here!

210
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
The End

211
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,580
When I was a student, I had a lot of work.

212
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,580
If the situation changed, I couldn't smile and look back.

213
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
I finally said it.

214
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,580
I forgot to tell you, but I'm an agent from Ise.

215
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
I'm Deshimaru.

216
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,580
After all, the cat of the privilege class is a free pass for the police.

217
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
It's a cat!

218
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,580
It's at home!

219
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,580
It's so cute!

220
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,580
The natural society of the private class.

221
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,580
The privilege class is perfect for us.

222
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Momo!

223
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
The cat is here!

224
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,580
But I know that this train moves on electricity.

225
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:07,580
The train has been running for a long time before the electric car was developed on this planet.

226
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
Why?

227
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Does the train have a huge battery only a few decades ago?

228
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
But such a space...

229
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:23,580
Just by looking at the train, it has a lot of material and power.

230
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,580
And more importantly, it doesn't run at all without any compensation.

231
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
It's so cute!

232
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Huh? This cat...

233
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,580
You're kidding, Tsurumi!

234
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Do you really not know why there are two holes in the outlet?

235
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,580
Yes.

236
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,580
That's why the exit and the entrance have a plus and minus in the battery.

237
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,580
It's hard to tell, isn't it?

238
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,580
If it's a shorter and easier to understand electric circuit...

239
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
The train!

240
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,580
The train is a typical electric circuit.

241
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,580
The electric car is built with batteries and passes through the motor from the power line,

242
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,580
passes through the wheels, flows into the rail, and returns to the electric car.

243
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,580
So...

244
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,580
Does that mean that the electricity is also passing through the cut-off rail?

245
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Yes, but I won't call it first.

246
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,580
The current flowing through the rail is at least 12 volts.

247
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,580
By the way, Tsurumi...

248
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Um...

249
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
This...

250
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Oh! Tsurumi!

251
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,580
It's a regular train.

252
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,580
Oh! Akihiro!

253
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,580
What are you looking at?

254
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,580
What's this? It's funny!

255
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,580
Hey, Akihiro.

256
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,580
Let's go somewhere more dark.

257
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,580
You're annoying.

258
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,580
Tsurumi!

259
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
Yes?

260
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,580
The chief told me about the train that the cat is on.

261
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Let's go! The plumber is here!

262
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
What?

263
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,580
I just called him because he's a little handsome.

264
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,580
There's no other guy like him.

265
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580
What?

266
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,580
Why are you catching me?

267
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
I caught the cat.

268
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,580
I don't want to give you any worries in the public.

269
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
I didn't know that they were aliens.

270
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Are they secret police?

271
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Oblique...

272
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,580
Human...

273
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
Robbery...

274
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,580
Kidnapping!

275
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Hey!

276
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
Be quiet!

277
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
How pathetic.

278
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:43,580
I'm an agent, but I can't stand it anymore.

279
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,580
I'm sorry!

280
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,580
That cat is my cat!

281
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,580
All of it belongs to my manager, Fuyuki Todoki!

282
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Come on.

283
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,580
No, Moo Moo.

284
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,580
He's the same as Sakurako.

285
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,580
What?

286
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,580
Sakurako ran desperately to save Moo Moo.

287
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
I'm sorry, Moo.

288
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,580
What a stupid bastard.

289
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:38,580
He's just standing there, looking down at the ground.

290
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
But...

291
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Hey.

292
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
I'm sorry.

293
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I'm sorry.

296
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,580
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
I'm sorry.

299
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,580
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm sorry.

305
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
I'm sorry.

306
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,580
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm sorry.

309
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm sorry.

311
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
I'm sorry.

312
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
I'm sorry.

313
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,580
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,580
The freshly cooked rice is so good.

315
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Moo wants some too.

316
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,580
That'll make him hungry again.

317
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,580
Sakurako's the one who taught Moo the taste of the rice.

318
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
And humans eat it.

319
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,580
But Sakurako hasn't been out in three days.

320
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
Don't go!

321
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Thank you for watching!
