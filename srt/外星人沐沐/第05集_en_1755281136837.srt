1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,440
her

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,860
Oh, there they are.

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,380
Did their voices get any quieter?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
Looks like...

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,420
they've broken the control literally.

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,440
I don't know if it's good or not

7
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm not living for you, but

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,440
It seems that new things are exciting

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,440
Let's start

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,440
How lonely do you think this star is

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,440
How lonely do you think this star is

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,440
I heard it from the other side of the night sky

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
I heard it from the other side of the night sky

14
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,440
You suddenly appeared

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
There is no such thing as a natural

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Where do you go with a cat like that

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
I don't know what's right in your star

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm not living for you, but

19
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,440
It seems that new things are exciting

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Let's start

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
The End

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Then go to the power station

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
If you have a request, just listen to what I say

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Yes

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Have a good day

26
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
The fact that two people went

27
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm alone too

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
What should I do

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
I wonder if the chiefs will come back soon

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I just went now

31
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Something is hot

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
If Moomoo was here at this time

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Where is the cat today?

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm not here today

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
I see

36
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Conversation is over

37
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Someone help me

38
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Help me, Kadenya

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,440
It's the most important thing

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Let's go efficiently

41
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
It's divided into two, right?

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
It's a group of Akihiro

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
The fact that those two went out

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
In that dark room

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Is the little girl and Akihiro alone?

46
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,440
I don't want to do that

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
The sky is clear

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
It's bad to be absent

49
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Eat tomatoes without hesitation

50
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Thank you

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm embarrassed

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Actually

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Tomorrow, according to the general law of the university

54
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,440
A little card game competition is held

55
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
The air conditioner in the meeting room is broken

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Badly

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Tomorrow is a summer day

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,440
At this rate, the children will be ignored

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
No, it's not

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Is there anyone who can fix the air conditioner?

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
I have to save my friends

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,440
No, I'm a newcomer

63
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
I see

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
I won't force you

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
The story changes

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Did the tomato taste good?

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm sorry

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
I said I couldn't

69
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,440
No, I don't mind just looking at it

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm sorry, Tsurumi

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,440
I just couldn't refuse

72
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,440
I ate tomatoes too

73
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,440
This is the venue for tomorrow's competition

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,440
The first meeting room of the Cultural Club Alliance

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Hot

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Akihiro

77
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Where did you get me?

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
The main research group

79
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Let's eat the jibie that Prince Hachi took

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
The Research Group for Controversial Literature

81
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Are you looking for a illusion?

82
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
The Research Group for Organic Agriculture

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Is the vitamin enough?

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
What are you doing?

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Akihiro

86
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Even if it's free here, the sun is dangerous

87
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
And now

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
It won't move

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
So, I'll leave the rest to you

90
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Wait, I'm just looking

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
I'm going to pay you back

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
So, I'll leave the rest to you

93
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
It's not working at all

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Let's change the batteries

95
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
The batteries are about to run out

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
As expected, it seems to have a full battery

97
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Hmm?

98
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Hmm?

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Um, batteries

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
That's carbonated

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Carbonated?

102
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Hmm?

103
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Probably this one, the battery for the battery

104
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Battery?

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
What?

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Ah, it moved

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
But it's not cool

108
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
It stopped

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I wonder if I have to open it

110
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
But it's impossible

111
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Senior 6th said

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,440
When an amateur disassembles or cleans

113
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
From the first appearance

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
The process of disassembly

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
It's good to leave the screw position

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Amazing camera

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Fashionable

118
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Let's try hard as an amateur

119
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Yup

120
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Um

121
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
The power is on this button

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
What?

123
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Um

124
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
This button is to take

125
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
A direct memo tape to the camera

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm not good at home appliances

127
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It was true

128
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
The sense of closeness is amazing

129
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
The power is not coming in

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
If I don't work hard, Tsurumi-kun's reputation will fall

131
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
I also somehow

132
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I have to do something

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440
The power outlet is okay

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
The power is in the first place

135
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,440
Wow, it's very dusty

136
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Let's do what we can

137
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Um, I think the cleaning of the air conditioner

138
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Cleaning the air conditioner?

139
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
This process is known to everyone

140
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,440
First, clean the dirty air filter

141
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Cleaning the heat exchanger

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
When removing the cover

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Be careful not to break the locking nail

144
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,440
And clean the dust of the heat exchanger

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Wow, the dust

146
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Further disassembly

147
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
The fan inside the heat exchanger is the most difficult to clean

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
And the cleaning robot air conditioner

149
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
It's difficult, so don't overdo it

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
What we can't do

151
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I won't overdo it

152
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I wonder if it's done

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
It's soft

154
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
It stopped again

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
No, it's not the knowledge and the work

156
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
By the way

157
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I think I was told something more fundamental

158
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
This is the refrigerator

159
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,440
And this is the outdoor air conditioner

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,440
The outdoor air conditioner is the air conditioner, right?

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
That's it

162
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
In the first place, the principle of the air conditioner and the refrigerator is almost the same

163
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
The same

164
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,440
By boldly inserting the heat exchanger into the air conditioner

165
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,440
It was possible to achieve the cooling power like a business

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
But, um

167
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
The place

168
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Be careful of the place

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,440
In a sense, the outdoor air conditioner is the main body

170
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
It's always around the outdoor air conditioner

171
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
There may be a problem with the outdoor air conditioner

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,440
The back of the meeting room is around here

173
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
This planter

174
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Wait

175
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
That planter is our cultural union

176
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
It's a waste of vegetables and other things

177
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Don't touch our vitamins

178
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
No, it's not

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
You bastard

180
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
Tsurumi-kun

181
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
What? He's protecting a woman?

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
After the perm, you want to be alone in your own world?

183
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I won't forgive you

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Tsurumi-kun

185
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
I got it

186
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
It's hot

187
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
You're handsome, it smells good

188
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I'll give you a pain

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
As I thought

190
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
It's you, Tsurumi-kun

191
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
What's this?

192
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
You bastard

193
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
It's hot

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables

195
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
If it's vegetables, it doesn't have to be like this

196
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
How can it grow?

197
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
A garden

198
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Garden?

199
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
A garden girl?

200
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
If the garden girl says so

201
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Yeah, it might be okay

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Yeah, vitamins too

203
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,440
She's definitely good at her job

204
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
I can definitely make pickles

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That woman

206
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Akihiro alone is not enough

207
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,440
She even made a cultural union

208
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
It's so cool

209
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
With this, the competition will be open without any problems

210
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
You got it right

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,440
The manager was in front of me

212
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Don't put things around the outdoor unit

213
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,440
It will reduce the heat efficiency by reducing the exhaust

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
I wonder if she has a caranter

215
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Thanks to the manager

216
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
I'll tell Moomoo about the air conditioner

217
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
The next day

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
It's already open today

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm sorry

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Tomorrow?

221
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Even if it's the day after tomorrow?

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm sorry

223
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Hey, it seems that Tenkuubashi is hospitalized

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
He said he was lying on the riverbed in the front

225
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
It's a strange experiment again

226
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
It's a self-sacrifice

227
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Sonoko?

228
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Sonoko is

229
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
What's wrong?

230
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
Nothing

231
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,440
The hole in the skull is the one that should be extracted

232
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
It's open even though there is no external injury

233
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Did you get kidnapped by aliens?

234
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Again

235
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
That's what happened

236
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Look, it's amazing

237
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
It's really open

238
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
You don't remember anything?

239
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,440
I think I saw that cat in my dream

240
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
What's that?

241
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Well, it's a dream

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I forgot

243
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,440
The alien Moomoo who appeared in this cat

244
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,440
When he couldn't get his destiny back, he became an invader again

245
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
The head of the manager

246
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
That's okay

247
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
That's the poison of the old and new group

248
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Old and new group?

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I tried to get that knowledge from my brain directly after I took the conscious person

250
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
From the brain?

251
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Moomoo realized it as soon as possible

252
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,440
The UFO was an unmanned aircraft that left the power source outside

253
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,440
It was just the same logic as the air conditioner's outdoor air conditioner, so it was easy

254
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
But the head of the manager has a hole in his head

255
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Touch here

256
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Wow, it's soft

257
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
It's soft

258
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
It's cool

259
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
He seems to be happy

260
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Well, it's a little hard to say

261
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
I'm sorry

262
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
It's okay

263
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
It's cool

264
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
He seems to be happy

265
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Well, it's a little hard to say

266
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Anyway

267
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
The technology of shooting inside the human body

268
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Anyway

269
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I'll teach you what I always want to see

270
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Sakurako?

271
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
I don't know

272
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
I don't know

273
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
The power source

274
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I don't know

275
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
I know

276
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,440
I don't know why the bones are reflected at all

277
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Oh, that's true

278
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Electrical wave?

279
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Is it X-ray?

280
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Do you understand, manager?

281
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Oh, you guys

282
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Professor Rento who developed the power source found it, but I don't know well at that time

283
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Do you want to hear about the X-ray called X?

284
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Is it a joke?

285
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
It's true

286
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,440
The mechanism of the power source is based on the characteristics of the X-ray

287
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,440
The X-ray light penetrates the human body and shoots with that light

288
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I said light, but to be more specific, it's an electromagnetic wave

289
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Electrical wave?

290
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yes, the electromagnetic wave is the wave of electricity and time

291
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,440
It's a wave of electricity that enters our lives in all kinds of ways

292
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,440
Radio and TV waves

293
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,440
X-ray of the radio and TV

294
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
X-ray that penetrates the body

295
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,440
These are all electromagnetic waves, different in length by wavelength

296
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
There are various electromagnetic waves

297
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,440
The closest one is the wave used for broadcasting and communication

298
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,440
The higher the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, the more you can carry

299
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
The range of delivery is narrowed

300
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
It's a half-price relationship

301
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Home-made Wi-Fi can't be delivered with one concrete wall

302
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Oh, that's true

303
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:32,440
5G that I've been listening to a lot lately is a large data communication, but the range is narrow

304
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,440
5G? I've heard that a lot of muckdol has died in the electromagnetic wave

305
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Oh, there was

306
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Muckdol is pitiful

307
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Shut up, Joujaku

308
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Joujaku?

309
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Certainly, the short X-ray of the wavelength and the gamma wave above it

310
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,440
It also includes radiation that affects the human body

311
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Affects the human body?

312
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Even the microwave used in the microwave in the first place is fatal to life

313
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,300
The

314
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,440
The

315
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,440
The

316
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,440
That's why the electromagnetic waves don't leak

317
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,440
There's a metal net in the microwave door

318
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,440
Even so, when you get your smartphone closer, the radio waves will be disturbed

319
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,440
That's how difficult it is to handle the radio waves

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
So the 5G from before is...

321
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Muckdol...

322
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
You idiot!

323
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:41,440
If you can make a device that can stop the president's heart with a pinpoint, I think I'm the best

324
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,440
President...

325
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:58,020
Muckdol is a great president designated by the main

326
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,440
5 months after the experiment of 5G

327
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
5 months...

328
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,440
We should find a different cause before we doubt the experiment 5 months ago

329
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
President...

330
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
That's scarier

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Is 5G safe after all?

332
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
You don't know?

333
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
No, I don't know

334
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,440
100% doesn't exist anywhere

335
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm not saying that

336
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,440
What I'm saying is that it's much more stressful to stop the progress of science with a groundless demand

337
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,440
I was the idiot who asked the president

338
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Huh? Where's Moo-chan?

339
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Moo-chan?

340
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Ah! Moo-Moo!

341
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Huh?

342
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,440
She's not here...

343
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Moo-Moo?

344
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Moo-Moo!

345
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
She's not here?

346
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Maybe...

347
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I'm the one who avoided her...

348
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Moo-Moo...

349
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Take this!

350
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Kill our farm warras carousel!

351
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
We can't use the gun here!

352
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,440
We can do it with 5G, right?

353
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Protect Vitamin!

354
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,440
President!

355
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,440
You little brats!

356
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Moo-Moo saved the president

357
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
I was just like Moo-Moo

358
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,440
I was just like the alien who tried to take the president

359
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,440
I was suspicious and scared

360
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I didn't know the situation well, but I decided

361
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,440
It's open

362
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Moo-Moo!

363
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Moo-Moo has taken over the bad power generation!

364
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,440
We're going to destroy the power generation!

365
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Really?

366
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Even if we mess up like this...

367
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Welcome back, Sakurako!

368
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Wait for me, Moo!

369
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,440
The power generation will be gone soon!

370
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Yeah! Thank you, Moo-Moo!

371
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,440
This food is too cold, Moo!

372
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
It's cold! It's cold!

373
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,440
And the TV! We can't use the internet, Moo!

374
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
What's going on, Moo?

375
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Let's get the president to fix it tomorrow

376
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
It's too uncomfortable!

377
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,440
The dog is trying to get my bones

378
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,440
The dog is trying to get my bones

379
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,440
The moon is falling on the back of the street

380
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,440
The dog's eyeball is a square

381
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Today, humanity is the first

382
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Today, humanity is the first

383
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,440
The day when it becomes an IT-controlled bus

384
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,440
It's coming

385
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,440
The day when today's humanity is the first

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,440
The day when it reaches the wood

387
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
It's coming

388
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
The day when it becomes an IT-controlled bus

389
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
It's coming

390
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,440
It will be a monkey

391
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,440
It will be a monkey

392
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
The air conditioner is cool and it feels good, Moo!

393
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,440
It's cold! The setting temperature is too low!

394
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Give it to Moo, Moo!

395
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
But Moo-Moo is wearing a costume

396
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
What? Moo is not wearing anything, Moo!

397
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
But there's a check on his back!

398
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
He's not wearing anything, Moo!
