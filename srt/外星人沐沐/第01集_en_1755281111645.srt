00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 3

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is MUMU.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
From here, the third solar system planet will be on the mission to investigate the Earth.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Auxiliary camouflage, on!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I will go into stealth mode!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is the Earth.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have a trouble! I lost control!

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The Earth will soon fall!

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I will send you information about this area.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The location of the falling point is...

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A town.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
An electronic microwave!

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Um, what's wrong?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I know. I'll ask properly.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Um, that electronic microwave...

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, that story.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The electronic microwave that suddenly appeared in 1945...

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
...was a technology that was completely new and was a complete form from the beginning.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
However, raising the temperature with the vibration of the molecules is different from the technology of the time.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is the technology of the aliens of the Roswell incident!

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The technology of the aliens?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No!

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Um, the...

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Was that me?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I can run away?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's that?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, I was there when I was in high school.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That kind of commissary.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The previous Sakura Kintaka, electronic microwave!

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
A promise not to talk outside...

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Moo is talking on the telepathy.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Can't you hear it from the others?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I told you!

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you could have made that much noise earlier, you wouldn't have been heard back.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hey, Sakurako! Hurry up and go home, Moo!

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The next day

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm done for...

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's the door to the microwave!

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Idiot!

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Where does this sound come from, Moo?

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can't even get the basic understanding of technology back, Moo!

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Geez! What are you doing?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Moo! Moo!

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't know what's right for me, but...

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not living for you, but...

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's like I'm excited about something new.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, let's get started.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How lonely do you feel when you explode?

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You must be lonely.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I heard a gentle voice from the other side of the night sky.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You suddenly appeared.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's not natural.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not sure what's right for me, but...

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not living for you, but...

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's like I'm excited about something new.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Come on, let's get started.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come on, let's get started.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, Moo!

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is one of the processes to understand the microwave.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is a process, Moo!

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't...

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You broke it again and can't get it back, right?

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Idiot!

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What? I-Idiot?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Moo is a species that can fly on the planet, Moo!

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're asking for a retort to your previous statement, Moo.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Then use that technique to get the microwave back!

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Get it back?

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not just saying that all the spaceships on the planet can fly on the planet!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you repair a smartphone that's been used up?

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can break it down and get it back, Moo!

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't, though.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here, Ropo!

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's how it's all done.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's how it's all done.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know what it is, though.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The wars that took place on their planet were very productive.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As a result of the hasty collection of wars,

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
they continued to assassinate each other's people and scientists.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They continued to destroy each other's technology banks.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Only the idiots survived.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
After that, they somehow managed to understand how to use the super-cultures.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They ate them up and came to this planet.

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Their goal was to learn from the technology that was able to understand them on a relatively low level of civilization.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They wanted to learn from their own civilization.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Learning from the technology that was able to understand them on a relatively low level of civilization.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
In order to revive their own civilization.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Isn't that endless?

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If the technology of aliens is used in the microwave,

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
if you understand it, you can quickly get closer to the technology of resurrection, Moo!

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is something that heats up the object with heat.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But the microwave only warms up the object.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Moo had a weapon that could evaporate the object in a single shot.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Isn't that the same technology, Moo?

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Even if the food itself is heating up,

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it's probably the moisture in the food.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, Sakurako.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just want you to fix the microwave quickly!

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The thing in his hand is a thing called a magnetron.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The microwave is a very short electromagnetic wave.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It seems to warm up the matter with the friction heat caused by the vibration of the water molecule.

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It can vibrate 2.4 billion times in a second.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The microwave is a little scary, Moo.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's scary.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If you don't block it with the metal net on this door, people will die.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it seems dangerous if you don't discharge it properly when discharging.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What? Why?

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
By the way, Sakurako is able to understand what you're saying, Moo.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's the electric wave's friction heat.

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Not at all.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you ask me, I don't know the role of the parts.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I bought a new smartphone as soon as it was out of condition.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's not like I can fix my commision because it's the latest model.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hello?

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, grandma?

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, I'm doing fine.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yesterday, I had a new student's new book meeting.

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, it's nothing.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
By the way, did you know that you can use Tokyo's coupons in Machida?

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, grandma, I'll call you from here next time.

127
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hey, Sakurako! Don't close it, Moo!

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I went inside to check the refrigerator, but it was broken.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I was attacked by a thin horse and trapped.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Broken?

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The refrigerator is burning like a weird fire.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I almost died.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I couldn't even fix the microwave.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a stupid thing!

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Stupid aliens! Get out!

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait a minute, Moo!

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If we don't revive Moo's star technology, our comrades will invade us!

139
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know that!

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know, Sakurako.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The missile that's stuck in this apartment!

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's a missile?

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
With this, we can destroy this country!

144
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's that?

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's an alien, and it can come to Earth.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's too big, I don't know what it is.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Anyway, we can't help it if we break it.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's investigate together, Moo.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's right.

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The next day

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is Moo.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm on the third solar planet, the Earth.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll send you information about the civilization of this planet.

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's this?

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They're burning fossil fuels and moving.

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm scared, I'm scared.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are they killing themselves?

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They're pouring water on the river.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's just right.

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The civilization level is good, but stupid.

161
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And what kind of creature is controlling this planet?

162
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This!

163
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Wait, wait, wait!

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's obviously a human being who's the social foundation.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you talking about?

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Humans are the slaves of cats.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look closely.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Humans who work with this painfully distorted expression.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I call this full-fledged train the Kano family.

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And when they can't stand the pain in that Kano family,

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
they look at the photos of cats as their target of action and smile.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,820
What a

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But Moo, it's weird that cats are the rulers.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You still don't believe me?

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Then look at this.

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That woman who's working hard to make the bento that was sold out.

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That woman who's been waiting for 30 minutes for the bento to be sold out?

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's right.

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Look at the basket of that woman.

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She's covered with a luxurious cat hat and a jacket.

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And she's wearing a cat.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
She's a fashion icon in front of the whole humanity.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And that woman is going into her own room.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I can't say this out loud.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This planet is the planet of cats.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The next day.

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why do I feel like falling into the house?

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sakurakon, why is the refrigerator cold?

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, it seems that the basic idea is that the refrigerator doesn't make cold air.

190
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's like a machine that takes heat from food and puts it outside.

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's true that the refrigerator is warm.

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The pipes running inside the refrigerator are exchanging heat like a cargo train.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It takes heat from the heat exchanger and puts it out of the heat sink.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If you keep spraying for a long time, it will cool and the tube will shrink.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's because it's rapidly de-firing the liquid inside.

196
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Sakurako, do you understand what that means?

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
For now...

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The point is the heat exchanger.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You little...

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
After all, I feel the limit of internet knowledge.

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mu-mu, let's go to the university's office for now.

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey, Sakurako, look! Those earthlings!

203
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They're lining up for lunch!

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's impossible!

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What? It's a school lunch. Is it that weird?

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, no, no.

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
First of all, it's primitive to take in food and change energy.

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm desperate to be dissatisfied with the lack of food.

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's more obvious than seeing the fire that I get into a fight.

210
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's different from the people who lost their civilization in the war.

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The weight...

212
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey, it's a great campus life, Mu-mu!

213
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Even with the same food, you're still a high school teacher!

214
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You understand Japanese culture quite well.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, Mu-mu, this is where the food is more important.

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you mean by food?

217
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a defense system, Mu-mu.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that a plant?

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, Mu-mu. It's a chemical reaction that converts energy into a solar cell.

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The ultimate echo. This is the top life form, Mu-mu.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Amazing! But why is the top class a war?

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They're fighting to take the best place in the sun.

223
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I see.

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Huh? No way! They're talking to a cat?

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh no! They saw us!

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Um, um...

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's called a phone call.

228
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Um, a phone call?

229
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I see.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
By the way, can you ask me to take the next class?

231
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But...

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Um, that class is for me...

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But the third class is open, right?

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Um, yes.

235
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yay!

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Let's go!

237
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is curry.

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You ate it before, right?

239
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's cheap and has a lot of volume.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I know.

241
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Come on, Akihiro! Let's go to a dark place!

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Sakurako, you're a human opponent. Don't be a coward.

243
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Shut up.

244
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't you want curry?

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sometimes, these primitive foods are interesting.

247
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This is...

248
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can feel the spiciness.

249
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's delicious!

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Sakurako, you'll get cold after sweating.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

252
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's it! The heat!

253
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What?

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you leave it alone, your body will get cold.

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's because you're releasing the heat by sweating.

256
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is the heat!

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's really cold, Muu!

258
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
By the way, cats only have hands and feet.

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What? That sweat...

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm sorry!

261
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's not working!

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're using the primitive theory to make curry.

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Now, we need to heat the microwave.

264
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sakurako, did you find anything?

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Not yet.

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, no!

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Hey, Umeyashiki! What are you doing?

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I told you it would be hard!

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What will you do if I drop the turn?

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're useless!

271
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Akiro won't do anything!

272
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You're useless!

273
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What? I can't hear you!

275
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's true that you're born in the snow world and have a bad tongue.

276
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You talk so softly that you don't move your mouth because it's cold.

277
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're funny.

278
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, transfer student, you're from the North?

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hey, listen!

280
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What's with the soft talk?

281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is why I hate the Commune Show!

282
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you can't even talk properly, go somewhere else!

283
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Akiro?

284
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You're really something, Hikuwa.

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Calm down.

286
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hikamitsu!

287
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't look! Don't look at my face!

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hey, girl! Your face is melting!

289
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll get you!

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No!

291
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Um, it's my fault.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Bye.

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Isn't she cute?

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That cat.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
She doesn't like me, so I'm jealous.

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm jealous.

298
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The temperature of cherry blossoms is too high.

299
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll cool it down with a heat gun.

300
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hey, Mumu.

301
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Give me your hand.

302
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If you rub it together like this...

303
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is the heat of the friction.

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Maybe the water balls are rubbing against each other in the microwave.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Really, Mumu? It's warm, Mumu!

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is the heat of the friction!

307
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's warm, Mumu!

308
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll contact the Headquarters right away.

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The heat of the friction.

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The heat that occurs due to friction.

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Mumu!

312
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Thanks, Sakurako!

313
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The future of our friends has been opened.

314
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's nothing. It's just my microwave.

315
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's all rusted again.

316
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Sakurako.

317
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I can hear Sakurako's voice well, Mumu.

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Earthlings have bad ears, Mumu.

319
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Grandma.

320
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I still can't make friends at college, but...

321
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm a little...

322
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No.

323
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Sakurako.

324
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Can I turn off the TV?

325
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
No!

326
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I've found a new classmate.

327
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Operation Jewish

328
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to the dog's bone.

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm testing the power of the wild.

330
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The moon fell on the back of the road.

331
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The dog's eyeball is square.

332
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Today, humanity is the first.

333
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I arrived at the Jupiter.

334
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The day I became a Pitecan Tops.

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm getting closer.

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The day we became the Jupiter.

337
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The day we became the Jupiter.

338
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm getting closer.

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The day I became a monkey.

340
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll be your

341
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,500
pet

342
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Sakurako, what's a microwave?

343
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,000
It's a microwave that heats up.

344
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Heat up?

345
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
When it's warm, it makes a sound.

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It makes a Pee!

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's not a microwave, it's a Pee!

348
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It sounds like it's doing something wrong by making a Pee in the microwave.
