1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The Earth, the third planet on the solar system.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The island nation of the Far East, Japan.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It suddenly came to the Nantoka Prefecture, which is out of the capital Tokyo.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The unidentified flying object's witness information from numerous civilian aircrafts...

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What!?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is this!?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What!?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is this!?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is this really a flying object!?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Which country is attacking us!?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Where should I contact!?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
C-Cops! What is the number 110!?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Idiot! Contact the Self-Defense Force!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What!? A mysterious escort!?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What should we do, Commander?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Leave it to me.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why do you think they bought their stupid fighter planes?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do something before you get into trouble.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If I forgive the feelings of a person who should have done that, the future diplomat will...

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
...die?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey, hey, what kind of joke is that?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Before you get into trouble, this is a matter of time.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Don't panic!

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Either way, it's Kanagawa.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's not my ship.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, this scale...

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure I'll be called too!

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just throw it to the core for now.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't mess with me!

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't always throw it to me, idiot!

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh my, oh my...

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is a big deal, Sakurako.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's...

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The End

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How lonely would you feel if you exploded suddenly?

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I heard a gentle voice from the other side of the twinkling night sky

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You suddenly appeared

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not natural

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Where are you going with a cat's head like that?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know what's right on your planet

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm probably living for you

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It seems like new things are exciting

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's get started

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Gah!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's dirty!

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your eyes are red and your body fluid is melting

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your illness is getting worse

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're keeping social distance!

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's why I'm saying it's a cold

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's not a cold, it's an allergy

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's an allergy...

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a job that recognizes an allergy as an intruder and the body makes the intruder go abroad

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where are you going?

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't know anything, so you're an enemy

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're going to get a sneeze

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a job that makes a substance that causes nose, tears, and sneezes

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh my

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In my planet, plants have disappeared a long time ago

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Dystopia...

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Even though it's a high-synthetic

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then you just have to get rid of that pollen

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, plants can't be lost

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I bought an air purifier to suppress pollen, but I didn't listen, so I wanted the manager to see it

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ah, you're here, minus ion

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Good morning, Sakurako

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is something wrong?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
By the way, what you brought is not an air purifier, but a cash-out machine

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So tell me, what's the effect of minus ion?

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There are various effects, but...

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a way to break down the protein in the second floor and stand on the smell

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The ion that was released in the air will change the protein

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's going to happen to the protein?

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Again, the argument

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The minus ion effect will make the protein oxidize and peel off from the skin

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
As a result, you may get a beautiful skin effect

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
By the way, it's like the skin has become smooth since I introduced that machine

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, the effect of this kind of thing is written in small letters that you can't see

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There are other effects that can be sang by just blowing off the water

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's just a humidifier

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then what is recommended?

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Air purifier for the North King's family who can't open the window because it's cold

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The performance is top level

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is the North King's Sui-den-sensei

84
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A special air purifier with a small number of air purifiers

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It doesn't have a humidifier function, so it doesn't emit mold

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It meets the requirements as an air purifier that protects the ventilation of the infection prevention measures that the Ministry of Health and Labor says

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The North King's Sui-den-sensei

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Even so, it's just a protection

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, it's best to deal with the daily pollen amount with the news pollen forecast

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, it's dangerous today

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What? Something is reflected in the distance

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:03,260
The resolution of this screen is difficult, but it's probably the star of Mu's

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What is it?

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm getting a little allergic to pollen

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm going out for a while

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hey, you're a dog!

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What should I do? Mu-mu!

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll call Anamori-san!

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What was that sound? From the top wall?

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What was that sound? From the top wall?

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Mu-mu?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's salty

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The movement of this planet is too shabby

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's like a stupid science to burn fossil fuel and run

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Where is Mu-mu?

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The agent of the Hoshuha is a lazy guy

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He showed up as a crisis to the media of this planet

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It was easy to find a place

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Which one is it?

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The professor of the university that the Hoshuha guy is showing up

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This way?

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I should have written down the brain without making a mess

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll do it here now

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No!

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
No!

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The professor of the university that the Hoshuha guy is showing up

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't come near me, Mr. Drei

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You'll get a nosebleed, earthling

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll take it before it gets noisy

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wait, don't take him with you

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're a real bastard

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't touch me

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you the agent's holder?

124
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a fat fish

125
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You shouldn't be able to swim with this

126
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Wait, I'll study harder, I'll do my best

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you're a bastard who doesn't come near me

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's not it

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The guys above saw it

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They learned the scientific power of this earth

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And they can't reach the level of restoring our civilization

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're useless

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So this planet should be a place for resources and recovery

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So you're a genius with a little more advanced science and technology

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's efficient

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In other words?

137
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't care if you kill the inhabitants

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Mumu

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You idiot!

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're going to damage my battle suit?

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't tell me you're Mumu

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you the one named Sugihagi Mumu?

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The End

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Sugihagi Mumu

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're really a bastard

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why are you the agent's holder?

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Hey, you're over here

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hurry up

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you do this, I'll kill him

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The pride of the psychic won't be used for a while by a single blow to the power

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
These guys

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Enmaku!

154
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh no, run!

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What did you say?

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You can see what a good guy thinks

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's with his strength?

158
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He's good at destroying things

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't laugh

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sugihagi Mumu

161
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why is the psycho of the assassination squad here?

162
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know what you're going to do with me

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But you stopped me, who's only a tenant once

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The situation hasn't changed at all

165
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I see

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To reverse the decision of the upper class of the core group

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Um, so we need to convince the earth's scientific power?

168
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Or maybe we can hit him and convince him

169
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, we don't need to worry about the residents of this planet anymore

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We'll make him burn to death on our ship that's about to be launched

171
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You should try it

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If you show your suspicious face, you'll be beheaded

173
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I've already sent it, idiot

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Sorry, Sakurako, I can't keep the earth

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Watch this! The earth will be destroyed by the destroy beam!

176
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The Earth will be destroyed by the destroy beam!

177
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What's going on? Why isn't anything happening?

178
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hey, answer me!

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What?

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey, what's wrong? I can't hear you!

181
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Help me!

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
A mysterious disease is spreading in the ship?

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The bacteria on the earth has swept through the air in the ship?

185
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What?

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It broke when it was on the air

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is the G-Ban, but it's important!

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

189
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It released the deck and was in a high formation!

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you stupid?

191
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hey, don't cut it!

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Damn it!

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Those weaklings are so good at attacking the planet

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I want to go! What's this?

195
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
My eyes!

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What's wrong with my face?

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What's wrong with my face?

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is it a pollen disease?

199
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Pollen disease?

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't tell me they got infected!

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is the food disease on the earth

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hello

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The food that the earthlings artificially digested into weapons has been used

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The bacteria that enters the eyes and nose mucus from the air and turns the protein of life into liquid

205
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Murderous bacteria!

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Are we going to die?

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is a possible disease!

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't understand it!

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ancient expression

210
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
People who are weak or in trouble easily believe in this

211
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
By the way, if you have the opportunity to suppress the pollen disease with the scientific power of the earth that you have made fun of

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What will you do?

213
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Is there such a high-tech thing on a star like this?

214
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Is that about this air purifier in the room?

215
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is there such a thing?

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Of course

217
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This pollen disease is a bio weapon made to prevent the destruction of the brain

218
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Of course, I have a way to get rid of it

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Look, look, the murderous bacteria are rampaging while I'm doing this

220
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What's going on?

221
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
My body is going to be a horn!

222
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The back of your eyes are itchy

223
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Poor thing

224
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Your body is melting

225
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Hey, Ale!

226
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's going up!

227
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's go back

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Go back!

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't come any more!

230
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Idiot!

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Everyone, it feels like the pollen season is coming

232
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I want to live without a mask in the middle of the house

233
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't you think so?

234
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So, this time I will introduce this earth-based air purifier

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I think everyone has realized the effect of pollen disease

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The mechanism is simple even if it is like the technology of the earth

237
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It just sucks up the garbage with the air and filters it

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, it's a vacuum cleaner

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
A vacuum cleaner?

240
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Can you really get rid of pollen?

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What's special is this HEPA filter

242
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It receives pollen and dust from filters that are folded in a pile

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, well, amazing!

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The great thing is from here

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Have you ever smelled your own scent?

246
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's...

247
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The space ship smells like a greenhouse

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Shut up!

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The space station in action smells like a greenhouse

250
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, if it smells in space, we can't open the window

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Right

252
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In the space station's small-scale program

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What is required is a compact and small-scale escape mechanism

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So, the collection and withdrawal system by the light company that was studied by Jaksa and Kyodo

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is the product I'm going to introduce this time

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't believe such a latest technology

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The world's most famous light company is Kougose

258
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
With the power of this light, the collection of the latest is realized

259
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
After all, the era is Kougose

260
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But it's expensive, right?

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you put the old airship in the basement

262
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It will be 10,000 yen more

263
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What?

264
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What?

265
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How much is that cheap Doraemon Chikujin?

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Let's get rid of it quickly

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Damn it!

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm going to burn it

269
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why is the Carnival Chief here?

270
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It seems to have been badly done

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you going to fight me again?

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Moon

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes, Maid

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Fixi

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah, the windmill?

276
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Jui-san, are you going?

277
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't want to be cured

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
For the time being, I'll put on the air purifier

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Then I

280
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll go clean up the room, so do your best with the refrigerator

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The wounds of the Sky Bridge are not so bad

282
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Did you get involved in something again?

283
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No

284
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you okay?

285
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What?

286
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why is Mr. Kagetsu talking about the captain?

287
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The other day, a runaway truck broke into the campus of the University of the Emergency

288
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The culprit was a serval cat who ran away from somewhere

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Coincidentally, the surveillance camera shows a video of the driver's seat

290
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No, this is what happened

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
A strange incident will happen

292
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's a UFO incident in Kanagawa

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's a terrible CG

294
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There are more amazing things on the net

295
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Before it comes like that, it's more of a riot than a police radar

296
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's right

297
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Culture is an external memory of knowledge and experience

298
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It is meaningful to have been passed on

299
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If you lose it, you can never get it back

300
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If you lose it, you can never get it back

301
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

302
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

304
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

307
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The man who spits out carbon dioxide

308
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The cat's eyeball is the square

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm ok

310
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,120
The day when I'll be a tropes

311
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,440
I'm getting closer

312
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,200
I'll be a monkey

313
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,320
I'll be a monkey

314
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,400
Humans have been saved by the wind

315
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,920
But I think we shouldn't blow the wind

316
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,720
We can take it with the wind

317
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
I just turned a lot of people into enemies

318
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,520
Hey! The moon account is on fire!

319
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,200
You better be careful, Pocchi Pocchi Pocchi

320
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,760
It's a lot of people!
