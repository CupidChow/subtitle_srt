00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 4

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Did you drop the Golden axe or the Silver axe?

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Both are mine.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,000
You're a liar!

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll take the axe!

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
What!?

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
No way!

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
So, the greedy Kikori lost the axe.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The end.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Huh? The reaction is...

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Look!

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
The college students came to fill in the resume for the job hunting!

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
I don't know.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm tired of this.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a game with no change.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,000
In the first place,

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is the Golden axe really useful for something made of such weak metal?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a metal that can only be stretched by tapping.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Get out of here!

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
What's the use of being a goddess?

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll come out as a horse if I buy it for money.

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm glad I'm a liar.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm just going to live lying.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm glad I'm a fool.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm not done yet.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In your heart,

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't take out the small love.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I can't take out the two of us.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You are...

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the eyes of the cleverly

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm like a ball that doesn't spin.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going to dance and clap my hands.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going on a summer day.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is the Golden axe useful?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This axe has a gold coating on the head of the Moribuden.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll tell you.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who are you guys?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you going to the volunteer?

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, that's...

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I see. You're thin, Rokugo.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ah, this is a deep reason.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Once upon a time,

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
a fat man was loved by a woman in the devs.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He lived happily.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But one day, he caught a cold and lost weight.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Her love for her father, who had made him a man,

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
was cold.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
From that stress, he lost more weight and finally broke out.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The man wanted to be more careful,

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
so he joined the circle with her volunteer.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You're not being seen by the kids.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you're a volunteer with such a bad motivation, stop it.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey, boss.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Even if Rokugo's heart is broken,

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
he's still helping the kids.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's getting along with the kids in the volunteer circle.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm in charge of the production. Rokugo is in charge of the script.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Tsurumi is helping me.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When did you guys...

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He's an important member, so I don't want him to quit.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I see! Don't erase that kid!

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have to think of a solution at once!

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I thought the gold axe was interesting,

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
but those kids are so into the theory of the world.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They know a lot about things,

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and they're trying to be mature.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What should we do about the next round of performances?

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then, let's try to get ahead.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's try something with a high-performance story.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That sounds good.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, what's that?

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's start with Momotaro.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The old man goes to the mountains,

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the old woman goes to the river.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a good idea to use the river.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't get the river dirty!

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not the river!

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The river will die!

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But I have to wash it.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then, you can use the washing machine.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a water-water washing machine that can activate the protein decomposition.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you, thank you.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, old man, there's no electricity.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why you can use the power of the river.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a dynamo generator.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It can change the rotation movement into electricity with electromagnetic induction.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a good idea, Muu.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a wonderful story that teaches kids how to use the world's infrastructure.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But, in the end, it's flowing into the river.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's expressing the strict reality there.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What about Momotaro?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's true that Momotaro isn't here.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The River of the Sun

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The peach is flowing into the river, but if you do an echo test...

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Echo test?

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you put your teeth in the air, it feels bad, so you naturally returned it.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Congratulations, congratulations.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, Momotaro isn't here.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Then, what about the story of the bamboo chicken?

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Once upon a time, the bamboo chicken Okinawa found a bamboo tree that shone in the bamboo forest.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But, it was hard to catch it, so it left its place.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Congratulations, congratulations.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why did you do that?

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Please raise it.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Think about it, you guys.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The red ginseng is blooming.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And it's grown in the bamboo forest.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Can you catch it?

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes, yes, I understand.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Then, what about Cinderella?

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't understand the meaning of glass shoes.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The Kachikachiama...

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The Showa version and the modern version have a heavy content.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wait, is this the right content for Kachikachiama?

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then, the mermaid.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The mermaid is in trouble?

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Is it an alkaline hydrolysis?

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Princess Shirayuki?

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did you run with the prince's kiss?

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then, what about...

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You guys are in trouble.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Samesu.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I understand the situation.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you want to keep the kids quiet, leave it to me.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Everyone.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Everyone.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Today, we will have three little pigs

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with the older brothers and sisters of the university.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Here comes the standard version.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I saw it from my parents' face.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's see the next meeting time.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Alright, let's go.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Once upon a time, there was a three-pig that was fat.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We are the three little pigs.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What a cute little pig.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There appeared a fierce wolf.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The cat is cute.

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's well-hidden.

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's not a pet.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's why girls...

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, no.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's run away with just the two of us.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There is a dark hiding spot over there.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Come on.

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Is it a Piel store?

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Brothers?

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm getting a little crazy.

151
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's different from the script.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go to the theater.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So, I'll be the one who's going to be the little pig.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, I'll be the one.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
With the help of scientists, we made a straw bale.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We made a block of straw bale that was compressed.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Straw bale?

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What?

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There are no scientists like that in three little pigs.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Straw bale is a great material for moisturizing.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The wolf is also a good example.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And we use the wind to suppress the angle of the roof.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:00,980
We use the

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
wind to suppress the angle of the roof.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We're not going to use it.

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The wolf, who is said to be the weakest among the three pigs,

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:22,100
is said to have suffered a lot because he was made a laughing stock in the

170
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
world.

171
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

172
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

173
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

174
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

175
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

176
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

177
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

178
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

179
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

180
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

181
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

182
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

183
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

184
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

186
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

187
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

188
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

189
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

190
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

193
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

194
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

195
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

196
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

197
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

198
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

199
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

200
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

201
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

202
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

203
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

204
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

205
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

206
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

207
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

208
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

209
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It's a little bit of a joke.

210
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
If you direct a missile at that thing, it'll break.

211
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
What's a missile?

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,100
You can't change the setting on your own.

213
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
You're the one who has the best part of each shelter.

214
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Pigs have holes.

215
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
You're right.

216
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
You're a real man.

217
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
You like to win and lose.

218
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
You're like a child.

219
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
That's what's cute about it.

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Is that your boyfriend?

221
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
What's with that face?

222
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
No way.

223
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
What?

224
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,100
You're still not interested?

225
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Hey, are we being used for a show?

226
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I don't like it anymore.

227
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Which one is volunteer?

228
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't like it.

229
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
How far have you gone?

230
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes.

231
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I understand.

232
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Let go of me!

233
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
You glasses man!

234
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
You're annoying!

235
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm going to kill you!

236
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Well, then, let's start the annual cleaning of the Human Re-releasing Research Club.

237
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Yes.

238
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,100
It's hot even in December.

239
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
It's supposed to be a busy year.

240
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Where's the head of the club?

241
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
He ran away.

242
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
What?

243
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,100
He said he was on leave, but...

244
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,100
He's not doing much, is he?

245
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I've never seen him clean up.

246
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm really happy to have Sakurako-chan.

247
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I understand.

248
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
It's hot.

249
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
What's this?

250
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Tape?

251
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
There's a white one I've never seen.

252
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
What is this?

253
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Kyoko, 30 years old.

254
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
This is...

255
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
A legendary video?

256
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
And it's a white ball!

257
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
It smells like treasure!

258
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
What's going on?

259
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Well...

260
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
But what kind of media is this tape?

261
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I've never seen it.

262
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I've never seen it, but...

263
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I want to see it again!

264
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Then I'll ask the chief.

265
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
It's me.

266
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Chief, I have a tape I don't know.

267
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I'd like you to tell me which deck I can play with.

268
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Good. What kind of tape is it?

269
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,100
It's a black, rectangular, magnetic tape recording media.

270
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Isn't that a VHS tape?

271
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I knew it right away.

272
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
If you say you like the tape, it's VHS.

273
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
What? I like the tape?

274
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
Why Kansai dialect?

275
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,100
The world's standard VHS.

276
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,100
In 3x speed mode, you can store 6 hours on 2-hour tape.

277
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
It's an overwhelming cost-per-tip.

278
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
You know it, don't you?

279
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Anyway, it's VHS!

280
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Let's find it!

281
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
I found it!

282
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
It's a small one!

283
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Huh?

284
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Small?

285
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
What?

286
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,100
It's different from VHS.

287
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
What else is special about it?

288
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Even if you say it's special, it's smaller than VHS.

289
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
It's a beta!

290
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Beta is a high-resolution recording media called Beta Max.

291
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
It can't be recorded for a long time because of the quality of the image,

292
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:08,100
but the share conflict between VHS and beta is very famous.

293
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,100
It was decided that most adult videos were supplied by VHS.

294
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Especially in the era of rental video production, most of them were VHS.

295
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
If you say AV, it's VHS.

296
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
If you say VHS, it's AV.

297
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Well, that's not it.

298
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
What do you mean by that?

299
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
It's smaller than beta.

300
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
Hey, it's not a beta, is it?

301
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Why don't you say it earlier?

302
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
What do you think when I talk about AV?

303
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Is that a handicap media?

305
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Handicam?

306
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,100
There are many other names such as video cameras and camcorders.

307
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
That evolved into this digital video camera!

308
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
Right.

309
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Isn't that VHS-C?

310
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
VHS-C?

311
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,100
It's a compact tape that can be seen in VHS decks.

312
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,100
The moment you combine it, you get excited.

313
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Oh.

314
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Um, it's too big to fit in.

315
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
What?

316
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's a high-eight.

317
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,100
If you say the tape you like, it's a high-eight.

318
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
It's a high-eight!

319
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
It's a real deck.

320
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
There's no high-eight.

321
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
There's no high-eight.

322
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Well, it can't be helped.

323
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I can't connect the video anymore.

324
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Huh?

325
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
It's the chief's suit.

326
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Why?

327
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Oh, there, there.

328
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Camcorder.

329
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Is this it?

330
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,100
The camcorder is a deck, and it's connected directly to the monitor.

331
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,100
I see.

332
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Then I'll cut it from the back.

333
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
I'll cut it!

334
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
All right, let's play!

335
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Hurry up!

336
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
All right, come on!

337
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

338
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Huh?

339
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
A child?

340
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
This child is...

341
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I'm going to start recording the research and development.

342
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Could it be the chief?

343
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
It looks like it.

344
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Today, I'm going to change the location of Uraimu and experiment.

345
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,100
The previous experiment was a mess, and the use of the nearby park was difficult, so I can't help it.

346
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
This child is the chief.

347
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
There's no doubt about it.

348
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Then I will conduct a third experiment of the fully automatic pet washing machine.

349
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Stop it!

350
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
The stuffed animal's gums are coming out!

351
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
A pet washing machine?

352
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,100
The water is still sweet.

353
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
The cats won't dry up like this.

354
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,100
You know that stuffed animal, don't you?

355
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
Why?

356
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,100
It's hard to put Tezura in the bath.

357
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Huh?

358
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
The chief's mother?

359
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Miss Campus looks just like Koma-chan.

360
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
That's right.

361
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Hey, hey, are you a mother-in-law?

362
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Damn it, Kaha-chan, you're so energetic.

363
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Well, I'll take it back and start the experiment again.

364
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Full automatic pet washing machine.

365
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,100
By pushing the motor into the pressure pot lid and turning it upside down...

366
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
The lid is flying!

367
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Full automatic pet washing machine.

368
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,100
A powerful model that utilizes the washing power of the washing machine.

369
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
Hey!

370
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
The washing machine is not a food-based dog!

371
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Full automatic pet washing machine!

372
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Full automatic pet washing machine!

373
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I get it!

374
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Full automatic futon-pouching machine!

375
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
Full automatic CM-cut recording system!

376
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I like the fully automatic.

377
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,100
Is it an era?

378
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Is it a longing for the future?

379
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Or rather, isn't the one the chief is making all for his mother?

380
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,100
That's true.

381
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Finally, Kaha-chan can't walk anymore.

382
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:18,100
It's faster than that stupid doctor said.

383
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Full automatic pet washing machine complete.

384
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I want the full automatic pet washing machine complete as soon as possible.

385
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
I will definitely make it complete!

386
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Kaha-chan!

387
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Wataru?

388
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Ah, I got this from Matsumaze and the shopping cart.

389
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,100
It has an electric assist, so it's not heavy even on the slope.

390
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,100
The battery is given by the electric char.

391
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,100
When Kaha-chan moves forward, the power is turned on.

392
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
No?

393
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,100
And then, the automatic brake is also improved in the block part of the castor,

394
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
and the safety of the step is realized.

395
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Wataru?

396
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,100
It's amazing.

397
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:25,100
...

398
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Eh?

399
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
That continuation is...

400
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
It doesn't seem to be there.

401
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
It ends here.

402
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
No way!

403
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
That's...

404
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Kyoko, was it about the chief's mother?

405
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:54,100
...

406
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,100
...

407
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,100
...

408
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,100
...

409
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
It's the chief!

410
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Um, chief?

411
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Hey, I didn't expect it.

412
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
That tape says Kyoko.

413
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
If so, I will never see it.

414
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I will definitely...

415
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Wataru, you should be quiet about your cousin's wedding.

416
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Wataru, why is your tie black?

417
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
Fix the toy.

418
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
You guys haven't seen it.

419
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,100
I know, I know, chief.

420
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,100
I know, I know.

421
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,100
You guys are definitely mistaken.

422
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Hey!

423
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,100
We are separated

424
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:21,100
I want to be with you

425
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:28,100
I want to be with you

426
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Anyway, I don't have enough time

427
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Let's go where no one is

428
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,100
When the break is over

429
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:55,100
The power of wonderful days overflows

430
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:02,100
I throw everything away and I'm alive

431
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Because you forget me

432
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:16,100
By then, I can see you right away

433
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Do you know about the Umiyashiki video?

434
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Yes, I was told to record that show when I was at home.

435
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Even if the things disappear, the words remain.

436
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Rental videos and back videos.

437
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Back video?

438
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Back video?
