1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,420
This is an ad.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,060
You're witnessing an unknown Ã€saa replacement!

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,520
What did she do to you?

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,420
It's an admin's service anti-out hunts!

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,860
Reproach the success rate by worried colleagues and treat them as an enemy!

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:29,240
What is it?!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,660
Aah...

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,460
Whew.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,380
I was still in a part-time job when I recorded this week...

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,460
I'm back.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,640
Humans are really stupid!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Muah, Muah. I'm going to start studying the home appliances.

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,740
Yeah. I'll do it when this show is over.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,040
Oh, no!

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,540
You promised that the TV would be on for two hours a day, didn't you?

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,140
It's not even two hours yet, Muah.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,340
No way. You've been watching it all morning.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,460
Do you all remember?

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,300
The mysterious incident that occurred in this strange river?

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,580
What?

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,920
Many images have been posted on social media,

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,880
and there have been many claims,

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,120
and there have been many claims, but no answer has been received.

24
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,120
This river is close to our home?

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,520
Or rather, this is the UFO that Muah destroyed.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,480
What?

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,440
During the incident, the man discovered in this river

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,600
was able to interview the T-Shirt.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Hey!

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,100
Chief!

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,040
Cosmetic

32
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
It's like a dream.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Come on, let's get started.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
How lonely would you feel

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,600
if you exploded suddenly?

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
How lonely would you feel

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
if you exploded suddenly?

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I heard a gentle voice

39
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,600
from the other side of the twinkling night sky.

40
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,600
You suddenly appeared.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,600
There's no such thing as a natural thing.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Where are you going with a cat-like look?

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I don't know what's right on your planet,

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,600
but I'm probably living for you.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It's like a new job is exciting.

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Come on, let's get started.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I don't remember anything.

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
But I heard there's a hole in the top of my head.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,600
And my head is so swollen.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,600
That's called cattle mutilation, right?

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
You know that?

52
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,600
There's also a rumor that a metal part of the road has fallen.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
The field verification continues.

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Metal part?

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
That's the UFO that fell off the moon.

56
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
This is bad.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,600
But this won't be enough to expose Moomoo.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
The next corner is today's cat.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Today, we're going to shop at the convenience store.

60
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,600
The big release of the internet, the 100-million-yen car.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
You're making a fuss.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
What are you doing, Moomoo?

63
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
I went to buy a Sakura-ko body-heat system.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Oh, really? Thank you.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
What are you going to do?

66
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
You're spreading it out like this.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
This is certainly a problem.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Some people on Earth should think that Moomoo's existence is known.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Is that the thing that aliens get caught in the army and dissected?

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Could it be that Moomoo is also...

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
No, it can't be.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Hey.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Huh?

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
The police?

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
No way.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm thinking too much.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
But it's like they were looking at me.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
What a cunning guy.

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
But I have to protect him.

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, right.

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,600
I think the security goods that the chief got here...

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
It's dangerous for a woman to live alone.

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll teach you the security goods that can be used in the house.

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
First, the knife.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
You think I'm crazy, right?

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Yes, the knife is short, but it's not for your own use.

88
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
What the hell is this?

89
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
If you're bad at it, you can't kill your opponent.

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
So I recommend...

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Stangun, which is also in the house.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Huh? I don't have it.

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
You don't, do you?

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Stangun has a retainer.

95
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Stangun has a retainer.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
High voltage but low current, so it's safe for the body.

97
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
And you can use it without considering your opponent's safety.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
This is good for the amateur.

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,600
High voltage and low current are safe?

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,600
You can't imagine that?

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,600
High voltage and low current are safe for the body.

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
No one would die from that.

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
I see.

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Well, if you feel the danger of your body, use Stangun without hesitation.

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Stangun?

106
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Who am I going to use it for?

107
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Okay.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Huh? Who is it?

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Excuse me, it's the police.

110
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
You're here, right?

111
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Umeyashiki-san! Umeyashiki-san!

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
It's okay.

113
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,600
I heard he's alone, and if he knew he was a stranger, it would have been a big deal.

114
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I-I guess so.

115
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I knew it, Uchusen.

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Mom!

117
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey!

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Stop it already!

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
Senpai!

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Shiberia!

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Senpai, you were going to kill Anamori, weren't you?

122
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
No, I wasn't.

123
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
What are you going to do about it?

124
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
He was a tough guy, so I just...

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Just? Why do you always do that?

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,600
You break UFOs and try to spread the parts, or you buy things in front of people and spread them on social media.

127
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
And you spread it on TV, too!

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Why are you making me suffer?

129
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,600
And I'm being chased by a bunch of people, and I'm a little fat.

130
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
This is so chewy!

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
It's weird, Senpai.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Why would you suddenly go into a house with UFOs?

133
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Are you stupid?

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I thought you were going to kill me.

135
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
His name is Shiberia.

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,600
It's easy to tell if you say his name is Moomoo and Dorui.

137
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Dorui?

138
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Shiberia's job is to support Moomoo's studies.

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
In other words, it's a job for me.

140
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
That's why my job is the best for me.

141
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Um...

142
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm Junichiro Anamori.

143
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm a police officer working at the police station.

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Nice to meet you, Sakurako.

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm sorry for making you surprised earlier.

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
You told me to make a request to Shiberia.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Of course.

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
Anamori was going to change that UFO's

149
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,600
and he broke his bones.

150
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
You?

151
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
Yeah.

152
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
If you know that aliens have invaded the Earth,

153
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
the world will turn upside down.

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
He looks like a nice guy,

156
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
but he's a little noisy.

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Can I trust him?

158
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Sakurako, I want to support your life.

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
You're having a hard time with the electricity bill every month, right?

160
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Yes.

161
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Let us pay for it.

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I'll pay for it.

163
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Really?

164
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah.

165
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I want you and Moomoo to focus on studying home appliances.

166
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Thank you, Anamori!

167
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
He's a great guy!

168
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I can get a job now!

169
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
You're so easy to understand.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm counting on you.

171
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm counting on you.

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
You know what?

173
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,600
I'm going to study the Earth.

174
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm going to study you and Moomoo.

175
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
What?

176
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
The Earth?

177
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Oh, no.

178
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
It's okay.

179
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,600
I'll support you if you need help.

180
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Anamori, that's a secret weapon.

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Really?

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
That UFO's is a little bit strange.

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I'm going to use it as a weapon.

184
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm going to be a neck.

185
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Bye.

186
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
He's so annoying.

187
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

188
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
The FBI has infiltrated the city to search for aliens.

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Be careful.

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Senpai, one last thing.

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,600
The rescue team is moving too.

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Please be more careful.

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
The FBI?

194
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Rescue team?

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
What should we do, Moomoo?

196
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Huh?

197
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Do I need more stunts?

198
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
The Earth

199
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
You know what?

200
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
The Earth is going to study you and Moomoo.

201
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I have to focus on studying my homework.

202
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Right, Moomoo?

203
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Miru-mu, Sakurako, you lowly Earthling gag.

204
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
What's going on, Moomoo?

205
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
You're using the computer that's attached to the UFO.

206
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm studying.

207
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,600
I was going to do it now, but I lost my motivation because of Sakurako.

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I'm going to study with you.

210
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'll reserve this program.

211
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
No, Moomoo.

212
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
This program is a two-way program.

213
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Moomoo, do you know what a two-way program means?

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Everyone in front of the TV,

215
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Please deliver your power with a remote control and save the Earth.

216
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Save the Earth.

217
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,600
A two-way program is an interactive service that viewers can participate in.

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll connect the TV to the Internet, so it's not strictly digital broadcast.

219
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I've got a lot of points.

220
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I might get a T-shirt for the program.

221
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Thank you.

222
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
The Earth was saved by everyone's power.

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
See you next time.

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Goodbye.

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
It's over.

226
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Then let's start studying.

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I borrowed a lot of home appliances from the library.

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Really?

229
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I wanted to watch more TV.

230
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Do you have any interesting appliances?

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Hello, TV.

232
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I can't wait to watch TV.

233
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
TV is good.

234
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
What's the history of TV?

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
I don't care about history.

236
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
That's right.

237
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
It's about the TV system.

238
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,600
The TV station changes the video to an electric signal.

239
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
I send the video to each station.

240
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
The electric signal and the radio are impossible.

241
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I told you about radio before.

242
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,600
When the frequency of the radio increases, it becomes a light.

243
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,600
When the radio is received, the beam from the electronic beam hits the fluorescent light.

244
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
That's Brown-can TV.

245
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't know such a hot TV.

246
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
It's the age of LCD TV.

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
That's right.

248
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Tokyo Sky Tree was made in accordance with the Chideji.

249
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Do you know why it needed a height of 634 meters?

250
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,600
It needed a high frequency electromagnetic wave that could transmit more information by Chideji.

251
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Why does a high frequency electromagnetic wave need a height of 634 meters?

252
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
I'm not interested in that.

253
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,600
I see.

254
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Let's break down the TV like before.

255
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
I'm sure you can understand.

256
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,600
If we break down the TV, we can't watch it.

257
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
The microwave is broken down.

258
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I want to watch TV.

259
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
I want to watch TV.

260
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I want to watch TV.

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,600
After all, the fate of the earth is at stake.

262
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
It's up to you and Moo-Moo to study.

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Moo-Moo, let's study properly.

264
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I absolutely don't want to study.

265
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I don't know.

266
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Sakurako.

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Yay! I can watch TV.

268
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I'll watch this, Sakurako.

269
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I'll record it for you.

270
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
I'll watch it later.

271
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Hello.

272
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I haven't done any interesting programs.

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Sakurako is late.

274
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
It's too late.

275
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
The Earthlings are the Earthlings.

276
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Do you understand Sakurako's laugh?

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,600
I don't know.

278
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I saw Moo-Moo laughing and I was caught.

279
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
I'm sure I'm lost because of that stupid Sakurako.

280
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,600
But it's not wise to look for it.

281
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Finally, we're alone.

282
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
You came to pick me up?

283
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
You came too?

284
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Dejimaru, did you see my Sakurako?

285
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I didn't see it, Maru.

286
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Did something happen, Maru?

287
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
I just had a fight.

288
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
A fight?

289
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Let's look for it together.

290
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm so sorry, Maru.

291
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I'll lend you one.

292
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Akihiro, there's a place with a light-shadow ahead.

293
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Sorry, I'm going home.

294
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
It's really dark!

295
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Dejimaru, is there a place?

296
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,600
There's a place where people who are living in the lower realms can rely on when they're in trouble.

297
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
If you go there, you'll know something.

298
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm tired of living with the source of the infrared sensor I taught you!

299
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Dejimaru, you're heavy!

300
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Moo, why are you so heavy?

301
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Hey, cat! Go away!

302
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Senpai!

303
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Sakurako is gone?

304
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Senpai, you just said it!

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
It's a good fortune for the Earth!

306
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
That's why I'm reflecting on it!

307
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
That angry, grumpy girl...

308
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Maybe she's been possessed by something.

309
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
She's a trouble maker, really!

310
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
She doesn't know about Siberia or Anamori.

311
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Sakurako might have been caught in a national conspiracy!

312
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
How cute!

313
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
She's lost her pride as a warrior.

314
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Senpai, please die once.

315
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Senpai, do you have any clues about where she went?

316
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Clues?

317
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Hmm...

318
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
The Tokyo Sky Tree was made to respond to the Earth's Earthquake.

319
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Do you know why it needed a height of 634 meters?

320
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Hey, Senpai!

321
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
I remember, Moo.

322
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,600
The radio waves become light when the frequency increases.

323
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
The characteristic of light is that it reflects without going through walls.

324
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:09,600
In other words, the high frequency of the Earthquake will also reflect on the buildings and other objects like light.

325
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
In order to send direct radio waves to each household,

326
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
the Sky Tree needed a height of 634 meters.

327
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
I'll apply this principle.

328
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
If you're interested in Sky Tree,

329
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
you can find Sakurako without being disturbed by the objects in the school.

330
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
No, I'm just looking down from a high place.

331
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
That's the appearance of a warrior.

332
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Where, Moo?

333
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Sakurako!

334
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Where are you, Moo?

335
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
The power station?

336
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
There it is!

337
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What are you doing, Moo?

338
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Oh no!

339
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Please tell me more about the TV system!

340
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Sakurako...

341
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
I'm home.

342
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Sakurako!

343
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Moo?

344
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
This is not right, Moo!

345
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Moo!

346
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
The TV is being reassembled right now.

347
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Oh, well.

348
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
This is...

349
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Yuuki Ieru TV!

350
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
I bought it!

351
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Let's watch it together!

352
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Sakurako...

353
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Let's watch it together!

354
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Moo, Moo.

355
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,600
I just heard the explanation from the power station.

356
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,600
The difference between Yuuki Ieru TV and a normal TV is the way the panel is exposed.

357
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Nisan is exerting carbon,

358
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,600
and that child is breathing.

359
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
The child is breathing.

360
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
The child is breathing.

361
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
The child is breathing.

362
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
The child is breathing.

363
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
The child is breathing.

364
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
