00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 5

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,580
Yes! Today, I'll introduce you to the

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,580
Loved-up Maneki Cat!

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,580
I'll give it to you for 500 yen!

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,580
Ah...

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,580
Yeah, it's fine.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,160
Hey, just try it for now, okay?

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,660
No, no, I can't.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Don't say that!

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,460
If you write your name on it, you can get closer to the Loved-up!

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,460
That's really fine.

12
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,620
Please!

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,120
You ordered 500 of them by mistake!

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,120
If you don't sell it this month, our Miko Circle will be destroyed!

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,460
Here's your coffee.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,460
Did you write your name on it?

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,960
Wait, don't look at it.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,960
If you look at my name, it'll be less effective.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,960
Then, put it in this Loved-up Maneki Cat,

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,460
and carry it around without letting it go.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,460
This is really amazing, okay?

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Well, I don't care about it.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
This time, you're really good at fighting, auntie!

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,460
That again?

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,460
From the twinkling, twinkling starry sky

56
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,460
I heard a gentle voice

57
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,460
Suddenly, you appeared

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,460
It's not something that's natural

59
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,460
Where are you going with a cat's head like that?

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,960
I don't know what's right on your planet

61
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm probably living for you

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,960
It's like I'm excited about new things

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Let's get started

64
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
What's so great about it?

65
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
The rate of production is crazy!

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
What kind of person is he?

67
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
He's a home-made man who gets involved with that girl.

68
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,460
What's wrong?

69
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,460
What's wrong, Sonoko?

70
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,460
You don't know?

71
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
You don't know?

72
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,460
It's hot!

73
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Sonoko, that's...

74
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Oh, no!

75
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Hey, you, Sky Bridge!

76
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,460
You're in trouble again!

77
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,460
I just caught a cold from Kagetsu-san.

78
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
That's terrible!

79
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,460
I knew it!

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
I can't let this guy live!

81
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Wait, this is wrong...

82
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Sonoko, are you not burning yourself?

83
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
He saved me!

84
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,960
He poured water on me so I wouldn't get burned!

85
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I see...

86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
If Kagetsu-san says so...

87
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
That jacket.

88
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
What? A jacket?

89
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
This is bad!

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Pervert!

91
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I knew you'd agree to coffee.

92
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,960
And I also agree to the dirt on your neck.

93
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I'll make this Sky Bridge drop the cardigan's stain.

94
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
What is he saying?

95
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I'm not going to let you live!

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
That cardigan...

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Wait a minute...

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
Wait, wait, wait!

99
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
No!

100
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Don't get involved with him!

101
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,460
Wait!

102
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
Um...

103
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Why are you holding a girl's cardigan?

104
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
This is...

105
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,460
I'm scared, I don't want to hear it!

106
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
I don't want to hear it!

107
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,460
It's from Kagetsu Sonoko.

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,460
Miscanvas' dead body!

109
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,460
I'll clean it up.

110
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
This stain is pretty dirty.

111
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Where do you plan to drop it?

112
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Here.

113
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,960
This is the back of the coin laundry of the Human Reconstruction Research Society.

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
There's a place like this in the back of the room.

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,960
We're maintaining the recovered washing machine and operating it as a coin laundry at a low price.

116
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,960
It's a secret that you're disposing of water and electricity from school.

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
That's...

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
No! This is a test!

119
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
This is not a goal to exchange money!

120
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Um, excuse me, is this...?

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Yes, sir!

122
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,960
Oh, you're so smart!

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes, there are many foreign dirty machines that are separated from the washing machine.

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
I envy the country that has two washing machine-sized cubes.

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,960
This is how the coin laundry industry is now on sale.

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,960
The vertical washing machine is required to rotate to remove water with its centrifugal force.

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,960
In order to reduce the vibration of the centrifugal force, the water tank is hung by a bamboo-heated fishing rod.

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,960
It's like blowing up a 50-year-old tower or sky tree with a new pillar floating for the sake of the earth.

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:11,440
Oh, I think it's a bit of a logic that our human rocket cockpit is floating in the shock-inducing

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
What the hell is that box for?

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
There's no way there's a machine just for washing clothes.

132
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
It's over.

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,440
As I said earlier, the water washing machine of the drum type is the main stream in Europe.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
It's because water is high water and detergent is hard to dissolve.

135
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Also, the drum type of the tap washing is close to the old habits.

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,440
So, is it a good idea to use Japanese warm non-cleaners to wash?

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
It's not a good idea. It's too hot and the detergent will die.

138
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Everyone is wearing the remaining pump, so they're just wearing it.

139
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,440
You know, washing is a chemical reaction.

140
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,440
The smell of acid, the dirt of coffee, and the dirt of the semen.

141
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Let's start from the place where it is decomposed with alkaline detergent.

142
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
The key is here.

143
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
It's here!

144
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
It's a chemical reaction.

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,440
During the planet wars, there was a bio-weapon that decomposed only living things.

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm sure that code name is...

147
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Landry!

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
He's choking.

149
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,440
It's a deep place, but it's still alive.

150
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
There's a girl with a sign.

151
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
A girl?

152
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

153
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,440
My wife is crying with a beautiful smile.

154
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
A boy student is coming from somewhere.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah! Yeah!

156
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
It's a double-washed washing machine that can be washed twice at 40 degrees and 80 degrees.

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
It's a double-washed washing machine that can be washed twice at 40 degrees and 80 degrees.

158
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
There's a roller on it.

159
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I've thought about it.

160
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
In the first place, the water is drained by that centrifugal force.

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,440
The dirt that has been dropped has become a filter and is being re-absorbed.

162
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,440
The old roller water is the best idea!

163
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
No!

164
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,440
If you use such a powerful force to drain the water from the wet cloth...

165
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,440
The sleeves are torn inside.

166
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
The endurance of the clothes is...

167
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I was thinking about it.

168
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Normally, you should be aware of it at first.

169
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
What? I thought it wasn't in the room!

170
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
That's my card!

171
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,440
Um, what's inside the pocket?

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
What? Inside?

173
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I didn't check the pocket!

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I should have checked! Don't check it!

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Is there something in it?

176
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
There's nothing in it.

177
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
What?

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
There's something stuck in the drain.

179
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
This is...

180
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
This is...

181
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Um...

182
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
It's different!

183
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,440
This is not the original shape anymore.

184
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Cat strap?

185
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
It's like a garbage dump.

186
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
It's a roller that drains the pressure.

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll make it up!

188
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
I'll make it up for sure!

189
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
No! It's fine! I'm fine!

190
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
But...

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
If you forgive me, I don't plan to attack you in the first place.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Actually...

193
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Um...

194
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Thank you for helping me when I spilled coffee.

195
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
No problem.

196
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Thank you.

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Was that girl okay?

198
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:22,020
Hey, where are the

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You're talking about something else again.

200
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,440
A phone that was completely drained...

201
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
It's broken.

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I wanted to dry it, but it broke when I heated it in the microwave.

203
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Can you fix it?

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
That's bad, handsome.

205
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I'm sure you've only used the microwave for women.

206
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
For women?

207
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
The battery is so high that the circuit is burnt out.

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
It's a valuable sample.

209
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,440
How is it? Can you fix it?

210
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
You're amazing, Tsurumi.

211
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,440
You're so friendly even though you're good at machines.

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
What? It's impossible.

213
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Stop it, Tsurumi!

214
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Don't make a fuss!

215
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't want to think I'm serious.

216
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Watch out, Tsurumi!

217
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm sorry.

218
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Oh, my.

219
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
The first step is important.

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I knew it when I entered this circle.

221
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Something fun to get along with everyone...

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Something fun...

223
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Um...

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
What?

225
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Would you like to have tako-pan?

226
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,440
There was a hot plate with takoyaki.

227
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
I found it when I was cleaning the room.

228
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Tako-pan...

229
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440
We didn't have that idea.

230
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
You can use the kitchen if you like.

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Thank you.

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,440
I even borrowed it from my house.

233
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,440
It's okay.

234
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,440
It's the first time to make takoyaki at home.

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
It's normal in Kansai.

236
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,440
But recently, you're better at making frozen ones.

237
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
You're saying that again.

238
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Say sorry to Sakurako.

239
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I'm so motivated.

240
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,440
I like takoyaki, so I'm looking forward to it.

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
It's easy to understand.

242
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
What's going on?

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
What's going on?

244
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Why are you so excited?

245
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
It's not that.

246
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
It's here.

247
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Um...

248
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
It's here.

249
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Tako-pan.

250
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Just takoyaki.

251
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
What's the problem?

252
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,440
You can't use a hot plate with a lot of power.

253
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
It's an extension cord.

254
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,440
It says 1300 watts on the hot plate.

255
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,440
It says the extension cord is up to 1200 watts.

256
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
You're right.

257
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,440
That's why you use power directly to the outlet.

258
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Why don't you use this?

259
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,440
The outlet is broken.

260
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,440
That's why I pulled it.

261
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You're a coward.

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Leave it.

263
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I can't do anything about it.

264
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
No!

265
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
What about tako-pan?

266
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm not going to ask you anymore.

267
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Don't worry, Umayashi-Ki Sakurako.

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I won't let those tako-pan's go to waste.

269
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,440
I always carry a new outlet to see if something like this will happen.

270
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,440
But if you do something like that now...

271
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
the sun will set.

272
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
You think so, right?

273
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,440
The outlet made in the Tsukou Castle in Matsushita, Mie,

274
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,440
is high-precision, so you have to plug in the wiring with one touch.

275
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I have a license.

276
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,440
With this outlet, the construction time has been drastically shortened.

277
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,440
How many electric lights have been able to meet the needs of their parents?

278
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
The old outlet...

279
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Inflat...

280
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Considering the maintenance of the equipment,

281
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
the ease of replacement is important.

282
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
And it's high-quality.

283
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
The chief is really good at this.

284
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,440
The current outlet is 6 seconds with one.

285
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I'll borrow some mayonnaise.

286
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
Okay.

287
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440
If it's a Ninobe ginger, it's even better.

288
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Tsurumi.

289
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Can you call Mr. Samezu?

290
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
He's been really nice to me the other day.

291
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,440
He said he wanted to thank me.

292
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
I see.

293
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Okay. I'll try to contact him.

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Thank you.

295
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Mr. Samezu? A girl?

296
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,440
This factory is a full automation company.

297
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
It's a company that's not inferior to the Chinese.

298
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,440
The quality and cost performance are both great.

299
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,440
This is the new model that's made in Japan.

300
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,440
You heard about the factory before.

301
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Yes. I just went to see it last month.

302
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Let's watch the video.

303
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
The current outlet is the second-generation of Nishi-e Nishi-e.

304
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,440
It's the world's second-largest share of Nishi-e Nishi-e.

305
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
All you have to do is take care of America.

306
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Let's watch the video.

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
What do you want to eat?

308
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Octopus, green onion, tenkasu, and green ginger.

309
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
There's kimchi and cheese in the fridge.

310
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Let's watch the video, kitty.

311
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Hey, go away.

312
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
How cute.

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Who's there?

314
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
This breaker is from Matsushita Denko in Aichi.

315
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
And it's the latest model.

316
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Do you need that information now?

317
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
It's over.

318
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh, you're here.

319
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
As expected of the chief.

320
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Yo, Mr. Denkiko.

321
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Thank you.

322
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,440
I made it at home like this, in a plastic bottle.

323
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Oh.

324
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Here you go.

325
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Hey, girl.

326
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
It's a game.

327
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Yes, I'm here.

328
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Oh, you're good at returning it.

329
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
You're good at it.

330
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
What are you doing, kid?

331
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,440
It's a takoyaki battle with a woman's will.

332
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
It's a self-rotating machine with vibration.

333
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
It's a great thing that can make the restaurant taste at home.

334
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
You can also make a dish.

335
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Here you go.

336
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
Wow, it looks delicious.

337
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
It's hot, so be careful.

338
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,440
This tastes strange.

339
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,440
It's Italian style with bacon, mozzarella cheese and mini tomatoes.

340
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
As expected of Mr. Samezu. It's fashionable.

341
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Both are delicious, but I think the normal takoyaki is better.

342
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
I don't know.

343
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Sakurako's victory.

344
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
I won't lose next time.

345
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Will you meet me next time?

346
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Ms. Umeyashiki, I got along with Mr. Samezu.

347
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Yeah, yeah.

348
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't get along with him.

349
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm going home.

350
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
What? Already?

351
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I feel sick when I'm with you.

352
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Oh, Mr. Samezu, again.

353
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
If you feel like it.

354
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
It's delicious.

355
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
The takoyaki made by Sakurako Umeyashiki is made in China.

356
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
What do you mean?

357
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
It's a story of the emperor.

358
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,440
A large number of human-made products.

359
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:37,440
The Japanese home appliances industry has been hit by the high-cost performance of the high-cost appliances that have no decoration and simple functions.

360
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
But the Chinese government has been forced to stop the production of appliances.

361
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:51,440
But in response to the Chinese system, Matsushita's Tsukoujo was determined to make full automation and realized a speedy and reasonable manufacturing.

362
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
You're here again, Tsukoujo.

363
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Yes, to put it in a good way, like this frozen takoyaki.

364
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:09,440
By focusing on frozen food automation, not only did it make fast-frozen food possible, but also realized mass production in Japan's narrow environment.

365
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:18,440
And by doing fast-frozen food with minus 40 degrees of air-conditioning, it was able to maintain the quality that was damaged by the previous distorted cooling.

366
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Of course, by reducing the growth of gold at the peak of the world, it is not necessary to preserve it.

367
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,440
You're a good guy.

368
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I understand.

369
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
This frozen takoyaki is written as Made in China.

370
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,440
It's a terrible Made in China.

371
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Um, and...

372
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I know frozen takoyaki is delicious, but I think it's a difficult task to share the process of making it.

373
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
A theory of the law?

374
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Above all, when you're eating, you can feel relieved when the person who made it is in front of you.

375
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,440
If it's someone like Umeyashiki, it's probably...

376
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Um...

377
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Thank you.

378
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Thanks to you, I can use the hot plate with peace of mind.

379
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
So let's eat together.

380
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,440
Oh, you're open-minded.

381
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Hey, you're popular.

382
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,440
A natural talent.

383
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm sorry.

397
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm sorry.

398
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I'm sorry.

399
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
You surprised me.

401
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
A hand roll.

402
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Sounds delicious.

403
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,440
The End

404
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,440
I wonder if I should wash my clothes.

405
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Sakurako!

406
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
It doesn't stink!

407
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
I just washed my clothes!

408
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Cat's eyes are so smelly that they smell like pheromones.

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
I see.

410
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Does it stink?

411
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
It doesn't stink!
