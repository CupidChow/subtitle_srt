00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's over!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now I can get free from the recording part!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Nico Nico! Nico Nico! Nico Nico, thank you!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, this.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I think I got something.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That thing from last time was a problem.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't get the result, but they asked me to avoid the budget.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So they stopped the budget.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm working on it now.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If it's too much, I'll personally help you.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Help me?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're just getting old.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I-I'm fine.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Really? I'm so sorry.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll have to work on the recording part again.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The End

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, I'll start the night shift.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You all know this, right?

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is a damn lazy activity.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I've been doing this all day long.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
By using you as a servant and making you work hard,

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll lower the number of people in the city and ask for forgiveness.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Please wish for the city's goodwill with justice.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I thought I could run away this year.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, in the first place...

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The End

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The chief is the one who's making me do this.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh no, the steel can's been crushed vertically.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's amazing.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're good, Pro-Machan!

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's crushed with a stick.

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to be crushed.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to be crushed!

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So it's muscle, after all.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is this a hidden secret?

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's wrong with him?

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's so weak, he's got that belly!

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And he's got a robot.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to accept it!

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I see.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're using your steel can with your bare hands.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My weight is 60kg.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Using your principle, I'll consider the position of the point of view and the point of power.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
About 120kg?

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're amazing, Teko!

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So you want that kind of power like a gorilla?

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Was a gorilla 500kg?

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Gorillas are amazing!

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I guess you could say I'm a thin Macho.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'd like to break my abs at least.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can break them yourself.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But I'm tired from working out.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're not breaking your abs yourself?

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop it!

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're going to say I did something wrong.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I know you're being selfish.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But...

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Chief,

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
don't you have any tools to solve this complex?

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You're advertising on the internet and TV.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You're just going to leave it on and it'll be muscle.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This EMS will be muscle, right?

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Does it work?

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He's saying he's going to lose weight.

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Lose weight?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're getting a bit too much, Umiyashiki.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a muscle contraction caused by electricity.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When you're in a low-voltage state,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
your whole body muscles contract.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Electricity affects muscles.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's try it first.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have a whole body.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now you know how humanity is disappointed in not exercising.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why me?

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You looked interested.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Put your shoes on.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to use your bare feet to keep the electricity from going out.

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Kukuku...

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't bite me!

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tsurumi's watching!

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The smell of cat's favorite.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's nice.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Switch on.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
My feet are moving on their own.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Muscles move by the electric signals from the brain.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to treat you like a frog.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Electricity moves when you're dead.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Does it hurt?

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It hurts, but it feels weird to see my feet moving on their own.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's okay if it doesn't hurt.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
By the way, the current level is...

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's about 0.5 milliamps.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
1 milliamps is enough to feel the heat.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
5 milliamps is not enough.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
6 milliamps for women.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
9 milliamps for men.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's unbearable.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It seems that you're using a current of less than 0.2 milliamps.

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a low frequency of 20Hz.

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please say it in Japanese.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's 20 seconds to contract muscles.

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
20 seconds?

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The voltage is 200 volts or so.

111
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If it goes any further, it's a stun gun.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sir!

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The reason the stun gun stops the enemy's movement is because the electricity is affecting the muscles.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In fact, the electricity is affecting the human body is used in the medical field.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's an AED used to help people who are seriously ill.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's used in the rehabilitation of muscles that can't be moved by bone or disease, and it's also used in the body.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My grandmother said she used it in the rehabilitation of plastic surgery.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Sakurako is relieved.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Even on the moon, this machine was actually introduced.

120
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Actually?

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But some of the members of the family...

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's an AED that has strengthened the clone of the excellent body to the limit.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There are no pieces of intelligence or spirituality.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's just right for the Earth.

125
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's good to be strong.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, EMS is forced to move muscles with electricity and do muscle training.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you understand the mechanism?

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes!

129
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can I borrow this?

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Me too!

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do as you please!

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's pretty late!

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now I'm going to wait for the broadcast of my admiration!

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you for the other day.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Will you eat this?

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's okay.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, yes.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's so big.

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, I'll eat it.

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's so ticklish.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I can lose weight with this.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What?

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's usually about 70,000 yen for an electric table.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I told you to erase it after you finished using it.

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, Sakurako, I don't know.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The law that makes it cheaper to put it on.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What?

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's often said that air conditioning is the most powerful power consumption at the time of start-up.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And it's also very heavy for home appliances.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's better to leave it on rather than putting it on and off frequently.

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But the parts will deteriorate, so it's a little too much.

154
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The refrigerator that I've been using for a long time is likely to break after it's out of power.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's because the deteriorated parts can't withstand the load at the time of restart.

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's what the director said, but the water is so dirty.

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No, no.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Because the water should be flowing.

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's so dirty and delicious.

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's cute.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, no.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mom, you should definitely wash the water.

164
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's so cute.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll just wash it.

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can't help it.

167
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll do something about the water tank.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm going back to work at night, Mune.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't say that in a weird way.

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Am I being too naive?

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Did grandma say that?

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Grandpa is the kind of person who does only what he wants to do.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Even if I want to travel to eat delicious food all over the country,

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
he doesn't take me at all for the reason that he's worried about the field.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So I came to my head.

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I decided to eat delicious food from all over the country with this person.

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I bought some food from him.

178
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I bought some food from him.

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I bought some food from him.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then...

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He said, if it's my money, let me eat it.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In short, if the other person doesn't change, it's easier for the others to change.

183
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
All right.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

186
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm done!

187
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm done!

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I left the door open a little when I used it.

189
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Next, I'm going to the water pipe.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I see.

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The mechanism of the toilet tank.

192
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
1. When you twist the cork,

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
2. The toilet is opened and water flows out.

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The toilet is opened with force.

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
3. The toilet closes with the water level drop.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
4. After the toilet closes, the water level drops and the water pipe opens and water flows in.

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
5. Finally, the water level rises and the water level drops.

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's coming out!

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it stopped!

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It looks like a toilet.

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the space is dead.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Normally, it's a push-type current or a touchless water pipe.

203
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If I use the foot switch to save electricity on the electric blanket of the mama...

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's warm when I get on the TV.

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The TV's switch...

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll use the foot switch again.

207
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can't move while watching TV.

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If it's a part of the microwave, there should be a lot of stuff.

209
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The core of the microwave timer.

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
When I made the microwave timer, I thought of making it a part because there was a bicycle shop nearby.

211
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll split the extension cord in half.

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll peel off the film.

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's fun to see that there's an analog part inside the house.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's gone automatically!

215
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I won't forget it!

216
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're good, Sakura!

217
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's the worst if it looks like me.

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This system is like turning off a power outlet, so it won't do any mistakes during recording and updating, so be careful!

219
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,000
I see.

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's right.

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Electricity is convenient, easy to use, safe, and easy to use.

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,700
High-power, low-efficiency, anyone can use it.

223
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,700
It's a kind of kindness that's designed to be used.

224
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,700
So, as a result of the changes in the surroundings...

225
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,500
Sakurako, drink bar, I'll take your place.

226
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,500
Okay.

227
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,700
I don't like the churu.

228
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
I'll buy it for lunch.

229
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,700
Huh?

230
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,500
What? Tsurumi, you're so high-temperature!

231
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,900
Compared to the cost of putting up a fence so that our cat can get out on the balcony,

232
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,900
or putting up a wall to keep it from getting stuck anywhere,

233
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,100
it's not that...

234
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,700
Isn't that a body?

235
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,000
Isn't it better to have a cat than a human?

236
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,400
But he's becoming more and more selfish.

237
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,000
He's being too naive!

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,200
He's going too far!

239
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
That's right! That's right!

240
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,600
He's so cute.

241
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,000
He's becoming more and more selfish, the more convenient he gets.

242
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,600
Tsuru, you should go home after you buy it.

243
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,300
But, no matter how selfish he is, if you look at his face,

244
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,400
he'll throw away everything.

245
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, by the way, did Grandma say that?

246
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm saying that it's not that special, but that's true.

247
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,300
Oh, is that so?

248
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,200
Then, please give it to me without eating it all.

249
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,500
Oh, I won't eat it anymore.

250
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,000
I knew it. The food you make is the best.

251
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Yes, yes. I know.

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
Seriously.

253
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,600
In the end, the one who falls in love loses.

254
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Sakurago Churu!

255
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Oh, I only have one.

256
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,200
I'll increase my part-time job.

257
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,900
No, it's amazing.

258
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,900
I can change that much in my life.

259
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I'll try to work harder for EMS.

260
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,700
How is it?

261
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Because of my muscles, I gained weight,

262
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
but my body is tight.

263
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,200
Hmm, No. 6.

264
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,600
How should I put it?

265
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,000
You look like a slightly muscular devil.

266
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,400
The mob became a devil!

267
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Hey!

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
But, what?

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I worked hard every day for EMS.

270
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

271
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,700
I've been training high-protein foods to recover muscles.

272
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,300
I've been training more and more.

273
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm here.

274
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,400
I've been working on protein subs,

275
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,600
and I've won the Omond to ease my hunger.

276
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,300
I've been sacrificing everything for this month to get to EMS.

277
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,600
I'm so happy.

278
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,100
But, after EMS, you feel a sense of accomplishment.

279
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah, yeah, I'm done!

280
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:56,200
So, you were going to lose weight just by training your muscles.

281
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No?

283
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,800
Muscle training is about making an engine.

284
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,400
It's about making a high-power engine that consumes a lot of energy,

285
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,600
and consuming more calories in your daily life.

286
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,900
You were relying on EMS without consuming too much calories.

287
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,400
You only increased the engine and continued to absorb energy.

288
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,300
That's what happens.

289
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,500
But, but...

290
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,300
EMS is not a tool to ease your hunger.

291
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,900
It's a tool to help you lose weight.

292
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
But...

293
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,700
Listen, if you want to change something,

294
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
you should change first.

295
00:20:46,300 --> 00:21:06,800
The silent

296
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,000
You're not fat at all, Rokugou-kun.

297
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
But, but...

298
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
It's okay, it's okay.

299
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,100
You have a lot of muscle.

300
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,100
In fact, this belly meat is like a dumbbell.

301
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,900
It's like a good muscle training.

302
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
It's a wonderful meat.

303
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,600
So she was the calorie sponsor.

304
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Change is a relative thing from one's personal perspective.

305
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,600
What's that?

306
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,800
It means that Mob has become a dev and is in love with dev.

307
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
That's how you say it.

308
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,900
But, if you're in love, it can't be helped.

309
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,400
People's hearts are not logic.

310
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,300
Make a Rumor

311
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,100
We'll get separated

312
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,900
And I won't talk to you

313
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,400
I want to be with you

314
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,900
But I don't have enough time

315
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,900
Let's go somewhere without people

316
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,900
If only we could have a break

317
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,900
What a wonderful day

318
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,900
I'm living with all my strength

319
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,900
I've given up everything

320
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,900
Because you forget me

321
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,900
By then, I can go see you

322
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm living with all my strength

323
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
While Sakurako was sleeping, I was eating a churu

324
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I thought you were fat recently, but that's what happened

325
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Sakurako, when did you...

326
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Oh, by the way, you like electricity to lose weight, right?

327
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,900
Sorry! I'll just put the sand in my hand for now!
