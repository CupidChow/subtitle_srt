1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,100
To forgive the world

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,260
Amazing

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,720
In this narrow and dark town

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,980
A street with no lights

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,800
C 같이

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,640
No one shows their streams

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,600
The street runs through the 식ive

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,840
Lovely

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,340
Hey Santa

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,940
Come in

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow! Senpai, you're like a pro at returning the favor!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No, not really.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I said it was amazing!

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I wonder if it is.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I didn't say a word at the university today.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Akihiro, I sang too much that my throat is dry.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Umeyashiki-san, I'm sorry I said too much the other day.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going back to karaoke.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was so exciting that I should have invited you.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm working right now.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't hear you.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Here.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I'm working at this hour.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hey, Akihiro, let's go to the dark side because the power is out.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll walk home.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Surumi-kun, did you say you had a cat?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wonder what kind of cat it is.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know what's right for your star.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't live for you.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm excited about new things.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's get started.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How lonely would you feel when the star explodes?

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I wonder.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I heard a gentle voice from the other side of the bright night sky.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I wonder.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't live for you.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm excited about new things.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's get started.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Teens in Hell

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's getting sucked in.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
His name is Moo Moo.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's a mole who just came out of the sky.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The wind is so soft!

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And this sound, this vibration...

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a pretty good invention, Muu.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've seen a bit of the Earthlings again, Muu.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If the space-bearing technology is being used in the microwave,

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
if you understand it, you'll be able to get closer to the technology in a flash!

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Muu, Muu.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Huh?

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Muu, Muu.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Huh?

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you want to know how to use the vacuum cleaner?

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Not really.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I see.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Actually, instead of this paper-packed vacuum cleaner,

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want a new one with a cyclone-type.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Cyclone?!

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
C-Cyclone means that the suction power doesn't change!

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right!

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That cyclone that the TV said was sucking up 500 yen!

83
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right! That cyclone!

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your room is so dirty that you need the power to suck up the effect of the metal!

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's like promoting that I can't clean, Sakurako!

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The one who tries to fix the low power of his own with gadgets is the most foolish, Muu.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But...

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's so messy at that level, so I can't help it.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop it, Muu!

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're taking away Muu's freedom, Muu!

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry, Muu.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry, Muu.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're surprisingly violent, Muu.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Shut up!

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't worry, Muu!

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If it's a hole in this wall, it's a year later.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
With the technology of Muu and his team, you'll be able to make tea, Muu!

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Eh? A year?

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, you didn't say that.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Muu and his team's technology regeneration plan has a limit of one year on Earth.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A limit?

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Muu and his team lost their life in the war and moved to the remaining colonies.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, I heard that before.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Muu has seen the destruction of the enemy planet several times.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But when the life was gone, his tears didn't stop, Muu.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But Muu and his team lost their life in the war and moved to the remaining colonies.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They realized that they could only maintain the colonies for a year.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In other words, Muu's team is destined to have a million followers.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why?

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If they fail, their followers will have a million followers.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A million followers?

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They're attacking Earth, Muu.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Eh? A million?

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm so pissed off, Muu.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What did we learn from that war?

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A civilization that can create a spaceship that goes beyond the galaxy.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A technology to hide a ship stuck in an apartment.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
A technology to hide a ship stuck in an apartment.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can understand that it's ridiculous.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But do I have to do something about it?

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This child...

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
...has knowledge?

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sakurako.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I knew it. That vacuum cleaner.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Especially Cyclone.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You can teach it to Muu.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Y-Yes, that's right.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But I think we should start with the paper pack system.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Paper pack?

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't talk about this.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sakurako, can I do that?

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Can you fix it later?

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Leave it to me, Muu!

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ah! The paper pack! I'm going to throw it away!

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Best roll!

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, the garbage!

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I see.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is the vacuum cleaner.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Most of the structure is made of a fan that is directly connected to the motor.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's almost like a machine that makes the wind.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And the reel.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What do you think the red tape and the yellow tape on this cord are?

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The red cord is the end.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The yellow cord is the end.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The red cord is the end.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The red cord is the end.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The red cord is the end.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So the yellow cord is the end?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's what I think!

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The yellow cord is the line that you pull out and use when you use it.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Most of the vacuum cleaners have to use the cord to keep it from getting too hot.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can't use the cord to the yellow cord every time.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Y-Yes, Muu.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And the key is the structure, but the easy-to-understand is on this page.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This page?

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, no!

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The inside of the vacuum cleaner is like a water recorder.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
As Muu said, most of the vacuum cleaners are just machines that make the wind.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The water flow is just a stream.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Good!

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's like you're going to filter the dirt that's sucked into the stream with a paper pack.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's like you're going to make a house dust.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The function of house dust and pollen is based on the details of the filter and paper pack.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But if you have too many details, it's hard to get the suction power.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I see.

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's what it says on this page, Muu.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I see.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I can't tell you anything.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you doing, Sakurako?

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can't read what it says on the page.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You have to understand it by comparing it with reality.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Help me, Muu.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I guess I have no choice.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The inside of the vacuum cleaner is just a paper pack.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
As Muu said, most of the vacuum cleaners are just machines that make the wind.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The inside of the vacuum cleaner is like a water recorder.

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The inside of the vacuum cleaner is just a paper pack.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So the wind from the vacuum cleaner that you played with just now was removed by the filter of dust and dust.

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But it's more delicate than that.

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The pollen and dust are just fine.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It seems that a considerable amount of filters are needed to remove bacteria and viruses.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's what the air purifier uses.

184
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Like a HEPA filter.

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
When it comes to bacteria and viruses, the eyes are fine.

186
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So you have to dig a few meters to block the wind.

187
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It seems that only bacteria comes out of that duct.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Muu! Muu!

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What happened?

190
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The threat of Muu and the others on this unknown planet is neither a weapon nor a strategy.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It is a recently discovered, dust-like microorganism that has existed since the era of the atomic bomb.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Muu Muu.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The earth's key to the wells is too dangerous!

194
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Isn't it something that comes after investigating?

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I thought I was going to die.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Please be careful.

197
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Muu Muu can't be seen by the doctor.

198
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you, Sakurako.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The future of the comrades has been opened.

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If I had more knowledge of the home appliances, I could have taught Muu Muu a lot.

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ah.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, I will take your leave before I send it to the student staff to collect the home appliances and supplies.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ah, it may be revived by repair.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Rewards are paid at a low price and at a low price.

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The Institute of Education, the Cultural Association, the Humanity Re-reporting Research Association.

206
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is it!

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you can repair the appliances and teach me the mechanism, I will be able to get a good reward!

208
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The End

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Anyway, what kind of circle is the Humanity Re-reporting Research Association?

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Sakurako, help me!

211
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm stuck in a trap!

212
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm going to die!

213
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Muu Muu, stop it!

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What?

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm stuck in a place like this.

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's all a circle of the Cultural Association.

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll leave it on the bridge for now.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
As expected of the National Highest Research Institute, you are very ambitious, Muu Muu!

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't stand there!

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I know it even if I don't hide it!

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The University Research Institute is the most innovative institute in which the government and companies work together.

222
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm excited, Muu Muu!

223
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't say that it's the Cultural Association now.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You!

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
New students? Circle visit?

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, guitarist, get out of here!

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Please visit the Library!

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Um...

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Our karaoke research club is going to invite a person like you!

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A person like me?

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't call me that!

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You're going to get your ass kicked!

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey, good job!

234
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I won't say it clearly.

235
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm no good.

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I can't raise my face just because of this.

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I can only see my feet.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you doing?

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hurry up and go!

240
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Um...

241
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry, but where is the Humanity Research Club?

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I heard it...

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I heard it...

244
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There...

245
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm going to blow up!

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Damn it!

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My beard! Muu's beard!

248
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is he okay?

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Rokuro, do you usually put gasoline in your fan hater?

250
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, why would I put gasoline in my fan hater?

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Kadenya, our gasoline is rotten!

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You guys are going to crush this circle with the boy you were with the other day?

253
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Crush it?

254
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's not what I meant...

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Black color chemical, nitroglycerin, nuclear explosion.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
As you know, the history of science is the history of explosion.

257
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What is civilization without explosion?

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Civilization?

259
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Please, let me go!

260
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There he is, the cheap guy.

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Hey, doesn't he look like a customer?

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

263
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What is he?

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm in trouble, please forgive me!

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He's the one who did the worst to that boy.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Did that happen?

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Sonoko, let's go.

268
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay.

269
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you okay?

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes.

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hey, Tenkuubashi, it looks like you guys have something to do with that boy.

272
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What? To our house?

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What is it?

274
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
U-Um...

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Wow! I've never seen anyone who disassembled and brought it here!

276
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's not true!

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sorry, but this is...

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No, it's not.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There's no fault in disassembling it this much.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What? You're kidding!

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Look at that.

282
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's the part of the handle. It's clean.

283
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, you're right.

284
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This part is also clean. The screw holes are clean.

285
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I see. It looks like a beam, so it's broken.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I hope he doesn't find out about Mumu.

287
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Wow, I wonder how he did it.

288
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is bad.

289
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I should run away now.

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I see.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

292
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This will help Mumu.

293
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please put me in this circle!

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, nice to meet you!

295
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You! I don't know about the repair department of the club and the inn.

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What?

297
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Please stop, club leader.

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Wow, so you're the second new student this year.

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And you two brought a cat with you.

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What?

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What? Is it popular?

302
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A cat?

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you tell me about it...

304
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Hey, Tsurumi!

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You're my classmate!

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Help me clean the club room later.

307
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Tsurumi!

308
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Tsurumi?

309
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why?

310
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What should I do?

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You're cute today.

312
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, right.

313
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll give you something nice.

314
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It looks like you don't like something I have.

315
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Chaochuru.

316
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I did it! I did it!

317
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sakurako won't buy this at all!

318
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

320
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No, I didn't mind.

321
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're so stupid!

322
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
By the way, Tsurumi, where's your cat?

323
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Huh?

324
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
She was here just now.

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Mumu.

326
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why are you getting used to that kind of family, Maru?

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll kill you...

328
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
...as you wish.

329
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Under the sky

330
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
While swaying with the buds

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The stray dog is trying to get into my bones

332
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Trying out the power of the wild

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The moon falls on the back of the alley

334
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The dog's eyeball is square

335
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Today, humanity has arrived at the stars for the first time

336
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The day when Pitecan tropes will come is near

337
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Today, humanity has arrived at the stars for the first time

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The day when Pitecan tropes will come is near

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's going to be spring

340
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's going to be spring

341
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The cord of the vacuum cleaner is wrapped around the button.

342
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It feels good when it's fixed in one go.

343
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The cord is tangled.

344
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
One more time.

345
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Isn't it a waste of time to pull it out again and again?

346
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But I want to fix it in one go!
