Episode 2

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,360
So this is where the Serval Cat came in.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm scared.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,920
The Gailite is scary.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Tenkuu Bridge, you're back in the hospital.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I'm glad I made it.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,840
Am I really allowed to stay here?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll recommend a new school right now.

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're right.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, well, Shiberia.

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Calm down.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Sakurako-chan, you shouldn't apologize.

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In this case, did you do anything bad to the chiefs?

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I guess I have to move out of college.

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then I have to quit the circle.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, what do you think, Mumu?

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look at this, Sakurako!

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's like a tank!

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll give you a treat, too!

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey!

82
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you know that the place was designated by the chiefs for this case?

83
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm going to run away, Senpai!

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not really angry.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The case of the huge unidentified flying object.

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's an occult CG, so no one believes it.

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But the top of the country is different.

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The data from the Self-Defense Force is very strange.

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A daily meeting was held to gather the experts to take measures as soon as possible.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The current plan is to cooperate with the Foreign Minister and JAKUSA to measure the contact.

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's a big deal.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But it's a troublesome case to have contact with the Intelligence Life Force.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can't stand being thrown around in our country with such an impulsive attitude.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was an attack on you, the victims of the coup.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sakurako-kun, we are responsible for everything this time.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't expect them to take such a big step.

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I don't want you to worry.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can say that you and Moo Moo have the best results.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You showed the usefulness of the Earth's scientific power and made them retreat without causing any damage.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey!

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Anamori, you know that, don't you?

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, I don't know, Anamori.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I had a warning, but I'm going to put Sakurako-sensei in danger.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hey! Don't get on Anamori!

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sakurako, Moo doesn't like moving.

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, she's got a rocket in her mouth.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's true. It's dangerous for Sakurako-sensei to be separated from Maru.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wow, you're right.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But what did you do when the incident happened?

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You said that you succeeded in the campaign to the administration of the Infra-Tantou.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then you should have known about this earlier.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Huh?

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dejimaru-kun's house is...

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Dejimaru tried to contact the Minister of Public Transport and Transport,

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and he was attracted to the Minister's son,

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so he was brought to the dormitory as it is.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then, the Minister's son is...

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He was here!

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was so worried!

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Surumi-kun!

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You were with him?

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah. Did you come to look for him?

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But how did you find this place?

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I saw him at the dormitory.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hey, senpai!

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm glad I found you.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I brought Sakurako-kun here because he said he knew a cat.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Who is that?

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Oh, it's my uncle, Anamori.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's my dad! It's my dad! It's my dad!

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dad? He's young.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, he's my dad's younger brother, my uncle, Anamori.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He said he was in Tokyo, so I came to see him.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I-It's true!

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There's nothing wrong with him!

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Something wrong?

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Dad-katsu?

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, it's not that!

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What? You're being hasty.

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's dad-katsu after all!

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should I do?

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's kind of weird.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Huh?

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Surumi-kun, are you angry?

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why?

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you angry? Why?

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't tell me you're worried about me.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I know.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Excuse me. Where can I buy that cat's ride?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Huh? A cat's ride?

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes. I really want one at home.

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I see. He's the machine's owner.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's the holder for Decimal-kun.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Um, is he a robot cleaner?

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A cleaner?

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Excuse me.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That cat's ride is cute, isn't it?

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Um, if it's a robot cleaner, it should have a stock in the club room.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Really?

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll ask the manager later.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It went down.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It stopped again.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's tangled up again.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I asked if it was good for the environment where the pets are.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not like it's tangled up.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What's the difference?

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is the one the manager repaired before.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's not good.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Excuse me.

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes?

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The cleaning machine and the brush are the problem.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The brush?

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There are many types of robot cleaners.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
One type is a normal brush, and the other is a single brush.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I see.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I recommend a rubber double brush for pets.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What?

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't take my move!

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's okay. I'll do it.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If the robot cleaner does the mop work...

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you know?

186
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There are also robot cleaners that can wipe the water at times like this.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's convenient.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
By the way, if it's a water tank type, it won't get dust or pollen, so it's safe.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll sell it to the newbies.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I see.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry I spilled it.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's okay.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know a lot about home appliances.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you for teaching me a lot.

195
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
See you later.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, right.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You don't have to move.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You and Mumu have to continue studying.

199
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's better to be in the circle for that reason.

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Am I really allowed to be in that circle?

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Umiyashiki-san, phone call.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Me?

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, Umiyashiki. It's me, Tenkuu Bashi.

206
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Director, I'm on my way to the hospital.

207
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're fine, but you're in a very hot situation.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Can you just go with me to Tsurumi?

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was just being told to clean the robot cleaner in the room,

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
but I'm going to be messed up by the machine sound of that hand and be messed up.

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're the only one who's going to laugh.

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Can you do me a favor, Umiyashiki?

213
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Um, Director, I'm not in the circle anymore.

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Director, Miss Campus, Smile Komachi is here again.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What?

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm coming, Umiyashiki.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's cut off.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This?

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's hurry before the club closes.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, sorry.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You bastard.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're doing it on your own?

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're hurting your hand.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mom, I don't want to quit the circle.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So, there's no need to quit.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They know where we are anyway,

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
so it's fine to go anywhere in Japan when something happens.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're so knowledgeable, Kaden.

231
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thank you for teaching me so much.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're the only one who's here.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Can you do me a favor, Umiyashiki?

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Even I can help you.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait, Tsurumi!

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The End

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You must use a national-grade battery.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wait, I can use this one.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I bought this yesterday.

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's unreleased.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're thinking about Sakurako.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can only try this once in my life.

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know best that you're the one who's waiting for help.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why did Mumu and I end up like this?

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That day, I was cornered by Mumu.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I entered the competition with a record of 2 times.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The result...

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I lost.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There's only one adult girl among the kids.

251
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
She doesn't even have a date on her day off.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Boo, boo.

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
She's a little kid.

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why am I so...

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And today, I came to ask the manager for a tune-up.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Umiyashiki.

257
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes?

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Do you understand the power of this?

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well...

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You know, right?

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a motor, it's electricity.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you don't think about the decoration, the answer will come out.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's like a long, distant light.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Umiyashiki, it's underground in the old building.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's an instant coffee next to the vending machine.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a Blue Man.

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's a Blue Man.

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll have one, too.

269
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
O-Okay.

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
As a token of gratitude, I'd like to ask you to buy the manager's maniac favorite.

271
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Suddenly, I was attacked by an earthquake.

272
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The underground that the old building's electric waves can't reach.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was trapped in the elevator.

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I'll have two cups of coffee.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But it's cold, it's a waste.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I can't help it.

279
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll have to sort out the situation again.

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The emergency phone is broken.

281
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The door only opens as much as the cat's forehead.

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What I have in my hand is a paper cup, a cell phone that can't reach the cell phone, a wallet, a mini car of Mu, and a summer sweater that Sakurako took off.

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, a loose chain.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
After all, the only way to get rid of it is to deliver the phone to the outside with this mini car and ask for help.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm so sorry for the summer sweater I bought in Shibuya.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can't change my stomach.

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Fortunately, this building was built during the bubble period.

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a building with a high sense of design and is ahead of its time and uses barrier-free.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If you let the spiral slope run on the wall, you can go to the first floor.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
In other words, the problem is only the battery.

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
A giant battery that runs a slope.

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's right!

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:16:00,940
I should use the national

294
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
battery.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a national-made battery.

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a battery from a 100 yen shop.

297
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a different quality from the one from the store.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's right.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And the manager said this.

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There are a large number of batteries, a full-fledged battery and an alkaline battery, but most of them are now alkaline batteries.

301
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you use a full-fledged battery for small power supply devices such as watches and telephones, you can put it in the laundry, but if it's a general use, you can choose an alkaline battery.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There is almost no doubt.

303
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But there are also weaknesses in alkaline batteries.

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's a leak.

305
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If the leak is bad, it will destroy the device.

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You need to be careful about that.

307
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The alkaline battery has a long-lasting power and is just right for those who move with the motor or for the strobe of the camera.

308
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's amazing.

309
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you know that, you're going to be a Sakurako.

310
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I thought I was fooled, so I challenged myself with a national alkaline battery.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I was surprised.

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What's the plan?

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What a bad university.

314
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But the whole school is full of dark spots.

315
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If only I was with Akihiro at a time like this.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Akihiro?

317
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Are you okay?

318
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Akihiro...

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Did he run to me because he was worried about me?

320
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh, I think I've got my feet twisted.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I see.

322
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This way.

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Akihiro hit me.

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And that's a great light spot.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This way?

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No, or this way?

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Akihiro, what are you looking for?

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Are you going to invite me to a more light spot?

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How bold.

330
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This way.

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The basement!

332
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In such a strong light spot?

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is good.

334
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll do my best.

335
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's go!

336
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wow, it's so powerful!

337
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm not going to lose to those annoying little kids!

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Go, go!

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm going to climb up to the first floor!

340
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's getting darker and darker.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You want me to do it today?

343
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Wait, I'm still not ready.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's okay.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No!

346
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Akihiro, you're going to fall in love with me!

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah!

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm finally going to climb up the stairs of an adult.

349
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is...

350
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Someone's pulling the string!

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Sakurako!

352
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Who is it?

353
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hello?

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sakurako, come closer!

355
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Who is it?

356
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to climb up the stairs of an adult.

357
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm going to climb up the stairs of an adult.

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Who is it?

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
No reaction.

360
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If you think about it,

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
when you climb up the spiral slope, the string gets caught in the wall

362
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and you can't hear the sound of the voice.

363
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's over.

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm at my limit.

366
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's okay, Mu.

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I wish I could do something Mu did in that corner.

368
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's not good!

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's okay.

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Tsurumi!

371
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Minika brought this with her.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
She was locked up.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hold on to it.

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Are you okay?

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry!

378
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What's this? A toilet?

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What the heck!

380
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I climbed up the stairs of an adult in just a little bit!

381
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Huh?

382
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're on your feet.

383
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ouch!

384
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There it is.

385
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I've been looking for it.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Go!

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Go! Go!

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Go, Mu!

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The national alkaline energy is amazing!

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's as strong as the cherry blossoms when you run into the toilet!

391
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What?

392
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We won!

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can't hear the sound!

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's a game of girls who don't have a date on a holiday!

395
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I lost to Mu!

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We did it, Mu!

397
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Today, humanity first arrived at the planet Jupiter.

398
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The day when it becomes Vitecanthropus is approaching.

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's becoming spring.

400
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's becoming spring.

401
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm glad you didn't lose it, Sakurako.

402
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If that's the case, I can't go to college anymore.

403
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If you're a cat-lover, you'd be mistaken for marking.

404
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What do you think of Tsurumi-kun?

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He's a disgusting guy who's over the cat-lover level.

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can't even say it back.
