00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 3

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My battery's almost dead.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kagetsu-san, I'll lend you my mobile battery anytime.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll look for a good one next time.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, good work.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Please take this.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's see... 70,000 yen.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
70,000 yen?!

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's a lot of money!

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's expensive!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why are you using it, Umeyashiki-san?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
70,000 yen for the electricity bill?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Seriously?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's amazing.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mom...

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Tokyo's electricity bill is...

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
very...

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
expensive.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The End

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What a cold-hearted woman.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is it.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm going to show you my savings.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you'll pay for it.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, sir.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm on a diet.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not that fat.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll pretend I don't see it.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're on a diet?

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's not good.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here, take whatever you want.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Eat as much as you want.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You'll get your body back for eating in return.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Tokyo...

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Is this a hand mixer?

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
As you know,

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we, the human research team,

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
have been doing a lot of work to recover the waste.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And we're repairing it,

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but sometimes we get a lot of requests from the school.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The remodeling of this hand mixer is also one of them.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Remodeling?

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What?

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You fixed the power plug the other day.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There should be no problem with that.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A cheap hand mixer.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Unfortunately, it's a weak power white thing that can make cappuccino milk,

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but to get a stronger torque,

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we replaced it with this powerful mini-car's hyper-dash motor.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're a monster!

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Where did you learn that kind of language?

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Insert the minus driver and unscrew it.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There are also screws hidden behind the seal, so be careful.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The structure itself is simple,

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
so you just have to remember the wiring around the motor.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Replace the gear with a wrench,

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and reattach it to the wiring with a soldering iron.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Put the cover back on and tighten it.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And it's done.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
See? It's easy.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can we use the soldering iron?

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Take ten of these.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're used to disassembling.

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Now, disassemble, disassemble,

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
disassemble the parts,

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and put them aside.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Go beyond all the failures you can.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's done.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But what is this?

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's obvious!

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The power supply.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mix the protein.

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A strong protein opponent like you

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
can't beat a normal person.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
T-Triple Ice?

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You can't mix it yourself.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You idiot!

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you mix it yourself,

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you'll get tired before you do the training.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm counting on you again.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You guys!

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't do anything more than that!

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You guys!

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't do anything more than that!

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, next is this.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Replace the tip with a rubber band.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is for the silver tape,

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sakurako Momoyashi.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Silver tape?

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Silver tape used for concerts and other performances.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We are receiving requests from such circles

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and receiving a price.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hello.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's go.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You'll get a reward for your hard work.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So this hand mixer is important.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a little modified.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Amazing, Muu.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Maybe this is a great invention, Muu.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, the great thing is the motor inside.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The mechanism for the power to be converted into power is the same.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The structure that converts power into electricity

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is the basis of many generators.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's wonderful.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Firepower, waterpower, windpower...

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Amazing.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If I change the things that I wrap in more,

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I might be able to make more money.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For example,

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
a rubber band for wrapping,

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
an asemichi sheet,

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and a band for wrapping.

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Grandma said that all of them are hard to use.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's like this.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I wonder if I can hold it down.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If I use a stronger motor,

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sure...

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hey.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Huh?

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Muu?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hey, Muu!

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're going to get caught!

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why do you think my driver is so long?

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No one wants to be underestimated by the delicate zone.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm only looking at the machine with all my might, so I'm safe.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This one is 30,000 gravity.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it going to be okay?

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I know, Muu.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is probably a machine that generates super-vibration.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
On Muu's planet,

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
they used a stronger motor for that purpose.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wait a minute, Muu.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Huh? What are you doing?

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Where did that come from?

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The energy is collected at the center of this triangle.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Wow! What kind of mechanism is that?

140
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If I knew that, I wouldn't have come to this planet.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I did it, Muu! I'm full of energy!

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm done, Muu!

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The battery is full.

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Here I go, Muu.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is the great Muu's planet...

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm so sorry.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was so close to getting a heart attack.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey, hey.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The melted plastic is stuck between the eyeball and the eyelid.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Cats often have that happen to their eyeballs.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not an eyeball, it's a plastic.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You pervert!

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I have something that I sucked,

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and I'm returning it with my body.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
One, two...

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's right.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're not holding it with your arms, you're holding it with your hips.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Akihiro, you're so bad at this.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hmph.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
At a military weapon development agency,

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the microwave was developed by accident during the research of the radar.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The microwave wave emitted from the magnetron

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and the chocolate in the pocket was heated and melted.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The microwave was made by accident.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
People talk about this episode when they're lucky.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But I remember the horror.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Tenkuubashi, you said it was quiet in the library.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Because if the one who met the luck of God,

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
who was completely useless in science,

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the chocolate was heated in my hips and melted into the chocolate.

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And then, the stupid understanding ended.

172
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was decades after the microwave was released.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The enemy of science is...

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Die! So be quiet!

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No matter what miracle or good luck,

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
if there is no scientific

177
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,000
and scientific basis to accept it,

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it's nothing but garbage.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So, this Tenkuubashi will be disassembled by the power.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
By disassembling it, we can understand things in a multi-dimensional way.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We must not let good luck take over everything.

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So that's the reason.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Get out!

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a good idea to go to the library to get your feet stung.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Sorry for asking you to help.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No problem.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's nice and dark here.

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What's that girl?

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She's been caught by a man other than Akihiro.

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Could it be that she's...

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Princess Otasawa!

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't be so happy.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Remember that.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm just seeking a miracle that overflows in this world.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's all.

197
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm running out of battery.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I told you to buy my mobile battery anytime.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I want to find a good one.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey!

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's go.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're just about done with class.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Huh?

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Could this be...

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, no, no, no, no.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Look at this room.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:47,960
The headmaster only cares about the

210
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
mobile phone charging system.

211
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's too much.

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's just a mobile phone's wireless charging application.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're kidding me!

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I thought you were saying that a white thing that can only be charged a few centimeters away is long-distance.

215
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No, it's not.

216
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, the power system itself uses the wireless charging.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
To put it simply,

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the mobile phone that supports wireless charging is filled with a charging coil.

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The magnetic field generated by the charging coil hits the charging coil and is charged.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, so this big thing is the charging coil that generates the magnetic field.

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You fool!

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You fool!

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Try making a magnetic field that's several meters away.

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
All the metals will react and I'll die.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This machine is an electromagnetic wave generator.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's a hassle, but I'll use this special smartphone case.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This smartphone case is equipped with a charging coil that is the same as a charger.

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
By applying the electromagnetic wave generated by the bubble to this coil,

229
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the electric current is created in the receiving coil, which is built into the phone's body, and charged.

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
See? It's just as usual.

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I found a mobile phone that I'm curious about in the library.

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
A woman...

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, you guys.

234
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If you don't get bothered by the battery of your mobile phone,

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
what kind of face do you think she'll make?

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's that person. The person the chief was looking at.

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is she in love? Is she in love?

238
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Her nose is slightly extended.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Um...

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So, in other words, her smartphone...

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What about the smartphone case?

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, I already bought the same type of phone and got the charging coil installed.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A charger...

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Why did you do that? I knew it!

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What a cruel expression of love!

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Turn on the switch.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Where's the breaker?

248
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I pulled it from the engineering department's lab.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That breaker won't fall.

250
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Keep it as straight as possible.

251
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Um...

252
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's 47 meters to the smartphone.

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
All right.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The electric wave has nothing to do with gravity or wind.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It doesn't matter how far it is.

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Here goes.

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Three, two, one...

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Fire!

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The water exploded!

261
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey!

262
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's weird.

263
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's weird.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Did someone mess up the frequency?

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The focus was off, too.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey, second shot.

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Move your angle a little...

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why do you think there's a second time?

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Sakurako, Akiro, Rope, close it!

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I remember.

271
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, it's her.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Do you know her?

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

274
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
She won the Miss Con prize last year.

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Miss Con?

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Koto Hohoemi Komachi and Sonoko Kagetsu.

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We were hired by the Miss Con to participate in the event.

278
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The battery is running out.

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm borrowing my mobile battery.

280
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll look into a good mobile battery.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hey!

282
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Are you having trouble with your smartphone's battery?

283
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, in terms of gadgets,

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the USB terminal is the male,

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and the female is the one who's stuck in the main body.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, what are you talking about?

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Shut up.

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm talking about why the cable side is the male,

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but the shape of the cable is easy to break.

290
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The male is the one who's stuck in the female.

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
On the other hand, your female seems to be using it a lot.

292
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How many male cables are you using now?

293
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I know.

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's a sudden and shocking story.

295
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought the chief was doing something at the time.

296
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But...

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I heard that she saw the place where her face was drawn.

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's only that time, after that and before that.

299
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hey!

300
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've been thinking about it since this time.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think the chief has been thinking about the remote charging for her since then.

302
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, chief.

303
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ah! She's running away!

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh no, oh no!

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Let's find her, Akirou!

307
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Huh? Yes.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You're having trouble with your battery.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I have a technique to overcome that.

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's what you call a stone-less, right?

311
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's hot!

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What? The computer fell?

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's out of power.

314
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's getting dark.

315
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Akirou?

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Akirou!

317
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
All the doors are out of power.

318
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
EMP?

319
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The infrastructure destruction caused by a super-powerful electronic pulse.

320
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's possible.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
An electronic pulse?

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why would anyone do that?

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hey, is this...

325
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Cyberterrorism?

326
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Hey, you saw the Sky Bridge, right?

327
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I did.

328
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Sky Bridge!

329
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's here!

330
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You bastard!

331
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Sky Bridge!

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You're back again with your circle-making!

333
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're running away!

334
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll kill you!

335
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Wait!

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's so embarrassing.

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've only charged 3% of my battery after all this.

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Idiot.

339
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Huh? What was that?

340
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The chocolate in your pocket was already melting.

341
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Huh? What do you mean?

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
To realize that miracle, the chief's love-hate relationship was too immature.

343
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Huh? What is it?

344
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Um, this is...

345
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Um, my chief is doing something wrong!

346
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Smile, Komachi!

347
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Wait!

348
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll kill you!

349
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You bastard!

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Nisan is exerting his carbon dioxide

351
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That child is breathing

352
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Under the sky with a dot pattern

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
While shaking with the buds still in place

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The dog is adding my bones

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Trying out the power of the wild

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The moon falls on the back of the alley

357
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The dog's eyeballs are square

358
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Today, humanity is the first

359
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And we've reached the stars

360
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The day we become Pitecan tropes

361
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Has come

362
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Today, humanity is the first

363
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And we've reached the stars

364
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The day we become Pitecan tropes

365
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Has come

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
We'll become Pitecan tropes

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We'll become Pitecan tropes

368
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
How much battery left in your phone will charge it?

369

When are you going to play Sakurako?

371
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I wonder if I'll play it until it's zero.

372
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Won't you be in trouble if the battery runs out?

373
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's okay. I don't have any friends who can contact me.

374
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What a sad answer.
