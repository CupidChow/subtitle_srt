00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,440
I bought

8
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,570
delicious osmanthus cakes for you.

9
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,620
I don't have time to eat them.

10
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm really busy today.

11
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,940
Don't bother me.

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,590
Go on with your work.

13
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,600
Eat after you finish your work.

14
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,280
Think about me while eating.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,840
Well...

00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,610
Let me... Let me help you.

00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,000
Go away.

00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,280

It... It really hurts.

22
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,190
I'll give you

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,940
some medicine to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis.

24
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,070
No need.

25
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,060
It would be a waste if you use the medicine on me.

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,980
Just give me a hug.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,550
Okay.

No one is here. Hug me properly.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,640
Okay. Give you a hug.

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,920

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,840
But the names

42
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,870
don't sound nice.

43
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,190
Why are you angry?

44
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,829
Look at this dish.

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,070
It has chrysanthemums.

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,740
It's called "chrysanthemum picking by the eastern fence".

This is called

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,600
"spring bamboo shoots breaking through the wall".

You threw something at His Majesty, who was on a secret trip,

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,980
and asked him to get out?

66
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,560
You don't need to talk so loud.

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,690

You threw something at His Majesty, who was on a secret trip,

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,110
and asked him to get out?

70

through the imperial banquet,

76
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,600
I can make Medicated Diet Restaurant more successful.

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,390
I'll open a branch in the capital first.

78
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,150
Then I'll expand the presence all over the country.

79
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,770
The guests of the birthday banquet are noble.

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Their relationships are very complicated.

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,680
Why does His Majesty want to have a banquet at Medicated Diet Restaurant?

82
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,880
Ordinary people can eat what we make.

83
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,310
Why can't noble people in the imperial palace eat them?

84
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,880
Even if something happens,

85
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,140
it'll be noble people's business.

86
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,910
Qin has a point.

87
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,120
General Yun,

88
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,270
don't worry about me.

89
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,630
You have your own business.

90
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,730
His Majesty asked you

91
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,950
and your wife to attend the banquet together.

92
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:32,950
You...

93
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,020
If it's inconvenient for you,

94
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,590
just stay at home.

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,580
I'll tell His Majesty the truth.

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,830
It's not inconvenient.

97
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,070
I'll go with you.

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,790
Chonglou,

99
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,180
my sister doesn't know the rules in the imperial palace.

100
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,560
Please take care

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,909
of the food for the banquet.

102
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,550
You're willing to go with me?

103
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,800
No matter it's a good thing or a bad thing,

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,030
we can avoid it.

105
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,440
I'll go with you.

106
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,070
Since you're here,

107
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,210
there's no need to be restrained.

108
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,320
Just take it as an ordinary family banquet.

109
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,270
Come on.

110
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,800

111
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,350
why do you and your wife

112
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,810
look

113
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,430
so unfamiliar today?

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,490
Enough.

115
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,630
I'm just chatting with you.

116
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,500
You don't need to kneel.

117
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,230
Just stand there.

118
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,350
Your Majesty,

119
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,909
my wife

120
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,480
thinks

121
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,750
I'm too talkative.

122
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,409
I made a bet with her.

123
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,160
Whoever speaks first

124
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,750
will lose.

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,820
I spoke just now.

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,870
I lost.

127
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,910
But

128
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,310
I heard

129
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,860
since Ms. Mo went to the government office

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
to try to divorce you,

131
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,860
the marital affection

132
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,320
between you two has disappeared.

133
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,950
And you divorced long ago.

134
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,510
Your Majesty,

135
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,070
rumors can't be trusted.

136
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,750
Think carefully before you speak.

137
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,550
The...

138
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,230
The food...

139
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,260
Your Majesty. Your...

140

The food...

141
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,380
Call an imperial physician!

142
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,050
Call an imperial physician now!

143
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,909
Your Majesty.

144
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,490
This is the lotus seed soup with red dates and water chestnuts.

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,710
This is the last dessert today.

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,270
After His Majesty finishes the tea,

147
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,880
we'll serve this.

148
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,590
Okay.

Qin Chonglou, the boss of Mo Comes Again,

150
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,930
poisoned His Majesty at the banquet.

151
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,200
His Majesty issued an imperial edict

152
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,730
to lock down Mo Comes Again.

153
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,470

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,550
please let me take a look.

How dare you!

157
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,730
Who are you to treat my illness?

158
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,990
Chonglou would never poison you.

159
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,280
Your Majesty, you haven't verified it.

160
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,380
How can you give the order to execute him?

161
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,340
Are you accusing me

162
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,230
of not distinguishing right from wrong?

163
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,300
I swear with my life

164
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,660
that there must be something behind it.

165
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,620
Why would I want your life?

166
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,430
Remember,

167
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,510
no matter what happens,

168
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,620
it has nothing to do with you.

169
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,680
I bought you a house

170
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
in Xihe Town.

171
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,450
Go back as soon as possible.

172
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,580
Stay there

173

before I come back.

174
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,190
Don't go anywhere.

175
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,220
You didn't poison him.

176
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,320
Neither did I.

177
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,730
I can explain it

178
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,440
to His Majesty on my own.

179
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,320
Do you hear me?

180
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,310
Take care of yourself.

181
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,320
Don't try to save me.

182

Don't make me worried.

186

Go.

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,270

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,070
Yes.

194
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,430
My empress

195
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,630
said I lied to her.

196
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,390
And she wants to divorce me.

197
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,360
Tell me.

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,790
What should I do?

199
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,070
You can't divorce.

200
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,630
You can never see her again if you divorce.

201
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,289
Before I became the emperor,

202
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,679
I was with

203
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,350
the ladies

204
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,630
from those noble families.

205
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,539
But that was arranged by the late emperor.

206
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,049
How could I disobey the late emperor?

207
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,799
Right?

208
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,400
It's not my fault.

209
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,430
The empress even brought up the past.

210
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,120
She said when I was a kid,

211
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,710
I didn't tell her that I like her.

212
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,880
Was that a lie?

213
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,150
I was...

214
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,790
shy.

215
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,950
Your Majesty,

216
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,090
don't be upset.

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Just be happy.

218
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,030
Your Majesty,

219
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,160
if you are really unhappy,

220
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,330
we can play cards with you.

221
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's play Fighting the Landlord.

222
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,860
Come on.

223
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,140
Chains.

224
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,830
A straight flush.

225
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,280
A bomb.

226
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,670
A bomb.

227
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,590
A bomb again.

228
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,630
A bomb.

229
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,800
-Play.
-A bomb again.

230
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,680
I don't have any cards left either.

231
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,530
It doesn't count.

232
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,210
No way.

233
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,510
You can't go back on your word.

234
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,190
The Imperial Sword.

235
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,990
Shuffle the cards.

236
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,510
Okay.
