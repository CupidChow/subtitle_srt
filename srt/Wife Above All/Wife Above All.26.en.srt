[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,720
[Episode 26]

4
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,750
You just recovered from the plague.

5
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,350
Do you know how much I spent

6
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,860
in order to save you?

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,670
I wonder

8
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,530
if Prince An is willing to spend money

9
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,630
on you

10
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,920
if you are in Prince An's Mansion.

11
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,870
That's impossible.

12
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,620
Of course he's not willing.

13
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,470
The plague?

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,350
I have no money to pay you.

15
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,490
He has no money to pay us.

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,390
What should we do?

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,840
Let's make a deal then.

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,950
You

19
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,810
write down everything

20
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,670
that Prince An did

21
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,680
and

22
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,350
give it to us.

23
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,630
And I won't let you pay for the medicine.

24
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,150
We are generous.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,190
You want me to betray Prince An.

26
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,229
Impossible.

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,430
It's fine.

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,780
It's not a big deal.

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,570
Tonight,

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,759
let's torture him.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,620
Tomorrow,

32
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,200
we'll send him to Prince An's Mansion.

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,990
Tell me.

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,640
If Prince An knows

35
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,479
you failed to complete your task

36
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,479
and were caught by us,

37
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,740
and then we released you,

38
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,370
what would Prince An think?

39
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,350
What would he think?

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,150
Right.

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,440
Have you cleared the poison

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,430
in his body?

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,950
I forgot.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,240
Let me tell you.

45
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,550
If you go to Prince An's Mansion,

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,560
ask Prince An

47
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,510
to treat you.

48
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,740
Otherwise, you'll blame us

49
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,710
if you have a relapse of the plague.

50
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,040
We won't admit it.

51
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,329
I have something to say.

52
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,329
You have military rules.

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,810
You can't abuse prisoners.

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,640
Qin.

55
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,579
All done.

56
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,579
Well,

57
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,290
I've told you everything.

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,950
Can you give me some food?

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,790
I'm hungry.

60
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,710
Me too.

61
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,829
Why don't we go eat

62
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,590
roasted buns?

63
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,910
Roasted lamb?

64
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,100
Crayfishes.

65
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,500
Let's go.

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,420
Let's go.

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,510
I'm still here.

68
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:57,280
You can't abuse prisoners.

69
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,470
I'm hungry too.

70
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,670
General Yun has returned to the court.

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,260
Marquis Zhenxi has made great contributions by quelling the rebels.

72
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,420
I have promoted you

73
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,890
as the Commander of the Imperial Guards.

74
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,290
I hope you can take office immediately.

75
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,160
The safety of the people in the palace

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,420
depends on you.

77
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

78
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,790
Mo Jingyu.

79
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,920
I heard that your sister's family members

80
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,790
have made contributions in the army.

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,530
I will reward them all.

82
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

83
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:29,810
What?

84
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,250
Ms. Mo has something to say?

85
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,710
Your Majesty,

86
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,950
-I want to ask...
-Your Majesty.

87
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,790
She wants to ask on behalf of me

88
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,260
that Prince An...

89
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,350
Prince An embezzled the money and provisions for soldiers.

90
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,070
The amount is huge.

91
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,050
Even I was shocked.

92
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,540
I've issued an imperial edict

93
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,950
to demote Prince An to a county chief

94
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,180
and keep him away from the capital.

95
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,090
Your Majesty,

96
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,210
I think...

97
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,030
Your Majesty, you are wise.

98
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,870
We shall take our leave.

99
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,560
Let's go.

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,800
Let's go.

101
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,279
Thank you.

102
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,269
For what?

103
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,630
His Majesty dotes on Prince An.

104
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,230
Even though he committed such a serious crime,

105
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,480
he was just demoted to a county chief.

106
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,640
I was so angry

107
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,750
and wanted to say more.

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,000
Luckily, you stopped me.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,800
It's nothing.

110
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,650
No need to thank me.

111
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,230
Zilong,

112
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,110
do you really not care?

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Do you really not care

114
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,520
about the lives of the people of the Yun family

115
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,100
and 10-year banishment?

116
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,900
Of course I do.

117
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,960
When I first returned to the capital,

118
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,960
I only had hatred in my eyes.

119
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,910
I had no other thoughts.

120
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,590
But it's different this time.

121
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,800
You taught me

122
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,990
to make civilians the top priority.

123
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,230
Considering the current situation,

124
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,290
if I take revenge,

125
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm afraid there will be turbulence again

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,180
in the court.

127
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,680
I want to take revenge,

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,360
but I care more about the current peace.

129
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,280
I just don't know if you...

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,530
Me too.

131
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,270
Stop!

132
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,350
You can't go in.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,090
Are you blind?

134
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,620
Don't you recognize Prince An's carriage?

135
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,510
Everyone, get off for inspection.

136
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,150
Hurry up!

137
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,650
This is the ore

138
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,230
Prince An specially gave to His Majesty.

139
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,110
What?

140
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,930
Are you looking down on Prince An

141
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,320
because he was demoted?

142
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,990
Listen.

143
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,400
His Highness is

144
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,500
His Majesty's son.

145
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,090
If we are delayed,

146
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,430
there will be consequences.

147
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
County... County Chief An,

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,140
the carriage to the fief

149
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,480
is on its way.

150
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,430
County Chief An?

151
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,110
Fei Qian,

152
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,540
I'm never

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,830
a county chief.

154
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,080
And I won't go there.

155
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,630
Look.

156
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,650
Soon,

157
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,490
Father will summon me back.

158
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,390
Your Highness.

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,370
Banxia.

160
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,590
Sister,

161
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,010
do you remember

162
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,590
the ore's scent

163
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,470
we smelt at the gate of the city?

164
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,990
It smelt like grass and trees.

165
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,350
When I got close,

166
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,770
there was a cool scent.

167
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,550
The fragrance of grass?

168
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,740
A cool scent.

169
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,909
The fragrance of grass

170
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,710
and a cool scent.

171
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,000
I see.

172
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,470
Your Majesty,

173
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,170
you should see what kind of person

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,360
Yun Zilong is.

175
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Yun Zhen was in charge of military supplies, but the military supplies were adulterated.

176
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,380
So the 31 people of the Yun family were killed.

177
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,530
They deserved it.

178
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,550
Now Yun Zhen's son

179
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,790
said Prince An embezzled the money and provisions for soldiers.

180
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,840
This must be a frame-up.

181
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,420
It must be the Yun family

182
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
who made the military supplies adulterated.

183
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,350
Noble Consort Liu,

184
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,780
do you really think

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,390
I know nothing?

186
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,130
I think you and your son

187
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,309
know better than me

188
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,549
about the truth

189
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
of Yun Zhen

190
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,419
transporting the military supplies 10 years ago.

191
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,140
Your Majesty, you wronged me.

192
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,990
Do you have evidence?

193
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,390
Evidence?

194
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,390
