[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,650
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,780
Stop whining.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's giving me a headache.

6
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,280
It's not a big deal.

7
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,950
The wounds got on the battlefield

8
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,950
are much more serious than this.

9
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,910
As a man,

10
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,730
can't you put up with it?

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
Do you think I'm as tough

12
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,800
as you?

13
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,310
Besides,

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
you can have a military exploit if you are hurt.

15
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,030
What can I have?

16
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,870
Can you?

17
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,200
As a man, you should put up with it.

18
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,910
Qin, you have some letters in the book box

19
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,850
in your tent.

20
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,150
I guess they must be urgent letters.

21
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,590
I'll ask someone to send them to the capital tomorrow.

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
You peeped at my letters.

23
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,460
General Yun.

24
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,990
Come in.

25
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,870
General,

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,870
someone broke into the military camp.

27
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,669
Who?

28
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,240
Ms. Mo and Mrs. Yun.

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,230
I know.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,710
You may leave.

31
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,450
Yes.

32
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,750
Inspector.

33
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,550
You must be the two young ladies of the Mo family.

34
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,590
Aren't you gonna bow

35
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,880
when you see me?

36
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,590
Forget it.

37
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,400
Go away.

38
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,590
General Yun.

39
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,220
In a few days,

40
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,780
the imperial envoy will be here.

41
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,060
You'll be punished.

42
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,070
Why is he here?

43
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,480
He found out

44
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,630
there is something wrong with the military supplies.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,290
And I got beaten for no reason.

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,710
It hurts so much.

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,130
Enjoy it.

48
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,550
What? You have nails on your feet?

49
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,560
Come with me to check the medicine.

50
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,380
There is nothing wrong with the medicine.

51
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,350
It's good.

52
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,800
Where did you get it?

53
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,340
Obviously, it's fake.

54
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,040
We knew

55
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,950
there's something wrong with the medicine long ago.

56
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,600
We wanted to keep some

57
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,110
as the evidence and report.

58
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,530
But we were worried

59
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,409
about the soldiers' wounds.

60
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,870
So most of the fake medicine

61
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,310
were burned by us.

62
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,610
But who would have thought

63
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,640
there would be another batch of fake medicine?

64
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,000
Let me think about it.

65
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,909
That is to say,

66
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,140
in the beginning, you found

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,180
there was something wrong with the medicine.

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,270
So

69
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,990
you burned it.

70
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,140
What you gave the soldiers is good medicine.

71
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,870
But the soldiers still haven't recovered.

72
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,510
And you found another batch of fake medicine.

73
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,640
So Liu Zhengming

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,600
punished you and General Yun

75
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,950
with the accusation of fake military supplies.

76
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,150
That's what happened.

77
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,790
So...

78
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,890
So...

79
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,840
If I know why,

80
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,030
I wouldn't have been beaten.

81
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,159
So someone is determined

82
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,159
to punish you and General Yun

83
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,790
through the case of fake military supplies.

84
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,080
But why is Liu Zhengming

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,470
against General Yun?

86
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,150
Do you have evidence

87
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,409
to prove that Liu Zhengming did it?

88
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,830
Don't say I'm accusing him

89
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,980
without any evidence.

90
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,710
If not him, who else could it be?

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,720
Since it was him,

92
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,980
that means

93
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,760
Prince An gave the order.

94
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,510
Counterfeiting military supplies is a serious matter.

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,780
Back then, the Yun family was destroyed

96
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,930
because of this.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,760
If General Yun and I are punished,

98
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,230
you and Ms. Mo

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,030
will be implicated.

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,950
Mo's Clinic?

101
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,970
First, it was Qin's Medicine Shop.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,070
Then, it's Mo's Clinic.

103
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,160
Prince An is determined

104
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,830
to make the tragedy of the Yun family

105
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,190
happen to you and General Yun

106
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,110
again.

107
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,190
Let's divorce.

108
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,850
I don't want you to get implicated.

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,960
We need to keep investigating

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,110
the source of this batch of fake medicine.

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,680
Come on.

112
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,430
Get down.

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,550
What?

114
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,560
I was...

115
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,400
Flogged. I know.

116
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,750
That's the problem.

117
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,710
Since you were flogged,

118
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,590
why are there bruises

119
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,870
on your arms and shoulders?

120
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,070
Haven't you thought about it?

121
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,290
What?

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,540
Come here and get down.

123
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,230
I need to see your wounds

124
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,950
to find out

125
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:16,750
what's wrong.

126
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,190
Stop wasting time.

127
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,570
Don't move.

128
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,280
One.

129
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,150
Two.

130
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:23,700
Don't move.

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,820
Three.

132
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,280
My Lord,

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,520
I'm the inspector of the army.

134
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,900
General Yun has lined his pockets

135
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,740
and he doesn't care about the soldiers' lives.

136
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,870
I dare not lie to you.

137
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,230
Again.

138
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,150
I don't think it's as serious

139
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,490
as you said.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,850
Good.

141
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,320
They have almost recovered.

142
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,310
Everyone is full of vigor.

143
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,100
You, come here.

144
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,110
My Lord.

145
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,260
You're strong.

146
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,830
Have you ever got hurt?

147
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,950
My Lord,

148
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,340
I got hurt back then.

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,220
Thanks to Mr. Qin,

150
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,150
all the bruises and wounds on my body

151
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:29,850
are gone.

152
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:30,990
This...

153
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,309
is different from what you said.

154
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,280
Let me see.

155
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,620
Duke,

156
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,820
what happened to your neck?

157
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:40,799
My neck?

158
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,179
Right.

159
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,910
It's inevitable to bump against something in the military camp.

160
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,510
Let me take a look.

161
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:49,970
No need.

162
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,270
Duke,

163
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,010
there are so many bruises on your arms.

164
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,750
Did you bump against something?

165
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,350
I have highly effective medicine

166
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,020
for body injuries.

167
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,750
Let me apply it for you.

168
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,430
No need.

169
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,090
I've never bumped against anything in the military camp.

170
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,860
And I'm not hurt.

171
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,750
I'm poisoned.

172
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,960
This medicine

173
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,740
will only make it worse.

174
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,340
Where do you want to go?

175
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,130
Didn't you say we used medicine of low quality?

176
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,470
Why did you say it's related to poison?

177
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,760
[Side Story]

178
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,150
How do I look in this?

179
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,260
Not bad.

180
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,870
Domineering.

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,990
How about this?

182
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,910
Very good.

183
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,730
Handsome.

184
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,150
What about this?

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,400
Well, really?

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,910
You're just going to meet the eldest young lady of the Mo family.

187
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,880
It's not like you've never seen her.

188
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,600
You're talking about me?

189
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,430
Look at you.

190
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,740
You're here trimming your sideburns.

191
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,230
Mirror! Mirror!

192
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,080
Tell me.

193
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,950
Who is the most handsome man

194
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,070
in this world?
