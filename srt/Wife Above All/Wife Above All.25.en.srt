[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,730
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,230
Impressive.

5
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:13,910
Mr. Qin.

6
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,770
Mr. Qin.

7
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,789
Someone is outside the camp.

8
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,340
He said he came with His Majesty's oral edict.

9
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,550
He wants to ask about the plague.

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,500
His Majesty knows this so soon.

11
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,789
Right.

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,920
He said

13
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,280
the plague in the camp is serious.

14
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,240
It's not convenient to come here.

15
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,450
Mr. Qin, please go outside the camp to accept the imperial edict.

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,420
I'm going then.

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,960
So ugly.

18
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,530
Mr. Qin.

19
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,850
Have you seen Mr. Qin?

20
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,410
Some other soldiers fainted.

21
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,680
Didn't he go outside the camp

22
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,530
to accept the imperial edict?

23
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,850
I didn't hear anything about an imperial edict.

24
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,720
Some other soldiers in the camp

25
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,190
fainted.

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,160
Tell him.

27
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,320
Don't move.

28
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,390
It's you.

29
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,079
If you want your husband to go back alive,

30
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,090
give me the military camp's account book.

31
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,020
You work for Prince An.

32
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,680
Except him,

33
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,630
no one cares about the account book.

34
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,200
Young Lady Mo, you're really smart.

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,320
But don't you think it's a bit late?

36
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,620
Give me the account book,

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,640
and the grudge between Prince An and you

38
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,830
will be over.

39
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,350
After this,

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,870
Prince An

41
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,850
won't make things difficult for you anymore.

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,110
Why should I trust you?

43
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,930
You have no choice.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,390
Unless

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
you don't care

46
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,070
about Qin Chonglou's life at all.

47
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,610
If I give you the account book,

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,040
will you release Mr. Qin immediately?

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,750
I only know

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,220
if you don't give me the account book,

51
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,790
you will never see him again.

52
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,950
Are you okay?

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,930
I'm relieved since you are okay.

54
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,500
You must...

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,990
find

56
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,430
the evidence to... to prove Prince An is guilty.

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,670
This is my...

58
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,590
You...

59
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,550
You what?

60
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,470
Do you want me to be worried

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,709
or do you want to see me cry

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,850
because I'm so touched?

63
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,860
Your acting skill is lame.

64
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,390
Why didn't you fall on the floor?

65
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,770
Enough.

66
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,680
It's a pity

67
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,390
that you're not an opera actor.

68
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,230
Tell me.

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,280
What happened?

70
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,290
As soon as I went out,

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,380
I found something was wrong.

72
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,970
So I pretended to be infected with the plague.

73
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,670
Of course they didn't have the guts to come near me.

74
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,760
So I escaped

75
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,000
quickly.

76
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,830
You...

77
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,700
Awesome, right?

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,870
Awesome.

79
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,430
Aren't you wise?

80
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,670
You're very smart.

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,440
But you didn't notice the secret mark

82
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,830
I left you.

83
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,830
At that time,

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,630
I didn't know what was wrong

85
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,870
with my legs. I was running...

86
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,990
I was running quickly, but I still couldn't catch up with you.

87
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,760
Again?

88
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,850
Get up, Qin Chonglou.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,780
Are you addicted to acting?

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,860
Qin Chong...

91
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,670
Didn't you say

92
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,780
you pretended to be infected?

93
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Water.

94
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:08,750
Here.

95
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,650
Don't give him water.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,470
Don't give him water.

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,340
A few days ago, some refugees

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,080
wanted to drink water.

99
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,080
After drinking the water,

100
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,090
they were sick the next day.

101
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,160
Don't let him drink water.

102
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,660
Well...

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,350
Idiot! Idiot!

104
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,510
I asked you to send a spy to scare them.

105
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,430
But the assassin

106
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,590
ran faster than a rabbit.

107
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,010
I asked you to send a spy to arrest them.

108
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,180
But the spy was arrested by them.

109
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,950
Where is the account book?

110
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,550
You haven't brought it back

111
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,210
to me yet.

112
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,080
What's the use

113
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,000
of keeping you losers?

114
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,520
Calm down, Your Highness.

115
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,380
Mr. Qin has been infected with the plague.

116
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,090
The guards didn't dare to go near him.

117
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,710
After they found that Mr. Qin ran away,

118
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,900
they were worried that you would punish them.

119
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,110
That's why they ran away.

120
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,190
Run away?

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,870
Catch them.

122
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,870
And catch

123
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,990
that assassin too.

124
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,870
I will punish all of them.

125
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,550
Yes.

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,700
Come back.

127
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,380
How is it going at the mine?

128
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,620
Your Highness,

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,190
everything is going well.

130
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,180
Wish me good luck.

131
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,870
Wish you good luck.

132
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,570
Wish me success.

133
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,790
If you pretend to be dead, you'll become a little turtle.

134
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,470
How did you know I've recovered?

135
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,710
Not just you.

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,310
All the civilians have recovered.

137
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,680
Thanks to you. You risked your life

138
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,570
to drink that cup of water.

139
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,100
I risked my life?

140
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,100
Things got worse after the civilians

141
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,710
drank the water.

142
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,570
Only you survived.

143
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,370
Back then,

144
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,200
I was worried that you couldn't swallow the water.

145
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,780
So I put two green plums in it.

146
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,720
Unexpectedly,

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,110
the green plums neutralized the poison.

148
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,280
You're indeed my wife.

149
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,090
Later,

150
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,140
I need

151
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,130
to check on the civilians.

152
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,960
I just want to hug you.

153
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,430
Wait... Wait a minute.

154
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,840
Let me go.

155
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,810
Get well as soon as possible.

156
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,720
Don't just let me and my sister

157
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,150
handle everything.

158
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,440
What's the use

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,310
of you as a military doctor?

160
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,090
What's the use

161
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,170
of me as a military doctor?

162
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,200
I've recovered, Mo Banxia.

163
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,040
I'll let you know

164
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,950
what my use

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,990
is.

166
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,810
[Side Story]

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Here.

168
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,670
Take it.

169
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,390
Thank you.

170
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,200
It's hot. Be careful.

171
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,720
This is for you.

172
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,190
Be careful.

173
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,510
Take it.

174
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,110
Miss, thank you.

175
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,230
Be careful.

176
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,320
Why are you imitating me?

177
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,550
I want to feel your feelings.

178
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:33,860
Yun,

179
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
do you want to be a general

180
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,630
who's best at sighing?

181
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,360
Aren't you worried

182
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,770
about them

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,450
since they are

184
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,440
with the refugees every day?

185
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,300
I'm worried.

186
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,500
She'll have a feeling of unease if she doesn't save people.

187
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,970
I'll be worried if she saves people.

188
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,080
Between making her have a feeling of unease

189
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,920
and making me worried,

190
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,080
I choose making me worried.

191
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,520
Interesting.

192
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,200
Madam, it's hot. Be careful.

193
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,650
I should put some pressure on you.

194
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,190
What do you want to do again?

195
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,110
I received a report today.

196
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,630
Prince An

197
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,980
is secretly exploiting a mine.

198
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,740
What on earth does Prince An

199
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,590
want to do?
