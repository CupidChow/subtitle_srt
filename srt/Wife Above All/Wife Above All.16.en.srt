Women

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,810
should be discerning

6
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,440
to not be fooled

7
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,150
by some sweet words.

8
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,640
Also, they need skills

9
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,390
to not rely on their own husbands.

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,170
sweet-talk you?

15
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,150

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,910
We are from the Chamber of Commerce.

26
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,520
From the Chamber of Commerce?

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,890
We paid the rent yesterday.

28
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,950
The bill for supervision and inspection?

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,070
We paid the rent of this shop

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,220
General, you're not convinced?

41

They

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,590
are just collecting rent according to the rules.

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,590
General Yun, why did you

48
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,570
hurt them?

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,890
What kind of rule is that?

50
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,579
In the past, we only needed to give a tenth

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,850
for a business permit.

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,310
From this month onwards,

53

Those extra profits

56
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,790

57
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,130
But what you sell is medicine.

Is this how you hurt people

It's insulting.

No, I don't.

His Highness asked me to send it here.

99

I'm even less inclined to see it now.

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,390
Ms. Mo,

101
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,380
have you ever wondered

102
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,180
why Yun Zilong and Mr. Qin

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
to you and your sister?

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,170
I think

106
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,950
some things should be seen.

107
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,590
In case someone

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,790

109
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,550
but you treat them as your family.

110
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,950
Sweetheart, are you alright?

111
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,270
How about you?

112
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,350
Are you hurt?

113
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,870
Yun Zilong.

114
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,590
Let me ask you.

115
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,070
Why did you

116
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,150
marry into the Mo family?

117
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,510
You thought my father

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,710
was your enemy,

119
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,900
didn't you?

120
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,030
Am I right?

121
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,070
Banxia.

122
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,950
Are you aware of everything?

123
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,310
After we married,

124
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,400
Qin's Medicine Shop earned

125
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,590
314 taels of silver.

126
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,780
After deducting the debts,

127
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,870
there are 121 taels left.

128
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,030
You promised to give me a shop.

129
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,580
Apart from the shops and salaries,

130
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,790
-you still owe me...
-Forget it.

131
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,450
It's all yours.

132
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,120
We had an agreement

133
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,050
about the shops in the south of the city.

134
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,530
We split the profit 50-50.

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll return your mother's belongings

136

to you.

137
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,010
What's wrong?

138
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,430
Hang in there.

139
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,810
I'm Mo Banxia from Mo's Clinic.

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,660
My father is a physician.

141
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll take you to him now.

144
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,110

It's all yours.

146
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,200
I want to

147
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,270
settle this with you

148
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,159
and get even with you.

149
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,530
What do you take our Mo family for?

150
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,909
What do you take me for?

151
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:38,710
Do you really

152
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,070
regard us as your family?

153
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,390
You don't care

154
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,510
about what happened to the Mo family.

155
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,590
You only care about

156
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,720
whether the Qin family gets support,

157
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,590
don't you?

158
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,790
Yes.

159
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,290
Anything else?

160
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,630
No.

161
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,080
You know what happened afterwards.

162
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,830
Back then,

163
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,010
someone deliberately set up

164
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,700
to cause misunderstandings between us.

165
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
So I thought...

166
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,710
So I thought it was your father.

167
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,600
But now I've found out

168
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,670
the herbs

169
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,890
were tampered with by Prince An.

170
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,560
Why would I deliberately create chaos

171
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,430
to kill your father?

172
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,200
So...

173
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,790
Your care and concern

174
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,230
at first

175
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,880
were because you wanted to stay with the Mo family,

176
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,380
right?

177
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,710
Until you realized

178
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,340
it was a misunderstanding,

179
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,870
you tried to be good to me

180
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,370
because you felt guilty, right?

181
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,470
Yes.

182
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,870
You've known General Yun for many years.

183
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,170
You knew

184
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,630
he proposed for revenge,

185
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,510
but you still planned with him.

186
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,900
Yes.

187
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,310
What if the truth were still unclear?

188
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,110
Would you let him kill my father?

189
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes.

190
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
One last question.

191
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,300
Was my father's death

192
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,730
caused by General Yun?

193
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,980
Of course not.

194
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,800
He wouldn't.

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,480
It's useless for me

196
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,190
to explain now.

197
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,850
I must avenge my family.

198
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,420
What I'm going to do is dangerous.

199
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,820
If you want to divorce me,

200
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,700
I have no objections at all.

201
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,230
In this way,

202
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,780
you won't be implicated.

203
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,350
Yun Zilong,

204
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,440
do you think

205
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,110
your words are very touching?

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,980
You want to avenge your family?

207
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,430
Afraid of implicating me?

208
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,490
Didn't I tell you

209
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,360
if someone

210
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,750
tries to harm Mo's Clinic,

211
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,050
I won't let him off?

212
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,350
I'll send the repudiation letter

213
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,160
to the government office tomorrow.

214
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,510
Now,

215
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,250
please leave.

216
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,480
Jingyu.

217
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,030
Get lost!

218
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,120
Fine.

219
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,010
I'll listen to you.

220
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,160
But you have to stay out of

221
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,030
your father's death.

222
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:17,940
I'll avenge it for you.

223
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,720
There must be someone

224
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,900
adding fuel to the flame behind this.

225
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,330
They harmed our Yun family back then.

226
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,790
Now they're trying to

227
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,030
sow discord between us.

228
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,480
The person behind it

229
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,670
won't give up easily.

230
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,440
You're a girl with no power.

231
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,340
Be careful.

232
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,110
Yun Zilong.

233
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,620
He wouldn't.

234
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,440
But I married you

235
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,670
for the sake of the Qin family.

236
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,230
Now Qin's Medicine Shop

237
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,630
has become a medicated diet restaurant.

238
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,970
My legs are cured now.

239
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,050
I have no more worries.

240
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,590
If you want money,

241
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,180
just let me know how much you want.

242
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,520
Qin's Medicine Shop

243
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,550
won't give you a penny less.

244
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,960
Qin Chonglou.

245
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,990
Yun Zilong.

246
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,150
Yun Zilong.

247
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,310
If I hadn't

248
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,680
scattered Cassia seeds

249
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,790
but poison,

250
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,550
you would have already been blind.

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,230
I'm telling you.

252
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,890
I myself can take revenge

253
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,740
on my enemy.

254
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,690
I will protect

255
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,580
both my sister and me.

256
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,510
I don't need you

257
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,290
to be a hero

258
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,750
and self-righteous.

259
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,150
I've been taking revenge for ten years.

260
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,080
I don't want you

261
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,120
to suffer like me,

262
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,660
let alone put you in danger.

263
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,730
I don't need it.

264
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,040
[Side Story]

265
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,490
The men of the Yun family

266
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,670
are all good.

267
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,120
The Yun family?

268
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,810
Mo Xiang.

269
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,190
Mo Xiang.
