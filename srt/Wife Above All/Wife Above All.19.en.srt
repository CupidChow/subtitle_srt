[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,670
[Episode 19]

4
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,910
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,750
This is a snack

6
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,370
I designed for you.

7
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,550
It's named as "My Pure Heart."

8
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,070
Have a taste. Is it good?

9
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,870
Dear,

10
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,950
what have I done recently

11
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,830
that makes you so dissatisfied?

12
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,100
Only with a bite

13
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,850
can I taste the pain in your heart.

14
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,140
Your Majesty, in my opinion,

16
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,860
the ingredients

17
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,320
are prepared like

18
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,630
custom-made food in the medicated diet.

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
They are the dishes

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,940
tailor-made for the customers

21
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,390
according to their preferences.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,620
Although the snack tastes bitter,

23
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,590
the Noble Consort

24
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,840
designedly picked it for you.

25
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,230
Thank you, Ms. Mo.

26
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,590
Could it be that

27
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,700
you put too much endive

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,620
into it?

29
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,310
Ms. Mo is so lucky.

30
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,870
Your newly married husband

31
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,500
is so impressive.

32
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,860
I heard that a few days ago,

33
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,510
a servant of Mo's Clinic

34
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,230
fought with someone in the suburbs.

35
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,050
He was so domineering.

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,500
Yun Zilong

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,530
is the descendant of a sinner.

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,150
In the future,

39
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,550
he may do something

40
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,670
rebellious.

41
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,900
Your Majesty,

42
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,690
allowing such a person

43
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,460
to suppress the rebellion at the border

44
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,390
is not a good thing.

45
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,470
Brother Yun, what's the matter?

46
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,810
She wrote to me too.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,670
Really?

48
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,190
Where is my letter?

49
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,320
Where did you hide it?

50
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,110
Why would I take your letter?

51
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,480
I don't feel like reading it at all.

52
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,510
What is written in the letter?

53
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,430
Read for yourself.

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,150
She said

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,190
she used my money

56
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,030
to buy a birthday gift for me.

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,200
Brother Yun,

58
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,040
can you take a closer look?

59
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,450
She asked for an advance on your salary

60
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,010
to buy a birthday gift for His Majesty.

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,070
An advance on my salary?

62
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,320
She's trying to

63
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,510
earn you a good reputation.

64
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,769
Qin Chonglou.

65
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,200
You're jealous, aren't you?

66
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,649
Your Majesty,

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,230
the Mo family did do it.

68
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,630
But they are innocent.

69
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,510
Innocent?

70
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,990
Mo Jingyu,

71
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,870
it couldn't be your idea

72
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,050
to make such a scene.

73
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,110
Your Highness,

74
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,300
His Majesty's birthday is coming.

75
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,920
General Yun asked me

76
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,360
to bring some specialities from the Western Regions

77
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,640
as a gift.

78
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,110
Unexpectedly,

79
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,700
our men were intercepted halfway.

80
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,470
It's said that we had to pay money

81
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,890
to the chairman.

82
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,580
The Mo family

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,790
can't tolerate the token of loyalty from General Yun

84
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,990
to Your Majesty

85
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,370
being humiliated.

86
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,530
That's why they got agitated.

87
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,950
He's still in prison at the moment.

88
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,780
Didn't you say it's just a commodity?

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,820
Why is it a birthday gift again?

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,950
I wanted to prevent them from robbing,

91
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,790
so I disguised them as normal cargo

92
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,830
and put them on the boat.

93
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,910
Unfortunately,

94
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,270
we couldn't dodge the bullet.

95
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,840
Now,

96
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,830
the servant, along with the gift,

97
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,910
has been caught by the officials.

98
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,910
Bastard!

99
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,390
Who is this chairman?

100
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,050
How dare he detain the gift

101
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,610
my loyal officials prepared for me!

102
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,070
I heard

103
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,380
the chairman, Chu Dezhao,

104
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,230
is Prince An's trusted aide.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,250
I dare not say anything.

106
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,380
Go ahead.

107
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,530
Noble Consort Liu

108
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,000
should know more about the details.

109
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,770
Prince An has many subordinates.

110
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,230
It's complicated.

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,400
How do we know

112
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
what they have done?

113
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,860
You're right.

114
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,010
Prince An is noble.

115
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,290
How would he

116
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,040
be a robber?

117
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,150
It must be the chairman, Chu Dezhao,

118
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,050
who takes advantage of his power.

119
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,000
The Mo family

120
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,470
fought back

121
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,970
only for

122
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,060
self-defence purposes.

123
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,340
You're wise, Noble Consort.

124
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,870
I think so.

125
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,680
Your Majesty.

126
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,510
Regarding this matter,

127
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,190
I was thoughtless.

128
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,570
If it's delayed,

129
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,080
and I can't present the gift

130
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,150
to Your Majesty personally,

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,710
I shall

132
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,210
apologize on behalf of my husband.

133
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,760
How dare he detain my stuff?

134
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Guards.

135
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:34,830
Yes.

136
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,230
Go and release

137
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,320
the Mo family's servant.

138
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,190
Yes.

139
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,220
Your Majesty is wise.

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,680
Wait.

141
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,159
Ask the Ministry of Justice to investigate

142
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,330
what the chairman

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,540
does usually.

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,630
Yes.

145
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,340
Dear, thank you

146
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,270
for reminding me of this.

147
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,620
You've really put in a lot of effort.

148
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,230
I'm flattered.

149
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,340
It's all thanks to Ms. Mo

150
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,190
for being so smart.

151
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,870
They didn't explain

152
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,420
why they spent so much money at all.

153
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,000
Should we guess about

154
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,100
what women think or not?

155
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,480
The last time we went to the brothel,

156
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,090
we ended up miserable.

157
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,480
What's there to guess

158
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,470
about women's minds?

159
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,390
Whatever they ask us to do,

160
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,930
we fully cooperate

161
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,080
and devote ourselves sincerely

162
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,490
to satisfy them.

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,150
Aren't you curious?

164
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,909
I am.

165
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,030
Why didn't you ask?

166
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,270
I dare not ask.

167
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,590
Here.

168
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,360
Why do you have a letter?

169
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,230
But I don't have it.

170
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,750
These are all ledgers,

171
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,190
not letters.

172
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,309
Did Banxia write it?

173
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,570
Is it a letter for me?

174
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,260
So why isn't it a letter?

175
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,570
Why did they spend so much money again?

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,240
Banxia is really something.

177
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,970
I gave her all the Qin family's assets,

178
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,620
yet she can still be so thrifty.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Did you also give all your salary

180
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,630
to Ms. Mo?

181
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,190
General.

182
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,390
Something happened.

183
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,150
What's wrong?

184
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,320
Some of the soldiers

185
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,350
have almost recovered,

186
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,680
but suddenly they start bleeding out

187
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,100
and are in a coma.

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,890
[Side Story]

189
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,370
Right away.

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,880
This chair is too dirty.

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,790
Come here quickly

192
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,540
and wipe it for me.

193
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,050
Hurry up.

194
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,390
Coming.

195
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,280
What's the problem?

196
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,350
I'm the ambassador for high-quality men

197
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,180
in the capital.

198
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,860
Such trivial matters

199
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,460
should be done

200
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,020
by your wife.

201
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,930
Looks like you're not here to see a physician.

202
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,550
Wait.

203
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,920
Here.

204
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,080
There are peppers here.

205
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,510
They always order this.

206
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,470
Two more.

207
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,350
This is their speciality.

208
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,910
Be careful.

209
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,350
Their dishes are really good.

210
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,270
Sir,

211
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,510
the clinic is opposite.

212
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,240
I've been there.

213
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm here for you.

214
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,820
How about you marry me?

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
You're rich and powerful?

216
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,430
I can't tell that.

217
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,270
Serve me the most expensive

218
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,030
dish and wine.

219
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,570
You are really worth a fortune.

220
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,660
Just one serving

221
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,220
is not worthy of your status.

222
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,870
How about

223
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,050
buying some more

224
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,430
for your wealthy friends

225
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,170
to have a taste?

226
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,080
Okay.

227
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,610
Send them

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,680
to each of my friends in the capital.

229
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,360
You don't have many friends, do you?

230
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,380
Are you looking down on me?

231
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,110
I have plenty of money.

232
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,950
Don't make it difficult for my wife.

233
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,370
Do you think you can bribe her

234
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,450
with that little money?

235
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,330
Listen,

236
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,750
even if Mo Comes Again Medicated Diet Restaurant

237
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,110
treat all the people in the city

238
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,100
to a meal,

239
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,200
we won't treat you.

240
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,830
Leave now.

241
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,940
What's wrong with you?

242
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,510
Give it to me.

243
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,080
You...

244
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,220
Do you know how much money he can make us earn?

245
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,330
I don't care.

246
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,690
That's easy for you to say.

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,970
No wonder you lost all your money.

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,570
I don't allow him to enter this restaurant anyway.

249
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,760
I don't care about his money.

250
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,550
Get out!

251
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,570
Go out and drum up some business.

252
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,600
If there are less than 100 tables,

253
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,500
don't come back tonight.

254
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,800
It's just 100 tables.

255
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,620
I'm going out.

256
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
I'll get out of here.

257
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,170
You...

258
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,610
Qin Chonglou!
