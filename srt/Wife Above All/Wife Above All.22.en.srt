[Episode 22]

4
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,990
You go to the front.

5
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,430
You guard the rear.

6
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,160
What's that smell?

7
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,160
That was really scary.

8
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,100
I did everything.

9
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,930
It has nothing to do with others.

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,240
Hurry. Give me a cup of water.

11
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,140
Lie.

12
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:47,910
Yes.

13
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:48,910
Take him down.

14
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,710
Yes.

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,000
Go.

16
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,220
I'm the duke.

17
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,300

depends on you, General Yun.

20
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,400
I'll do my best.

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,460
Mr. Wen, thank you for your cultivation.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,829
What are you doing?

23
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,040
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,829
You're wearing my clothes.

25
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,430
Why did you steal Lie's clothes?

26
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,880
What do you mean by stealing?

27
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,030
I understand.

28
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,040
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

29
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,350
Sister,

30
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,730
are we really not gonna stay here for a few more days?

31
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,220
The soldiers

32
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
haven't fully recovered yet.

33
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,960
We came here

34
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,490
to fulfill a doctor's duty.

35
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,400
I've given the prescription of the antidote

36
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,740
to Mr. Qin.

37
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,030
It's meaningless

38
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,090
to stay here.

39
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,790
You are a general. After you.

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,390
You have a silver tongue.

41
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,310
After you.

42
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,590
Isn't this General Yun?

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Mr. Qin.

44
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,620
What a coincidence.

45
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,150
Are you really leaving?

46
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,830
The poison has been removed from your body,

47
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,100
but you lost too much energy and blood.

48
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,029
You should take the medicine

49
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,250
every day.

50
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,960
Back then, I said I used you.

51
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,340
Why are you still helping me now?

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,230
I'm gonna put away the medicine for you.

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,990
This... This...

54
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,270
Thank you.

55
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,490
I'll put it away myself later.

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,710
What's that?

57
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,310
It's a military secret.

58
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,320
I'm also in the military camp.

59
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,830
Why don't I know any secret?

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,500
It's for you.

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,160
I miss you, and I'm like the full moon,

62
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,880
whose light dims night by night.

63
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,530
I miss you every day, but I don't see you.

64
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,900
I was with you enjoying beautiful scenery,

65
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,350
and now I feel depressed because I miss you so much.

66
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,980
Why

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
didn't I know

68
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,270
you have this kind of taste?

69
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,159
Banxia,

70
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,830
it's been days since we were parted.

71
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,430
How have you been in the capital?

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,870
I wrote these to you.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,040
Didn't you say

74
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,310
you've never liked me

75
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,070
and you were just using me?

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,480
I...

77
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,190
I didn't want to get you implicated.

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,590
Then today,

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,760
you're not afraid of getting me implicated?

80
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,010
Because I like you.

81
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,860
Because I've been missing you every day

82
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,690
since we were parted.

83
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,150
The longer we are parted,

84
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,630
the more I miss you.

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,710
If I say

86
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,460
I really regret

87
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,590
saying what I said to you,

88
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,640
will you forgive me now?

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,790
No.

90
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,320
As for the future,

91
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,310
it depends on my mood.

92
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,280
These letters...

93
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:56,409
I'll take them

94
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,080
as your sincerity.

95
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,870
Lie,

96
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,840
don't specially deliver chicken soup

97
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,790
to me again.

98
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,020
These...

99
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,170
And don't deliver

100
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,950
these wild flowers to me again.

101
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,130
These are from the soldiers.

102
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,470
I know.

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,550
But I'm a doctor.

104
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,070
You gave me a bunch of chrysanthemums every day.

105
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Do you want me to cure the patients

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,040
or not?

107
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,670
No, no.

108
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,730
That's not what we meant.

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,260
General wouldn't allow me to tell you.

110
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,390
Fine.

111
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,620
Just let him punish me.

112
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,520
In fact, the chicken soup I delivered every day

113
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,550
was made by General.

114
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,600
And these wild flowers

115
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,740
were picked by General before dawn.

116
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,980
Okay, I know. You may leave.

117
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
I was patrolling the mountain today.

118
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,900
I saw the flowers blooming beautifully.

119
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,270
I thought of you.

120
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,940
So I picked some.

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,890
I want to give them to you.

122
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,590
Why do I think

123
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,460
what Lie taught me

124
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,250
is so strange?

125
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,610
What do you think?

126
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,440
I made it like this.

127
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,860
It doesn't look like a rabbit.

128
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,720
Should I give it to her?

129
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,110
General...

130
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,780
Come in.

131
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,800
General.

132
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,890
Bad news!

133
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,190
The young ladies of the Mo family have left.

134
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,590
You're making things difficult for me again.

135
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,250
What are you doing?

136
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,210
Well done.

137
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,680
Without my order,

138
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
no one can enter or leave.

139
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,230
Which battalion are you in? I'll reward you after we go back.

140
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,550
Thank you, General Yun.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,950
General Yun.

142
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,810
That's my cousin.

143
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,640
Cousin?

144
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,160
Brother-in-law.

145
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,320
Zhen,

146
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,960
don't you remember me?

147
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm Chengqi.

148
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,750
Huo Chengqi from Xihe Town.

149
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,300
When we were kids,

150
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,880
you took me to catch fishes.

151
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,950
I pushed you into the water,

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,560
and you hit my head with a stone.

153
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,490
Xihe Town?

154
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,050
I kind of don't remember

155
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,840
what happened when I was a kid.

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,450
When did you

157
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,590
take him to catch fishes?

158
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,470
Zhen,

159
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,130
your eyes

160
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,970
are very special.

161
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,070
I recognized you immediately

162
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,080
when you just came here.

163
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,220
Right.

164
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,350
You have a tattoo that looks like the leaves of hedgerows

165
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,360
on your wrist, right?

166
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,760
It was done by your mother.

167
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,890
Because my mother's name

168
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,260
is Jiang Li.

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,160
[Side Story]

170
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,660
Those are not wounds.

171
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,730
What they need is the way to remove the poison.

172
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,960
They just need to draw out the poison twice a day

173
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,790
and drink more water.

174
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,240
Why are you shy?

175
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,140
I'm treating you.

176
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,350
Tell the soldiers

177
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,120
not to tell anyone about the antidote.

178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,030
If someone bad knows this

179
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,700
and poisons you again,

180
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,430
there will be nothing we can do.

181
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm going out.
