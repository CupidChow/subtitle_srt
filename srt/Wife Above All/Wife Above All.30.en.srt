194
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,270
That's a good name.

195
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,350
Wen,

196
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,110
I want to ask the empress

197
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,250
to go to the northwest with me to have fun with them.

198
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,470
What do you think?

199
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,990
I'm afraid...

200
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,090
It's settled then.
