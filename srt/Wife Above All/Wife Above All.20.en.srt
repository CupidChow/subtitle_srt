4
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,940
Do you know what's wrong with them?

5
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,150
It's not a big problem.

6
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,430
Have a good rest.

7
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,550
Come with me.

8
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,420
Tell me what happened.

9
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,270
Don't shout.

10
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,750
Don't cause a decline in morale.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,460
They've been injured for so many days.

12
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Tell me the truth.

13
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,170
If there are no other choices,

14
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,880
I'll submit a report to His Majesty

15
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,990
so that he can send a physician soon.

16
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,910
The wounds of the soldiers

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,140
should heal within three days

18
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,700
at the soonest.

19
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,360
But now the wounds

20
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,270
are getting worse.

21
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,680
Something is wrong.

22
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,829
Which pharmacy

23
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,390
provides herbs for the army?

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,800
You're suspecting...

25
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,380
I'm not only suspecting.

26
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,090
It's him.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,060
He has no conscience!

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,480
He deserves to die.

29
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,070
He conned us out of our hard-earned money.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,540
Chu Dezhao deserves the punishment.

31
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,970
It's really satisfying.

32
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,480
Sister, you are so smart.

33
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,500
You mentioned the birthday gift.

34
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,280
And His Majesty sided with us

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,350
without any doubts.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
But Sister,

37
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,970
did you really send the birthday gift to the palace?

38
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,350
Of course.

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,780
The money I borrowed from General Yun

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,079
and Mr. Qin

41
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,630
is not enough.

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,430
I have to pay out of my own pocket.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,829
That's a huge amount.

44
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,750
We could have bought plenty of food with that.

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,070
But

46
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,910
seeing Chu Quede get his karma

47
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:39,660
is worth it.

48
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,680
However,

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,840
Lu Rong has suffered a lot in these two days.

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,420
Let him take a rest.

51
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,510
Take a rest?

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,360
I can only allow him to drink a few more cups of tea.

53
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,870

54
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,710

57

in mind,

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,370
and add it into his performance.

59
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,360
As for the year-end bonus,

60
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,670
I will treat him well.

61
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,860
That's good.

62
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,830
Now,

63
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,610

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,990
Tell me.

72
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,590

80
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,520
that's not the whole story.

Since you can't tell,

110
