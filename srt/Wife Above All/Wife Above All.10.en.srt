[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,590
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,510
My daughter was bullied again?

5
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,960
To be precise,

6
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,830
the one being bullied was our Qin...

7
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,900
Qin and what?

8
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,390
Everything I have belongs to Banxia.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,880
It's all my fault.

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,620
My dear daughter.

11
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,020
Father.

12
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,700
After you drink this medicine,

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,789
I'll forgive you.

14
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,430
Father,

15
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,590
you don't have to worry about me anymore.

16
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,710
It's all right if I don't receive

17
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,690
treatment for my legs.

18
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,660
Don't be so insatiable.

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,490
Just drink it as I said.

20
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,200
Our Mo Family's good reputation

21
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,229
can't be ruined because of you.

22
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:56,780
Drink it!

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,509
I'll drink it.

24
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,760
Prince An

25
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,570
saved my eldest daughter

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,780
and invested in Qin's Medicine Shop.

27
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,410
What is his purpose?

28
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,810
Prince An wants to invest in Qin's Medicine Shop.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,250
I've calculated it.

30
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,810
Qin's Medicine Shop can be expanded by ten times.

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,750
Does it mean that

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,870
I can make a fortune?

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,210
How come you're so eager to make a fortune?

34
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,960
Is the money I gave you

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,930
not enough for you?

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,240
Or are you afraid that Qin Chonglou's disease

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,960
can't be cured?

38
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,630
Prince An

39
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,360
is either out of his mind

40
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,420
or has ulterior motives.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,140
For this shabby Qin's Medicine Shop of yours,

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,480
even His Majesty

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,790
has said that he won't use your herbs anymore.

44
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:52,850
How could he be so kind?

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,880
How could he be so kind?

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,310
Father,

47
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,160
Prince An

48
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,890
is the most capable prince

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,100
except for the Crown Prince.

50
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,450
All this time,

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,550
he has been making friends with many good officials.

52
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,130
Many people are on good terms with him.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
I've heard that he has also established a good relationship

54
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,040
with chambers of commerce

55
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,890
and pharmacies recently.

56
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,340
I'm afraid

57
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,120
he has a scheme privately.

58
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,120
Then why does Prince An

59
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,750
want to invest in

60
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,550
Qin's Medicine Shop, whose sales volumes are so low?

61
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,570
Is it because of Mo's Clinic?

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,680
I know what to do.

63
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,000
My Lady!

64
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,160
Slow down.

65
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,480
My Lady,

66
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,770
according to your order,

67
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,510
I've taken off all the plaques

68
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,750
in Qin's Medicine Shop.

69
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,520
Though you don't want to give up Qin's Medicine Shop,

70
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,970
you don't have to take off the plaques and remove the shop from the market, right?

71
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,680
Neither you nor I can guess

72
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,550
what Prince An is thinking about.

73
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,070
We can't earn the money from him.

74
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,800
Qin's Medicine Shop

75
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,820
can't exist for the time being.

76
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,830
What should I do with these herbs

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,390
which I've just purchased?

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
I think no one will buy them now.

79
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,430
Do we have to eat them at our three meals?

80
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,270
Eating them at our three meals?

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
What on earth do they want to do?

82
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,390
How come we can't defeat them in any aspect?

83
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,709
Now it seems that

84
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,450
they are working hard for the same goal.

85
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,630
All the family members are living in harmony.

86
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,670
I have over ten siblings,

87
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,000
as well as seven or eight concubines.

88
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,660
I never believe in the saying that

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,580
if the family members are of the same mind,

90
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,140
they can conquer everything.

91
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,910
Though it seems that they're living in harmony now,

92
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,090
it's just because the temptation in front of them

93
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,590
isn't big enough.

94
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,760
Your Highness,

95
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,370
we've been planning this for so long.

96
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,560
Qin's Medicine Shop has shut down just like that.

97
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,310
What should we do next?

98
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,520
What's there to be afraid of if the Qin's Medicine Shop has shut down?

99
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,740
Now,

100
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,530
isn't there a better choice?

101
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,900
A better choice?

102
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,830
I am

103
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,110
a general,

104
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,710
but I need to cook?

105
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,340
Si Qin has started to cook.

106
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,540
But I don't think

107
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,880
she can manage alone.

108
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,000
Logically speaking,

109
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,070
Qin should do it.

110
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,130
But you know his health condition.

111
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,950
He can't even reach the stove.

112
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,960
With his wheelchair,

113
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,410
it is quite suitable for him to deliver food.

114
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,220
I'm a general.

115
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,040
I know.

116
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,640
I'm not a cook.

117
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,340
Our Mo Family doesn't raise idle people.

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,380
I'm very busy with military affairs.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm not an idle man.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,460
Brother-in-law, try to understand my words carefully.

121
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,390
I'm talking about the family.

122
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,360
My sister

123
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,760
has given all your laboring time

124
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,830
to me.

125
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,030
From today onwards...

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,470
No.

127
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,080
Today, you must finish making

128
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,670
all the herbal cuisine recorded on the first ten pages.

129
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,080
I'll check them tonight.

130
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Don't waste the ingredients.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,470
I am

132
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,310
a general.

133
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,790
Brother-in-law.

134
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,720
Don't waste the ingredients.

135
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,930
I'm a Great General.

136
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,710
Go for it!

137
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,630
Great General.

138
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,420
General!

139
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,470
General! General!

140
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,860
Why are you making such a big fuss?

141
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,360
How is it going with the task

142
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,790
I've asked you to do?

143
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,130
General.

144
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,350
God is helping you.

145
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,280
Today, I saw...

146
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,910
This morning, I saw

147
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,870
the man who delivered food boxes.

148
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,680
It means that

149
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,659
if you want to get anything recorded

150
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,510
in this recipe,

151
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,170
he can make it.

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,080
Stop cooking.

153
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,159
The food box will be delivered here soon.

154
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,720
Don't be nervous.

155
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,190
I'm nervous?

156
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,350
Are you kidding me?

157
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,909
Well,

158
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,130
don't deliver it too early.

159
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,240
If I finish cooking too soon,

160
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,110
people will find out about it.

161
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,940
Besides,

162
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,220
don't cook too well.

163
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,500
It doesn't make sense.

164
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,300
Tell the food-box delivery man

165
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,210
to be careful

166
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,070
when he delivers the food.

167
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,490
Ask him not to be discovered by others.

168
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,510
Got it.

169
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,750
Come back.

170
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,390
Don't be nervous.

171
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,070
Iâ€™m not nervous, General.

172
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't be nervous.

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,330
With your good cooking skills,

174
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,220
you don't need to fight in the battlefields.

175
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,470
Did you first

176
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,790
work as a cook in the army?

177
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,550
As a general,

178
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,480
I can manage thousands of soldiers.

179
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,520
A few herbs are nothing to me.

180
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,230
Qin.

181
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,800
How is your task of

182
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,890
delivering food going?

183
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,670
It's just like that.

184
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,200
What do you mean by being just like that?

185
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,850
It's not bad.

186
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,350
Read it.

187
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,270
Two food boxes for

188
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,590
the family feast of the Dings.

189
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,720
One food box for

190
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,040
the Chess Club in the east of the city.

191
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,270
Three food boxes for

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,370
the post house on the west of the river.

193
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,390
Next is a big order.

194
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,550
Fourteen food boxes for...

195
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,470
Go on.

196
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,270
Mo's Clinic.

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
[Side Story]

198
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,260
Have you really taken Mo Banxia's advice

199
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,210
and shut down Qin's Medicine Shop?

200
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,180
Aren't you afraid that

201
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,350
she'll take your family property away?

202
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,180
My family property is so meagre that

203
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,490
there's nothing she can take away.

204
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,720
Let me tell you.

205
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,300
Now I have a different

206
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,110
feeling for her.

207
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,320
What feeling?

208
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,179
I just feel that now I can

209
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,080
trust her

210
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,110
more and more.

211
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,669
And I'm very willing to trust her.

212
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:45,210
I think you look well today.

213
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,760
Are you feeling better after Mo Xiang

214
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,460
treated your leg disease?

215
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,590
I drank the medicine

216
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,650
for the sake of

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,420
Mo Xiang.

218
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,650
But I know the actual effect clearly.

219
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,660
Do you want to eat it?

220
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,490
It's useless.

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,910
Do you want to eat it?

222
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:56,630
No.

223
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,320
Just eat it.

224
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,630
You're right.

225
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,750
It's useless.
