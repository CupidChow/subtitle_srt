[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,800
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,220
That night,

5
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,860
bandits came to our house.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,600
They killed people and set a fire.

7
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,590
They robbed us.

8
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,450
My mother and I hid in the attic.

9
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,650
That's why we survived.

10
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,230
Where did the bandits come from?

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,740
They acted so arrogantly.

12
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,680
Actually, they were not

13
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,500
real bandits.

14
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,260
I heard their conversation

15
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,539
in the attic.

16
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,350
Back then,

17
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,310
it was indeed Mo Xiang, who came to the capital,

18
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,729
who delivered the medicine to the frontline.

19
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,930
But Prince An kept the medicine to himself without permission.

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,610
They did a clean job.

21
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,150
They didn't leave any trace behind.

22
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,740
That's why General Yun

23
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,270
thought Mr. Mo was the one

24
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,990
who harmed the Yun family.

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm sorry. I...

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,950
Shut your mouth.

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,620
You continue.

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,950
Later, I heard them say

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,660
they were targeting the two biggest clinics

30
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,960
in the capital.

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,740
But Mo Xiang was determined.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,360
He only treated civilians.

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,230
And he was deeply trusted by His Majesty.

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,720
So it was inconvenient for them

35
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,920
to take action on Mo's Clinic.

36
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,040
That's why they targeted

37
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,910
Qin's Medicine Shop.

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,970
My family members were killed.

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,360
Although I survived,

40
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,510
Qin's Medicine Shop

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,410
doesn't belong to the Qin family.

42
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,340
Prince An kept the medicine to himself

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,510
and forced my family members to help him transport the medicine.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,030
After that,

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,660
he set a fire and burnt the whole village.

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,860
Our family members

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,740
are gone.

48
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,100
So,

49
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,510
all these years,

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,270
Prince An has gained so many ways

51
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,380
to transport the medicine.

52
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,220
What exactly does he want to do?

53
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,090
What kind of place

54
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,310
needs to use medicine constantly?

55
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,030
It's either a clinic

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,740
or a military camp.

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,010
A military camp?

58
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,810
Prince An wants to start a...

59
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,990
The Yun family.

60
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,860
The Qin family.

61
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,860
The Mo family.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,510
The Huo family.

63
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,270
Those who have collected military supplies

64
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,140
were either punished

65
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,930
or killed for no reason.

66
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,110
I know you don't want to see me.

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,040
But now,

68
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,190
you've offended Liu Zhengming.

69
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,600
Mr. Mo was also killed.

70
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,380
Noble Consort and Prince An

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,710
won't let you go easily.

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,650
Since we all want

73
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
to take revenge on Prince An,

74
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,580
you should stay in the camp for the time being.

75
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:07,990
If something happens,

76
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,030
I can still take care of you.

77
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,590
Stay.

78
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,090
Prince An has many followers.

79
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,190
And now, he's favored

80
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,680
by His Majesty.

81
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,970
There are only a few of us.

82
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,269
If we fight against Prince An,

83
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,710
isn't that like throwing an egg at a rock?

84
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,900
Count me in.

85
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,850
Count me in.

86
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,830
Sister,

87
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,720
only by working together

88
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,740
can we avenge our father.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,450
We won a great victory at Qulingguan.

90
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,320
We won a great victory at Qulingguan.

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
We won a great victory at Qulingguan.

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,380
We won a great victory at Qulingguan.

93
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,870
Thanks to His Majesty, I, Yun Zilong,

94
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,840
had the chance to lead you to guard Qulingguan.

95
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,170
We won a great victory this time,

96
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,500
but we've suffered great casualties.

97
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,150
I

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,440
feel guilty towards you.

99
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,710
General is mighty!

100
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:44,470
General is mighty! General is mighty!

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,590
Qin.

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,760
You won a great victory at Qulingguan.

103
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,740
When you return to the capital,

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,890
His Majesty will definitely give you

105
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,830
a lot of things as rewards.

106
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,240
Congratulations.

107
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,210
What great victory?

108
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,200
It's just that General Yun

109
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,550
doesn't want to hurt the soldiers' feelings.

110
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,590
In a few days,

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
I'll ask someone to escort you back.

112
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280
We can't retreat the troops at Qulingguan

113
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,350
for now.

114
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,420
You are not going to go back?

115
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,650
What happened again?

116
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,720
Have you become a fool

117
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,150
after being poisoned these days?

118
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,730
No.

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,480
So there was something wrong with your brain before you were poisoned.

120
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,070
According to what is said in the ledger,

121
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,659
the weapons in the military camp

122
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,750
are

123
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,580
more than enough.

124
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,290
But the weapons we have

125
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,220
are far from enough.

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,620
We were lucky to win this time

127
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,360
because General Yun and the soldiers

128
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,190
put up

129
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,920
a desperate fight.

130
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
I can't believe he takes wars at the border as a joke

131
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,220
just for money.

132
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,570
Prince An is cunning

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,400
and vicious.

134
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm afraid this victory

135
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,270
is just a trap set by him.

136
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
What do you mean?

137
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
You heard this before.

138
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,440
Quelling the unrest at Qulingguan

139
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
was under the leadership of the crown prince in the capital.

140
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
The victory at Qulingguan

141
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,580
means

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
the crown prince's position in the court

143
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,890
has been strengthened.

144
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,840
So Prince An

145
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,860
will have less chance, right?

146
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,470
Wait.

147
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,480
You just said

148
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,470
the army is short of weapons.

149
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,340
But the rebels came aggressively.

150
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,060
Even though they were defeated,

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,590
how could they

152
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,850
lose so badly?

153
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,020
Prince An and the rebels...

154
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,400
Don't talk nonsense without evidence.

155
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,870
If my guess is right,

156
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,170
the rebels at the border

157
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,450
will definitely come back.

158
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,510
By that time, Prince An

159
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,920
will incite the officials in the court

160
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,000
to say that the crown prince fails his duty in the capital.

161
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,820
Then he'll personally lead an army to conquer the rebels.

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,670
In that way,

163
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,670
he can make a great contribution.

164
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,150
If the rebels really come back

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,250
like you said,

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,630
General Yun will be accused of lying about the war situation.

167
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,440
The charge of failing his duty

168
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,590
will become real.

169
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,330
Why don't

170
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,040
you and General Yun go back to the capital first

171
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,280
and tell His Majesty everything?

172
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,130
Even though His Majesty favors Prince An,

173
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,640
he won't ignore

174
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,360
the national military affairs.

175
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,060
If we go back to the capital and report to His Majesty,

176
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,900
we can surely stay out of it.

177
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,059
But

178
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,340
what about the civilians at the border?

179
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,690
There are so many innocent people.

180
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,210
I still want to stay.

181
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,039
I want to save as many as I can,

182
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,170
even if I'll be cursed.

183
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,290
Fine.

184
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,780
I've made up my mind too.

185
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,430
I won't leave either.

186
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
Why?

187
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,950
Didn't you say

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,330
you're not afraid of getting me implicated?

189
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,290
By God's will,

190
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,600
His Majesty's edict:

191
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,780
General Yun Zilong

192
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,470
has made a contribution by quelling the unrest at Qulingguan.

193
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,020
You are supposed to return to the capital immediately

194
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
to be promoted as the Commander of the Imperial Guards.

195
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,370
However, you said

196
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,310
you want to eliminate the rebels.

197
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,510
Considering your loyalty

198
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,640
to the country,

199
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,610
I allow you to stay at Qulingguan.

200
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,630
You can come back to the capital to receive rewards some other day.

201
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

202
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,600
[Side Story]

203
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,200
The mission I'm about to tell you

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
is very important.

205
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,950
General

206
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
has ordered us

207
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,700
to listen to Mr. Qin.

208
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,910
Good.

209
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,140
Which one of you

210
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,280
knows how to make sugar figures?

211
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,590
Sugar figures?

212
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,270
Sugar figures?

213
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,710
Can you teach me?

214
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,200
General Yun said

215
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,170
you're best at drawing.

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,780
I draw city defense maps.

217
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,360
City defense maps?

218
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,760
What about you?

219
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,540
I draw notices for wanted persons.

220
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,870
I only know how to make mud people.

221
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,290
It's still drawing, right?

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,730
How can they be the same?

223
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,190
I don't care.

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,770
Go find someone.

225
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,340
I don't believe I can't find a person

226
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,670
who knows how to make sugar figures at Qulingguan.
