[The Grave of Our Beloved Father Mr. Mo Xiang, Nicknamed Shaoyang]

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,560
Sister,

6
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,560
where should we go in the future?

7
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Should we still go back to our hometown?

8
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,930
What our father said today

9
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,880
reminded me of

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,080
what had happened in my childhood.

11
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,770
I was still young back then.

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,200
My mother had just passed away.

13
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,229
Our father brought you back from outside.

14
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,670
He told me that

15
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,560
I should treat you

16
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,180
as my own younger sister.

17
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,510
What do you mean by treating me as your younger sister?

18
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,700
I am your younger sister.

19
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,460
Mo Banxia.

20
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,199
From today onwards,

21
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:09,699
you'll

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,060
be Mrs. Qin.

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,750
You have nothing to do

24
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,800
with our Mo family.

25
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,110
Sister,

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,340
what do you mean?

27
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,740
I mean,

28
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,060
our sisterhood

29
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,840

30
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,380
Sister!

31
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,470
Have I done anything wrong?

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,870
I can correct my mistakes.

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,180
Have I done anything wrong?

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:38,710
No.

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,200
It's not your fault.

36
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,050

[Mo's Clinic]

38
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,590
Logically speaking,

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,610
I shouldn't meddle in your family affairs.

40
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,290
Then don't meddle.

41
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:21,960
Our father

42
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,390
took pains to open Mo's Clinic.

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,860
You can't just shut it down so easily.

44
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,790
If you don't want it,

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll take it over.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,720
That's our Mo family's clinic.

47
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,020
You're just an outsider.

48
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,680
Why should I give it to you?

49
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,310
So you just want to ruin

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,450

Don't be like this.

54
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,810
Don't ignore me as well.

55
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,870
Okay?

56
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,360
Mr. Qin,

please take your wife

Dr. Mo,

60
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,390
can I say something for Mo Banxia?

61
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,550
The master of the Mo Family has just passed away,

62
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,630
and you're treaing her like this.

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,950
That's inappropriate, right?

64
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,030

65
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,430

Time was limited.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,280
I could only ask the servants

74
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,530
to clean this room for you.

75
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,140
You can live here first.

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,360
Tell me if you need anything.

77
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,310
I'll buy it for you anytime.

78
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,750
Thank you, Young Master.

79
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,670
There is no Young Master.

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,580
This is the General's Mansion.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,430
There is no Young Master or Young Lady.

82
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,330
There's only the general and his wife.

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,290
You talked too much.

84
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,240
He talked too much.

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
Those who talk too much are donkeys.

86

It's my duty

87
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,640
to serve my wife.

88
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,880
You don't have to do these things.

89

Whether you take the medicine or not,

90
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
I won't be upset anymore.

91
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,870
No.

92
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,950
Look at my legs.

93
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,400
My legs have just recoverd.

94
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,110
Since when have you been able to walk again, Cousin?

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,050
Congratulations.

96
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,870
What a pity.

97
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,560
Though your legs have recovered,

98
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,790
the foundation of Qin's Medicine Shop

99
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,470

Look at you.

101
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,360
If you had cooperated with Prince An earlier,

102
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,720
you wouldn't have ended up

103
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,830
like this.

104
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,530
If you're willing to be someone else's running dog,

105
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,070
just bark at others.

106
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,620
Why are you making trouble here?

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,710
Listen.

108
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,710
This is my place.

109
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,110
Force him to drink it.

110
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,360
If you make trouble here again,

111
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,440
I'll make you regret it

112
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,190
every time you come.

113
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,660
Wait and see.

114
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,070
I'll come again next time.

115
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,860
Just wait!

116
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,830
Wait and see!

117
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,030
Will anything wrong happen to him?

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,400
It was just some medicine

119
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,390
that had been kept inside for a few days.

120
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,950
I think you're right.

121
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,590
I decocted the medicine.

122
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,350
It shouldn't be wasted.

123
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,620
I took that chance to make him drink it.

124
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,170
He'll only have diarrhea for a few days.

125
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,030
He won't die.

126
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,750
That's good.

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,150
Do this to him one more time.

128
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,350
-If he dares to come here...
-What's wrong with you?

129
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,360
Do you think I looked

130
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,550
very powerful just now?

131
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,120
From now on, every time he comes,

132
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,260
let's just force him to drink it, okay?

133
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,159
I...

134
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,990
I'll

135
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,000
force him to drink it.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,590
Okay.

137
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,510
Force him to drink it.

138
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,020
Force him to drink it!

139
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,290
Force him to drink it!

140
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:01,920
Okay.

141
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,620
I think you like eating it very much.

142
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,100
I should have made two more bowls of that.

143
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm just hungry.

144
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,630
Right.

145
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,640

149
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,430
When I saw that bad guy Chu,

150
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,140
I was so angry.

151
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,570
I finally understand that

152
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,010
I just can't let someone like that

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,870
have his way under any circumstances.

154
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,050
If you had figured it out earlier,

155
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,940
you wouldn't have been crippled for ten years.

156
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,060
Let me tell you a story.

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
When I was a kid,

158
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,350
I was gluttonous.

159
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,480
I insisted on eating the Dongpo pork

160
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,870
sold by a street stall.

161
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,880
I didn't expect that someone with ill intentions would poison me.

162
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,240
I was so lucky that

163
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,750
I merely got crippled,

164
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,750
and I survived.

165
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,490
But my parents and brothers

166
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,980
died on the spot because of the poison,

167
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,300
and they could never wake up again.

168
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,630
Sometimes I think

169
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,560
if I had not been gluttonous

170
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,910
when I was a kid,

171
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,280
would my family

172
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,590
have stayed alive?

173
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,500
That's why I refused to

174
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,370
treat my illness all the time

175
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,790
and didn't want to cure my leg disease.

176
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,250
I was afraid that if I stood up,

177
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,640
I wouldn't deserve my family's sacrifices.

178
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,110
The one who needs to say sorry to your parents

179
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,549

So,

182
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,640
I don't want to punish myself

183
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,200
in such an unnecessary way anymore.

184
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,690
I also hope that you can understand that

185
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,110
my father's death

186
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,370
was not your fault.

187

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,920
One packet.

193
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,790
Five-taste Powder...

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,550
Well, Banxia,

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,770
without you, it seems that

196
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,630
I'm not able to distinguish these herbs clearly.

197
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,080
I've worked for only a short while, but I'm so tired.

198
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,280
If you were the one working on this,

199
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,090
you would have

200
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,160
sorted them out very quickly.

201
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,650
What am I talking about?

202
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,640
I'll be responsible for doing

203
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,430
this kind of dirty work alone

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,450
from now on.

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,440
In that way, everything will go smoothly for you,

206
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,900
including this medicine.

207
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:37,910
I'll decoct it myself,

208
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,510
and drink it myself.

209
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,430
I promise that I won't distract you.

210
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,300
That's the medicine which was decocted the day before yesterday.

211
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,560
Even though it was decocted the day before yesterday,

212
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,550
as long as it was decocted by you, I'll drink it.

213
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,760
Are you out of your mind after your legs have recovered?

214
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,280
Why are you doing this?

215
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,100
I just want to make you happy.
