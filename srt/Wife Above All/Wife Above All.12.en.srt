[Episode 12]

4
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,310
Why did you open the city gate so early?

5
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,160
A fast horse went out of the city just now.

6
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,420
The riders showed the badge from Prince An's Mansion.

7
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,470
They must be the soldiers from Prince An's Mansion.

8
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,310
General!

9
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,380
I want to report something, General.

10
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:36,940
She's back?

11
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:37,950
Who?

12
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,030
Nothing.

13
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,870
Go ahead.

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,240
Just now, a team of soldiers from

15
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,000
Prince An's Mansion went out of the city.

16
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,910
I thought that there was something fishy about it,

17
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,509
so I came to report it to you.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,520
Prepare the horse.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,060
Open the city gate!

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,530
Open the city gate!

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,120
Mr. Mo!

22
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,190
I believe you can hear us.

23
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,050
We just want you to go back.

24
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,880
We won't hurt

25
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,150
you and your family.

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,510
There's no need to be so stubborn.

27
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,770
Let my family go

28
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,910
for four hours first.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,200
Then I'll go back with you to see your master.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,660
Mr. Mo,

31
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,370
don't be too selfish.

32
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,050
This

33
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,660
is your daughter.

34
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,630
In that case,

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,079
don't blame me for being rude.

36
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,320
Just go!

37
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,910
Banxia!

38
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,450
Father!

39
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,710
Father!

40
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,350
Father!

41
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,070
Father!

42
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,480
Sister.

43
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,430
How is our father?

44
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,150
Father.

45
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,150
I'm hungry.

46
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,130
I'll get you something to eat.

47
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,510
If my two daughters are safe,

48
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,350
I'll feel relieved.

49
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,470
My eldest son-in-law is a general.

50
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,770
He can protect people.

51
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,510
My second son-in-law is smart.

52
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,370
His legs have recovered after taking the medicine.

53
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,630
In the future,

54
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,410
both of you will have someone whom you can depend on.

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,460
Father.

56
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,600
Banxia.

57
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,630
When you were a kid,

58
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,080
you once followed me to pick herbs

59
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,830
in a place called Xihe Town.

60
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,160
Do you still remember that?

61
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,830
Father.

62
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,430
When I was a kid,

63
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,110
you took me to so many places.

64
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,240
How can I remember all of them?

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,430
You have to recover soon.

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,750
After you recover, you can continue to have a trip with me.

67
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,230
There's something

68
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,240
which I was going to tell you

69
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,190
when you got older.

70
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,380
Xihe Town is your hometown.

71
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,270
When you were a kid,

72
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,380
your home was robbed by some bandits.

73
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,830
Your parents risked their lives to protect you

74
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,950
and entrusted you to me.

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,060
Later,

76
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,970
you had a high fever,

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
and forgot the past.

78
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,060
That's why

79
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,870
you grew up carefreely.

80
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,909
Father.

81
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,480
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,390
Have you lost your mind because of the fever?

83
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,230
Originally,

84
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,710
there was a tattoo on your arm

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,540
which looked like a hedge leaf.

86
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,500
You were still young back then,

87
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,420
and you always rubbed the tattoo with your hand.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,520
I was afraid that after you grew up,

89
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,940
I would be unable to explain it to you,

90
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
so I removed it.

91
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,670
Father.

92
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,470
What are you talking about?

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,980
I don't believe what you said.

94
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,310
Not even a word.

95
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,760
I hid the pattern of that tattoo

96
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,310
in the prescription codex.

97
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,170
You must remember to

98
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,590
take it out and have a look.

99
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,720
You must remember to

100
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,350
take it out and have a look.

101
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,870
Are you dead or alive?

102
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,070
Is there hope for you to survive?

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Both you and Jingyu

104
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,800
are my beloved daughters.

105
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,540
But you are not my biological child after all.

106
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,680
I wanted to take you to look for

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,120
your family when you got older.

108
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,230
But in my eyes,

109
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,750
you can never grow up.

110
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,300
You just can't grow up.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
It's my fault.

112
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,940
I can't bear to leave you.

113
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:39,510
Father.

114
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,610
I won't leave.

115
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,000
I will always be your

116
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,630
second daughter who can never grow up.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,540
Jingyu.

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,180
You are the eldest sister.

119
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,630
When all the family members are together,

120
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,090
we should be of the same mind

121
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,980
so that those with evil intentions can't

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,270
take advantage of our weakness.

123
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,090
Both of you should remember that.

124
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,950
I've kept it in my mind.

125
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,390
Father.

126
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,720
Both of you have grown up.

127
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,540
I'm happy.

128
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,020
I'm happy!

129
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,350
Father!

130
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
No!

131
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,670
Father!

132
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,260
Father!

133
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,400
Father!

134
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,710
Father!

135
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:25,720
Father!

136
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,940
Father!

137
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
Father!

138
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,370
[Side Story]

139
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,190
What are you going to do next?

140
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,230
I don't know.

141
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,660
It depends on Mo Jingyu.

142
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,670
What about you?

143
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,060
Me?

144
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,590
I'll do the same as you.

145
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,870
It depends on Mo Banxia.

146
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,310
I've heard that

147
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,030
your cousin

148
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,290
has been ransomed.

149
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,650
Liu Zhengming even saved him personally.

150
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,000
Liu Zhengming is Noble Consort Liu's

151
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,190
elder brother.

152
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,150
He's also Prince An's uncle.

153
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,470
He usually likes to let others

154
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,700
call him

155
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,530
Duke openly.

156
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,390
My cousin

157
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,630
calls him that most proactively.

158
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,960
Then they won't

159
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,240
give you a hard time anymore, will they?

160
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,100
Qin's Medicine Shop has been shut down.

161
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,080
We also don't know

162
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,460
when Mo's Clinic can be run again.

163
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
What trouble can there be?

164
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,310
Why would they give me a hard time?

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,670
You're right.

166
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,830
This is not important.

167
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,810
What matters is that

168
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,610
on Mo Banxia's hand,

169
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,160
there was a tattoo which looked like a hedge leaf.

170
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,540
I really didn't expect that

171
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,000
after I married

172
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,640
this wife by drawing a lucky bag,

173
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,730
I actually had such a fate with her.

174
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,550
That's amazing.

175
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,510
Right. Even your legs have recovered.

176
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,400
I didn't expect that, either.

177
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,860
The point is

178
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,760
what we should do in the future.

179
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,990
What happened today

180
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,230
makes me feel that

181
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
the accident which occurred ten years ago

182
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
might not be related to Mo Xiang.

183
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,610
I want to find out about the truth

184
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,470
and give justice to Mo Xiang.
