[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,820
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,310
Mr. Qin,

5
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,680
you can't enter before I report.

6
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,950
Is it necessary to report?

7
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,950
Let him in.

8
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,110
Greetings, General Mo.

9
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,420
What kind of attitude is that?

10
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:32,930
That's enough.

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,750
Qin Chonglou.

12
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:34,990
Come here.

13
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,509
Let me beat you.

14
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,310
Seriously?

15
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,420
When did you become

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,950
like Yun?

17
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,789
This is for you.

18
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,140
To make this, I specially found the soldier who's best at drawing

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,470
in the army.

20
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,400
I don't want such an ugly duck.

21
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,940
This is a rabbit.

22
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,240
Rabbit?

23
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,720
Can't you see it?

24
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,920
There are two ears.

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,229
It's the mouth of a duck.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,460
It's a rabbit.

27
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,080
A duck.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,230
It must be because the painter in the army

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,400
is not good at drawing.

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,000
I made this.

31
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,800
I don't believe you.

32
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,930
Well,

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,860
you two look alike.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,150
Are you praising me again?

35
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,230
Take it.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,370
I'm just curious.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
You can just check the accounts.

38
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,120
Why did you make such a fuss?

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,360
I tried so hard

40
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,730
that Yun agreed to lend me the room.

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,560
This is the best room

42
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,270
in the military camp.

43
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,150
This?

44
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,050
I don't think it's grand enough.

45
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,890
Not grand enough?

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,780
Of course.

47
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,010
Who am I?

48
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm an account expert

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,350
in the capital.

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,870
Although there are so many account items,

51
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,100
as long as I have a clear mind,

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
I can find

53
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,030
the deficit account items immediately.

54
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,329
But

55
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,770
checking the accounts is just one thing.

56
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,680
If I don't make a fuss,

57
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,070
would the one who did it

58
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,079
be afraid?

59
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,250
Kill the chicken to scare the monkey?

60
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,400
Beat the grass to scare the snake.

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,910
Am I the chicken killed

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,140
or the grass beaten?

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,770
General...

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,310
Lower.

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,870
To a general,

66
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,520
the most important thing is strategy.

67
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,660
Every soldier

68
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,280
is needed

69
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,810
on the battlefield.

70
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,079
Check these again.

71
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,680
Then what are you gonna do?

72
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,780
I'm gonna supervise you.

73
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,910
Qin Chonglou, you two are really alike.

74
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,840
Why do they have the guts

75
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,510
to check the account book openly?

76
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,310
Why do they have the account book?

77
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,120
I didn't think Yun Zilong

78
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,640
could cause trouble with the account book.

79
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,470
But I didn't expect

80
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,900
that the two young ladies of the Mo family

81
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,090
are hard nuts to crack.

82
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,730
Even I

83
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,520
was almost poisoned to death by them.

84
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,800
Then go get the account book back.

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,680
Yes.

86
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,070
Your Highness, they made a big fuss

87
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,060
when checking the accounts.

88
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,960
I've sent a few batches of people

89
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,430
there.

90
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,070
But the place is heavily guarded.

91
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,190
I'm afraid in a few days,

92
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,200
His Majesty will know even if he doesn't want to know.

93
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,480
You've left me no choice.

94
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
Don't touch my account book.

95
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,790
I'll figure it out

96
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,900
in a few days.

97
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,590
By that time,

98
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,590
you can report

99
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,180
to His Majesty.

100
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,950
Prince An's crimes

101
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,150
will... will be disclosed.

102
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,280
The merit is mine.

103
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,880
You should share the merit

104
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,270
with the financial staff in the army.

105
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,990
I don't want to see that Prince An is fine

106
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,270
but you starve to death.

107
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:37,950
Okay?

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,590
General.

109
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,580
I'm here.

110
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,409
A plague broke out outside the camp.

111
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,720
The infected civilians

112
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,900
have come to the camp.

113
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,790
Plague?

114
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,409
Civilians?

115
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,870
Leave.

116
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,510
Stay away.

117
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,190
General.

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,710
General.

119
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,160
Tell me.

120
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:04,820
I've found out.

121
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,640
Someone put poison

122
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,910
in the well nearby.

123
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,520
The civilians were driven here.

124
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,260
But according to what they said,

125
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,480
those who drove them here

126
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,190
seem to be Prince An's men.

127
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,160
It's Prince An again.

128
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,100
He's trying to force me with the plague.

129
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,490
He's so vicious.

130
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,250
He even harmed the civilians.

131
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,890
Where is Mrs. Yun?

132
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,230
Mrs. Yun...

133
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,550
Mrs. Yun and Ms. Mo...

134
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,250
They... They...

135
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,159
If you ask me to leave,

136
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,909
don't expect

137
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:33,630
to see me again.

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,190
No matter what you want to do in the future,

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,430
go back right now.

140
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,290
Don't you remember

141
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,110
what I told you before?

142
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,390
Why did I stay?

143
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
I also care about

144
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,930
the safety of the soldiers and the civilians.

145
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,780
I will not

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,340
stay out of this.

147
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,450
Sister and I have been doctors for many years.

148
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,940
I will do my best

149
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,880
to protect myself.

150
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,670
Just trust us.

151
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,350
I knew I couldn't persuade you.

152
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,630
Is it beautiful?

153
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,330
Yes.

154
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,200
What do you think?

155
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,190
Am I handsome?

156
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:23,860
Very handsome.

157
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,539
When husband and wife are of one mind,

158
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,220
they can cut through metal.

159
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,010
Later,

160
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,600
I need to help my sister decoct medicinal herbs.

161
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,290
Right.

162
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,510
Tell this to the doctors who came with you.

163
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,590
Treating

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,010
the civilians

165
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,400
infected with the plague

166
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,120
will be included in their performance assessment in the military camp.

167
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,870
Later,

168
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,790
they will be rewarded according to their contributions.

169
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,110
Do you take the military camp

170
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,670
as your Medicated Diet Restaurant?

171
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,690
[Side Story]

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,490
Yun.

173
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,330
Is it hard to tell what this is?

174
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,300
It's not hard.

175
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,010
I can tell what it is right away.

176
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,360
That's right.

177
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,750
Mo Banxia insisted on saying

178
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,320
it's a duck...

179
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,580
Isn't it a duck?

180
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,060
It's a rabbit.

181
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
You made it?

182
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:40,810
When did you know how to make

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,230
such a girlish thing?

184
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,590
It's easy.

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,470
There are fireflies in the woods nearby.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,100
I'll put this lantern

187
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,590
in Mo Jingyu's room.

188
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,750
She's afraid of the dark at night.

189
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,180
With this,

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,890
she won't be afraid anymore.

191
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,990
Yun.

192
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,780
I want to...

193
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,390
Sit down.

194
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,870
