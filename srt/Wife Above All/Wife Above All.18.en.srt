[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,670
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,340
Take the navy

5
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,530
from Jiajiang

6
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,190
through here.

7
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,510
Your Highness.

8
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,960
It's getting cold.

9
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,880
Let's go back and rest.

10
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,840
It's the Mo family again.

11
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
How dare they make trouble openly?

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,530
Who gave them the guts?

13
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,930
Who else could it be?

14
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,500
The Mo family

15
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
has General Yun Zilong

16
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,390
as the son-in-law.

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,450
You mean...

18
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,550
This is Yun Zilong's idea?

19
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,260
What else?

20
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,590
Look.

21
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,150
Mo sisters

22
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,910
are women.

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Could they do such a thing?

24
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,130
Looks like

25
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,240
they're going against Prince An undisguisedly.

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
At the palace banquet in a few days,

27
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,360
I'm going to check with

28
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,140
Ms. Mo.

29
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm afraid she'll accuse Prince An by then.

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,720
The death of Mr. Mo

31
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,290
is somehow

32
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,829
a good reason for them.

33
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,650
How dare she!

34
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,890
My son has made great contributions

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
to His Majesty.

36
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,460
A general is not in the same league as him.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,690
Your Highness, so regarding Yun Zilong,

38
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,340
are you planning to...

39
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,930
How dare he obstruct Prince An's development?

40
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,970
I must find a way

41
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,130
to get rid of him.

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,550
Rinse it off.

43
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,810
It does look scary.

44
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,990
Young Mistress.

45
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Even with the money given by General Yun

46
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,360
and Mr. Qin,

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,950
everything is expensive now.

48
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,190
How long can those ingredients last?

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,420
Look at you.

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
You only serve him alone today,

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,420
offering discounts and drinks.

52
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,190
He's going to ruin the restaurant.

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,080
He finally

54
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,400
came all the way here.

55
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,730
We've promised him.

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,500
We must keep our promise.

57
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,950
After today,

58
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,880
I wonder if our restaurant

59
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,149
can still be open.

60
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,560
It's not easy to have someone

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,070
who knows so much about our food.

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,780
Consider it a wrap-up

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,700
for our restaurant.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,990
Won't the food be wasted?

65
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,050
I think we should

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,740
pack the dishes

67
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,390
and distribute them to the residents nearby

68
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,320
in the evening.

69
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,070
Yes.

70
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,330
We delivered takeout before.

71
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,200
Let's not operate the restaurant anymore,

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,170
but the delivery.

73
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,530
Lu Rong.

74
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,230
Go and ask

75
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,180
if any of our regular customers

76
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,190
is willing

77
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,330
to take orders like ours.

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,040
What are you waiting for? Go.

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,680
Uncle Cheng,

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,010
I'll give you another pot of wine.

81
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,040
You must not

82
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,990
forget us after this.

83
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,930
Next time, if you want a medicated diet,

84
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,260
we'll deliver it to your doorstep.

85
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,900
That's great.

86
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,300
Sister,

87
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,280
do you lack herbs too?

88
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,110
The mother and son

89
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,720
came from the countryside

90
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,210
and walked for two nights.

91
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,070
But

92
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,320
I really have no money

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,150
to buy herbs.

94
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,110
The Chamber of Commerce asks for a high commission rate now.

95
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,670
If this continues,

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,190
let alone treating patients,

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,260
even this clinic

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
can't be maintained.

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,700
Sister,

100
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,430
how about I shut down the Medicated Diet Restaurant?

101
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,360
Our Mo family's business

102
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,510
can't be ruined just like that.

103
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,270
Sister,

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,440
do you remember

105
00:05:58,470 --> 00:05:59,350
what Father said?

106
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,400
There are many nobles in the capital,

107
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,260
but there are more poor than the nobles.

108
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,780
They couldn't find a way to treat themselves.

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,850
With Mo's Clinic,

110
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,240
at least they have

111
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,270
a way.

112
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,860
But now we can hardly survive.

113
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,000
Medicated Diet Restaurant

114
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,990
suffers loss every day.

115
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,200
It's really hard for me

116
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,700
to do as Father said.

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,890
Sister,

118
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,100
do you want to listen to Father?

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Treat patients and save lives. Help the poor and those in danger.

120
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,010
Miss.

121
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,870
-You came at the right time.
-Miss.

122
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,520
The mother and son

123
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,710
have almost recovered.

124
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,680
Send the medicine

125
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,470
to them.

126
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,870
Remember to ask them to eat on time.

127
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,880
Miss,

128
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,760
this is no time

129
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,870
to think of it.

130
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,350
What's wrong?

131
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,550
Something happened.

132
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,080
Our men had a fight

133
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,670
with the fighters of the Chamber of Commerce at the wharf.

134
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,040
Lu Rong said

135
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,950
the path they took was not under the Chamber of Commerce.

136
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,220
They were reluctant to pay the money.

137
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,680
Not only did Chu Dezhao and his gang

138
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,590
beat Lu Rong,

139
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,910
but they also colluded with the officials

140
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,290
and put him in jail.

141
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,820
He was arrested?

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,600
But only Lu Rong was caught.

143
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,590
Ms. Mo is fine.

144
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,270
His Majesty said

145
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,330
ten days later,

146
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,530
His Majesty and Her Highness

147
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,190
would go relax at the royal residence.

148
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,540
The wife of Marquis Zhenxi is invited

149
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,610
to go with them.

150
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,440
Invite me?

151
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,070
Her Highness said

152
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,060
Marquis Zhenxi is far away on the frontline.

153
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,780
So, she needs to take good care of his wife

154
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,220
so that Marquis Zhenxi can have no worries.

155
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll obey the decree then.

156
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,140
Get up. Go back to the palace.

157
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,510
Miss.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,940
Sister!

159
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,680
You can't go.

160
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,520
She invited you to the royal residence

161
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,710
and mentioned General Yun.

162
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,520
Either she's using you as her stepping stone

163
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,110
or to threaten General Yun.

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,909
I know.

165
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,530
At this point,

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,450
I can only go and check it out.

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,890
I'll go with you.

168
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,440
If His Majesty punishes you,

169
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,650
I'll be there with you.

170
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,370
His Majesty only summoned me.

171
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Wait for me at home.

172
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,800
His Majesty only asked to suppress the rebellion.

173
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,390
[Side Story]

174
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,990
I can go alone.

175
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,400
You just recovered.

176
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,430
If you're on the battlefield,

177
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,090
can you carry a knife?

178
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,520
Even if I'm not a soldier,

179
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,590
I can be a doctor.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,510
A sick young man is not welcome in the army.

181
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,120
Who said he's sick?

182
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,980
Who said he's a sick young man?

183
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,350
Stop looking.

184
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,840
Sister doesn't want to come.

185
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,500
General Yun.

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,140
Are you despising

187
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,090
Mo's Clinic?

188
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,309
No.

189
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,150
So you don't like my father?

190
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,150
No.

191
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,679
How can the patient my father cured

192
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,870
still sick

193
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,210
by now?

194
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,360
He has never been to the battlefield.

195
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,070
How would I know his capability?

196
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,030
Then, give him a chance.

197
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,770
Tell me, what is the test?

198
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,530
Bravo!

199
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,210
Bravo!

200
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:35,600
Fine.

201
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,740
If you insist,

202
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,450
suit yourself.

203
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,740
Why are you defending me?

204
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,220
You and General Yun spoke for us

205
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,050
in front of His Majesty.

206
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,310
So Sister and I

207
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,550
could get out of the prison.

208
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't want to owe you that favour

209
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,510
for too long.

210
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,550
What do you mean?

211
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,030
If you say that,

212
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,110
I owe you more than you do.

213
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,240
That's good.

214
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,880
Now we

215
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,020
are in peace.

216
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,680
Yes.

217
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,340
Good.
