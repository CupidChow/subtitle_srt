[Episode 4]

4
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,990
A live-in son-in-law should follow...

5
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,830
Master.

6
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,229
Miss Jingyi said

7
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,430
you should rest early.

8
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,630
You don't have to attend on her in bed today.

9
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,030
The clinic is very busy.

10
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,610
Why didn't she tell me earlier?

11
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,030
To attend on her in bed?

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,870
Who attends on whom?

13
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,430
It’s late.

14
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,930
The live-in son-in-law shouldn’t walk around.

15
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,370
Why can’t I?

16
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,760
It's not that easy

17
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,230
to lock me, General Zhenyuan up.

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,920
This is my newly married wife.

19
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,050
Banxia.

20
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,280
Are you here to greet me?

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,140
You are so polite.

22
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,730
It's fine if you think so.

23
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,030
We just want to

24
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,790
-talk to you...
-To talk about family issues

25
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,560
and make emotional communications.

26
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,070
Cousin-in-law.

27
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,760
Although

28
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,250
this is the first time I've seen you,

29
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,590
I think

30
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,060
you are very kind.

31
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,140
You are not old.

32
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,060
But you already have gray hair.

33
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,079
You must be exhausted by

34
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,930
Qin's Medicine Shop.

35
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,030
Don't worry.

36
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,590
I'm here today.

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,390
I will

38
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,260
help you in the future.

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,750
It's improper for men and women to have physical contact.

40
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,690
What are you doing?

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,270
Cousin-in-law, you're so polite.

42
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,230
Since

43
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm sitting on this chair,

44
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,630
Cousin-in-law,

45
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,910
you can take a rest.

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,630
You're messing around.

47
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,040
You are smart.

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,360
I like to mess around.

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,140
If you come any closer,

50
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,820
I'll burn this place down.

51
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,150
You're crazy.

52
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,310
Qin Chonglou.

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,870
I've treated you well.

54
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,680
I haven't taken anything that should have been given to you.

55
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,010
Are you trying to rob me?

56
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,260
Your surname is Chu.

57
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,560
This place is surnamed Qin.

58
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,890
We want to take back a house that belongs to the Qin family.

59
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,700
Is it robbing from you who surnamed Chu?

60
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,840
That's right!

61
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,829
Cousin.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,500
My wife means

63
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,560
that

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
she doesn't want to cause trouble

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,510
for outsiders to come in and out.

66
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,630
So please

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,840
move out.

68
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,950
Move out?

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,600
Do you think suddenly pressuring me

70
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,510
will succeed?

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,190
With your health condition,

72
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,510
you won't be able to live without me.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,880
Of course, he can live.

74
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,540
Mo's Clinic

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,530
still has some money.

76
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,510
Besides...

77
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,430
Besides,

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,350
Cousin, you...

79
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,960
You asked those people to make a scene

80
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,260
at the Mo's Clinic.

81
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,050
Banxia...

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,020
I haven't talked

83
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,420
to you about this.

84
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,370
Write a commitment

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,270
saying you will move out and return the house to the Qin family.

86
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,190
Of course,

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,820
you need also to return the business.

88
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,460
I made dozens of copies of this.

89
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
If you like it,

90
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,470
I have enough.

91
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,180
You're amazing.

92
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,409
How about

93
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,820
I rename the Qin's Mansion

94
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,610
into Mo's Mansion

95
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,670
and I continue to be a live-in son-in-law?

96
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,480
This old house is long neglected.

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,140
It's not worth it.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,560
Then what do you want?

99
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,610
Look. Article one.

100
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Funds specifically for medical treatment.

101
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,820
This is what I want.

102
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,580
You want me to treat my legs?

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,390
Then you'd better give up.

104
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,250
No need to

105
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,030
treat my legs.

106
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,720
You're talking nonsense!

107
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not.

108
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,210
Are you out of your mind?

109
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,140
You are

110
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,100
my husband in name.

111
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,670
If the highly reputed Mo's Clinic

112
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,670
collaborates with the biggest herbal merchant,

113
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,470
Qin's Medicine Shop,

114
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,490
and you still fail to recover,

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,150
it will tarnish your reputation

116
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,420
and affect my business.

117
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,140
Don't worry about it.

118
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,680
Leave your body to me.

119
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,380
Deal.

120
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,720
Deal.

121
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,500
That night,

122
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,400
we scared Chu Quede away.

123
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,710
But

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,250
those two criminals

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,330
disappeared mysteriously.

126
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,620
Without witnesses,

127
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,730
the testimony becomes useless.

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,770
Hang in there.

129
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,930
Your unscrupulous cousin,

130
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,450
because of fearing the Mo family,

131
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,150
honored the promise

132
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,400
and granted you the management rights

133
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,230
of several shops.

134
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,960
But they're all small pharmaceutical studios

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
that are about to close down.

136
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,710
It's good to have them.

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,550
Haven't we already taken

138
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,080
two major steps towards reclaiming

139
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,070
the Qin family's businesses?

140
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,510
A few days ago,

141
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,070
I ordered a batch of herbs.

142
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,380
They're rare in the capital.

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,790
I should be able to make a profit.

144
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,800
Young Master.

145
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,310
What's wrong?

146
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,300
Young Master.

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,510
The herbs we ordered

148
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,360
suffered a heavy rain.

149
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,720
Half of them were damaged.

150
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,110
What?

151
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,470
[Side Story]

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,990
Are you sure

153
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,150
this method can cure my leg disease?

154
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,080
No.

155
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,430
It has something to do with how long you can live.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,920
What do you mean?

157
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:58,200
Last night, I checked

158
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,550
your pulse.

159
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,280
It was really weird.

160
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,390
When did you check

161
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,420
my pulse?

162
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,510
It doesn't matter.

163
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,680
-It does.
-It doesn't.

164
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,890
-It does.
-Don’t interrupt me.

165
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,090
Your pulse was stable.

166
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,970
It didn't indicate that you have a serious illness.

167
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,540
Somebody with concealed pulse patterns like yours

168
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,900
will silently experience physical depletion.

169
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,520
If you are not strong,

170
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,800
you'll suffer a severe disease

171
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,030
and bleed to death.

172
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,110
Before I die,

173
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,720
will I be able to see you help me retrieve

174
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,350
the Qin family's property and glory?

175
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,690
It's hard to say about the glory.

176
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,510
But I have an 80% chance to take back the property.
