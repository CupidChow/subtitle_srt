[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,490
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,350
Well...

5
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,570
What should we do?

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
This is perfect, Young Master.

7
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,560
The bride ran away.

8
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,710
You should run too.

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,210
With my physical condition,

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,400
where can I go?

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,110
At this point,

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,950
we can only start Plan B.

13
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,200
Plan B?

14
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,670
Yun Zilong doesn't want to be a live-in son-in-law.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,610
When he gets to the Mo family,

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
he will make a scene

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,979
and cause trouble in the backyard.

18
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,789
He and Miss Mo Jingyu will definitely be against each other.

19
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:39,990
Do you want to

20
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,150
marry Miss Mo Jingyi

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,150
as well?

22
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,400
You will serve both ladies?

23
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,340
I can't

24
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,370
serve so many people.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,100
How would I know?

26
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,229
I'm wondering

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,110
if I can help Mo Banxia

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,100
to be the head of the family.

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,860
If she becomes rich,

30
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,200
even if I can't earn the commission,

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,950
it'll be nothing.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
His Majesty mentioned

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,770
that if you become the live-in son-in-law,

34
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,310
I have to keep an eye on you.

35
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,520
The Imperial Sword.

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,790
I will faithfully obey His Majesty's wishes.

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,680
I worked so hard

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,670
for so long,

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,540
not only did I not become the live-in son-in-law of the Mo family,

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,710
but now the bride

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,880
ran away.

42
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,140
No way.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,380
I must

44
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,170
find you.

45
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,190
Mr. Gao.

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,530
Back then,

47
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,170
I found

48
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,320
the best Fo-ti

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,180
for your tea shop.

50
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,790
In the end,

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,940
you only give me such little dividends.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,180
My dear Miss Mo Banxia.

53
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,610
If you don't believe me,

54
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,960
you can take a closer look.

55
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,470
Seeing

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,960
may not be true.

57
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,680
Take a closer look.

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,510
Is the boss considering a day's profit

59
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,350
as if

60
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,220
it were a month's profit?

61
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,460
The amount is right.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,520
Qin's Medicine Shop is

63
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,950
one of the best in the capital.

64
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,590
As my wife,

65
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,410
shouldn't you improve

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,070
your financial management skills?

67
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:08,830
Maybe

68
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,630
it’s not bad to be a live-in son-in-law.

69
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,470
Anyway, I’m a general.

70
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,970
If I don't call myself a live-in son-in-law,

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,620
no one can call me that.

72
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,670
Judging from your wedding dress,

73
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,930
your sense of aesthetics

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,250
is a bit worrisome.

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,510
But it's okay.

76
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,590
I can give you some advice.

77
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,310
As long as you do as I say,

78
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,770
I promise the people in the capital

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,250
will not doubt whether an illegitimate daughter of the Mo family

80
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,350
can manage the Qin family's backyard.

81
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,150
You...

82
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,190
What do you want to say?

83
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,690
You're good.

84
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,350
I know.

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,190
As I expected,

86
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,350
you are not that good.

87
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,480
The husband is the guide for the wife.

88
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,870
It's inappropriate for you to say that.

89
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm General Zhenyuan.

90
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,830
Now you're a live-in son-in-law of my Mo family.

91
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,670
Since ancient times,

92
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,170
there is no reason for a general to be a live-in son-in-law.

93
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
Then you may leave.

94
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,920
Mr. Qin.

95
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,630
Just call me Qin.

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,590
Qin.

97
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,700
I'll break down your wording.

98
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
From the very beginning, you claimed

99
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,550
that your Qin's Medicine Shop is one of the best in the capital.

100
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,560
Then

101
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,480
you belittled my financial management skills.

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,300
You also

103
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,870
criticized my wedding dress.

104
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
The funniest thing was

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,590
you told me

106
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,710
to do as you say.

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,130
Obviously,

108
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,940
you want to control me.

109
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,230
What?

110
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,390
Did I force you to be a live-in son-in-law?

111
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,370
Did I

112
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,510
force you to marry me?

113
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,330
You don’t want to be a live-in son-in-law.

114
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
But you had bad luck.

115
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,960
It's because you

116
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,790
didn't draw a satisfactory lucky bag yourself.

117
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,580
Why are you trying to assert your general's authority over me?

118
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,670
Either

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
you leave my family now

120
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,670
or

121
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,210
behave well

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,730
as a live-in son-in-law of my family.

123
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,620
What do you mean?

124
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,140
If I didn't help you just now,

125
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,460
you would have been fooled

126
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,050
by that shopkeeper.

127
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,390
That shopkeeper has

128
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,700
fooled me many times.

129
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,390
I pretended to be a fool today.

130
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,230
I was waiting for him

131
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,710
to deliver the ledger.

132
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,750
Look at you.

133
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,130
You acted like you were smart.

134
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,530
You made me gain less.

135
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,020
I didn't expect you to be so smart.

136
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,440
Oh my gosh!

137
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,940
Why did I marry you?

138
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,440
I wanted to marry General Yun.

139
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,280
In that way, I will have the authority to purchase herbs

140
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,190
for the military.

141
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,260
Is this the only thing you consider about marriage?

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,360
What else?

143
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Do I know you?

144
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,530
She's actually this type.

145
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,600
If I weren't afraid of affecting

146
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,510
the operation of the clinic,

147
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,590
who wants to marry you?

148
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,630
What do you mean?

149
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,990
What does she mean?

150
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,400
Miss Jingyi.

151
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,260
It's time for the wedding.

152
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,150
No need.

153
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,350
The marriage is granted by His Majesty.

154
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,750
It's a rare chance.

155
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,909
You guys can bring honor

156
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,390
to your ancestors.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,890
How can you skip

158
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,110
the formal wedding procedure?

159
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,470
Mr. Wen.

160
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,830
It's publicly announced

161
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,640
that General Yun is a live-in son-in-law

162
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,780
of our family.

163
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,250
Don't worry

164
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,390
about his status not being

165
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,409
appropriate in our Mo family.

166
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,280
What status?

167
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,240
What are you talking about?

168
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,180
I have something else to do.

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,150
I have to go.

170
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,340
By the way,

171
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,830
General Yun,

172
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,740
you got injured while chiseling ice just now.

173
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,070
You should get treatment as soon as possible.

174
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,980
The medicine in the red bottle is for internal use.

175
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,860
While the one in the white bottle is for external applications.

176
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,900
I'm a doctor,

177
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,900
so I kindly remind you.

178
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,960
Which one is for internal use? Which one is for external applications?

179
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,400
[Side Story]

180
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,870
Are you not used to

181
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,400
with the Mo family?

182
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,710
You have no choice.

183
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,159
Didn’t I

184
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,120
lend the notes from the Live-in Son-in-law Academy

185
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,020
to you?

186
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,090
Understand

187
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,830
and digest it.

188
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,330
Tenderness

189
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,980
is the root of a man,

190
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,510
compliance

191
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,900
is his essence,

192
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,670
virtue

193
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,980
is his morality,

194
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
and benevolence

195
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,200
is his code of conduct.

196
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,030
Our goal

197
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,360
is to serve our wife for the rest of our lives.

198
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,580
You memorized it well.

199
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,540
What's the use?

200
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,590
She won't come back.

201
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,410
I miss my wife.

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,800
What about you?

203
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,170
I don't miss mine.
