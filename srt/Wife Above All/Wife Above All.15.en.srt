00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,500
Welcome to the Medicated Diet Restaurant.

00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,600
A serving of Mo Comes Again

7
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,270
keeps you healthy all the time.

Mo's Clinic

10
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,270
will only treat ordinary people in the future.

11
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,600
Isn't this a slap in the face

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,789
for Prince An?

13
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,270
If Prince An

14
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,670
really comes to us and gives us a hard time,

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,500
is the powder we prepared

16
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,229
enough?

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,110
Yes.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,190
But I'm afraid that

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,830
before we take out the medicine,

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,800
Prince An has already

21
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,979
taken out his weapon.

22
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,640
But then again, why would you want to open

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,750
a medicated diet restaurant?

24
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,710
I thought

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,190
you would go to Xihe Town.

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,950
I mean,

27
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,870
if you want to find your family,

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,680
I can accompany you

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,470
so that you won't be bored alone.

30
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,789
Maybe I'll find my family

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,480
in Xihe Town.

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,450
But for me,

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,270
that's a far future.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,880
If I can't even live in peace

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,949
with the family I own now,

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,050
how can I be at ease?

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,270
Besides,

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,770
I've figured it out.

39
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,030
We

40
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,510
should have our own things to do.

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,590
In this way,

42
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,940
no matter what happens in the future,

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,190
we still have our own assets, right?

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,310
Right.

45
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,470
We can't let them look down on us.

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,150

Why not?

and ask for ten prostitutes

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,830
Go!

197
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,470
Go!

198
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,409
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

199
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,600
You two look unfamiliar.

200
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,350
Is this your first time here?

201
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,400
Who says it's my first time?

202
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm an acquaintance here.

203
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,750
-I know you very well.
-Let me introduce

204
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,930
our top star to you.

205
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,670
Please.

206
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,159
Wait, I...

207
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,070
I can't.

208
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,370
Sister.

209
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,050
You're here.

210
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,110
Amazing.

211
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,550
Brother-in-law has improved recently.

212
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Every now and then,

213
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,390
he puts some effort into changing your mood.

214
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,220
It's no big deal.

215
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,510
I heard that my brother-in-law

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,540
is more outstanding

217
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
than other husbands.

218
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,430
He listens to every word of you.

219
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,090
If he were more practical

220
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
like Brother-in-law

221
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,580
and could make more money, that would be great.

222
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,050
Take your time.

223
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,440
If he values you,

224
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,400
he will think of you.

225
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,810
If he doesn't,

226
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,950
we can live well

227
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,070
relying on ourselves.

228
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,750
Right?

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,560
You're right.

230
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,590
Where is Qin?

231
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,920
Didn't he say that Brother-in-law was looking for him?

232
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
Didn't he ask Zilong

233
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,419
to help him?

234
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,500
So many girls

235
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,419
sprang on us all of a sudden.

236
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,080
You said you took me there to have some fun,

237
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,850
but

238
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,190
you ran faster than me.

239
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,540
How dare you say that to me?

240
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,030
When those girls...

241
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
When those girls tried to intoxicate you with wine,

242
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,130
one cup after another,

243
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,400
you were so scared that you almost jumped out of the window.

244
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,990
How dare you say that?

245
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,970
What are you doing?

246
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,510
Wait for me.

247
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,140
He took me there.

248
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,110
Where did you go?

249
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,250
That... brothel.

250
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,600
Yun Zilong.

251
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,240
Actually,

252
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,570
it's not a bad place

253
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,880
for you to go.

254
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,630
Others don't know

255
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,710
our relationship.

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
I know.

257
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,970
As a man,

258
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,400
you should have some fun.

259
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,910
Right?

260
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,470
Stop it.

261
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Why are you yelling at me?

262
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,630
I mean...

263
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,640
I mean...

264
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,850
I'll go get some water.

265
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll clean it later.

266
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,830
We had an agreement.

267
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,380
50-50 will do.

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,040
No.

269
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,130
These are all for you.

270
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,250
Are you sure?

271
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,120
Including the cash,

272
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,530
some

273
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,620
receipts and IOUs.

274
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,290
By then,

275
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,440
I'll give them all to you.

276
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,830
From now on, you'll be

277
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,230
taking over the Qin family, okay?

278
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,170
By the way,

279
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,440
my mother left me

280
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,320
some jewellery too.

281
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,550
But my legs caused me

282
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,600
the difficulty of getting around.

283
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,350
Please go and pick it up

284
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,150
when the time comes.

285
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,490
I won't take a single bit of it.

286
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:06,990
Fine.

287
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,950
I won't go to

288
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,940
that kind of boring place anymore.

289
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,490
Your mother's belongings

290
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,500
are... all mine now?

291
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,240
He's indeed wealthy.

292
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,190
Sister,

293
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,830
tell me.

294
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,640
What should a married couple

295
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,980
be like?

296
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,310
Should it be like you and Brother-in-law?

297
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,870
He...

298
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,800
I think

299
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,920
it should be like you

300
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,670
and your husband.

301
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,860
He

302
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,990
is not very typical.

303
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,320
[Side Story]

304
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,190
How's it going?

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,810
Are you okay?

306
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,990
To be honest,

307
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,730
I feel relieved.

308
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,280
Although she didn't say anything,

309
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,870
after I cleaned

310
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,420
the clinic thoroughly,

311
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,970
she cooled down a lot.

312
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,890
You know what? Same here.

313
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,670
After I gave her

314
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,370
all our family property,

315
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,810
she turned â€Žecstatic immediately.

316
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,990
If we knew this would

317
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,230
please them,

318
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,990
why would we bother then?

319
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,450
I remember

320
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,870
what we did

321
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,500
mentioned in "How to Be a Live-in Son-In-Law."

322
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,350
Look.

323
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:40,940
Is it mentioned?

324
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,650
Right?

325
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,150
That's right.

326
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,860
Sir is indeed a wise man.

327
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,400
When a man goes out,

328
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,160
he should obey his wife's orders

329
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,660
and listen to her.

330
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,950
On his wife's birthday,

331
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,170
remember to play horses with her...

332
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,150
Horseplay.

333
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,060
-Horseplay.
-He should allow his wife to spend money as she wishes.

334
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,790
Be generous.

335
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,010
He shouldn't dress too fan...

336
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,070
fancy and exposed?

337
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,820
And revealing.

338
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,310
Can you read?

339
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,860
I'm a general.

340
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,530
If a man is not yet married, he should keep his chastity

341
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,690
and uphold masculine virtues,

342
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,870
only then...

343
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,110
Shan.

344
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,730
It's pronounced as "Shan."

345
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,300
I know this character.
