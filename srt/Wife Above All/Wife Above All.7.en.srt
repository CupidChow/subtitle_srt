[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,650
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,030
Young Master!

5
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,350
Young Master.

6
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,350
Who is it?

7
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,950
Young Master.

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,430
Isn't this Mr. Jin?

9
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,920
Why is he here?

10
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,310
Young Master.

11
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,690
Mr. Jin.

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,650
Iâ€™ve brought him.

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,950
Make way.

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,710
Make way.

15
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,950
Kneel!

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:21,789
Kneel!

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,550
Kneel!

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,150
Stop!

19
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,750
Why force him to kneel?

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,710
Does it have something to do with him?

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,430
In the second half,

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,380
you, the head of the Qin family,

23
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,060
should show your strength.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,170
Mr. Jin.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,490
Many witnesses said

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,240
the evidence, ginseng,

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,710
was bought from your shop.

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,770
Is it true?

29
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,030
Yes.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,370
He gave me the medicine himself.

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,000
Brick.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,270
I...

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,600
Sir,

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,759
don't rush.

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,979
Mr. Jin has been working in Qin's Medicine Shop for many years.

36
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,280
I trust his personality

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,250
and capability.

38
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,180
Mr. Jin.

39
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,350
Did other clerks in the store

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,390
change the medicine?

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,520
If I catch that guy,

42
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,720
I will bring him to justice

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,190
and chop him into pieces

44
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,570
even if I will lose all my money.

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,520
Master.

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,539
Don't wrongly accuse me.

47
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,510
It was Mr. Jin.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,680
He mixed the wet goods

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,850
into our own warehouse.

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,200
He also stole high-quality ginseng

51
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,130
and sold them.

52
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,280
You're slandering me!

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,630
I swear to God.

54
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,480
Mr Jin has

55
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,190
a new mistress.

56
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,579
He even asked me to send his mistress

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,800
pocket money last month.

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,150
He even offered a fake price

59
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,950
and got kickbacks.

60
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,550
He provided you with counterfeit accounts.

61
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,450
If you're just embezzling money,

62
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,020
a few beatings

63
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,630
or at worst exile will suffice.

64
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,480
But if the herbs caused someone's death,

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,840
your life will be demanded.

66
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,710
Alright,

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,630
Please

68
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,390
leave today.

69
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,690
Thank you all for your hard work.

70
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,360
Young Master, Young Mistress.

71
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,210
Weâ€™re leaving.

72
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,750
Let's go.

73
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,750
Wait.

74
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,800
These people seem suspicious.

75
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,700
Stop them!

76
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,130
Are you trying to apprehend people from my Qin family?

77
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
Do you have any evidence?

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,520
Qin's people?

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,830
Qin Chonglou.

80
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,310
They are your people?

81
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,730
What's wrong, Cousin?

82
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,280
The caravan manager has been delivering goods for Qin's Medicine Shop

83
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,460
for more than ten years.

84
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,670
They mostly operate in the northwest and rarely come to the capital.

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,510
Cousin, you're usually very busy.

86
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,380
You can't recognize everyone,

87
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,030
it's normal.

88
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,450
My husband

89
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,090
invited him to play a part in our little drama.

90
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,610
Do you have a problem?

91
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,750
Darling.

92
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,780
Do you think my nails look nice?

93
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,790
He didn't dispose

94
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,800
of this batch of herbs

95
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,060
but intended to mix them into normal herbs

96
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:44,840
to keep selling.

97
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,620
Where do you think

98
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,170
these herbs came from,

99
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
and who suggested this?

100
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,730
Are you implying

101
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,880
someone is guiding him from behind?

102
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,500
We need to figure out a way

103
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,100
to lure out the mastermind.

104
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,840
Chu Quede.

105
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,550
Do you understand?

106
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,550
Officer.

107
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,150
Thank you for coming.

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
We knew there was something wrong

109
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,750
with our herbs.

110
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,430
We were afraid the evidence might get destroyed,

111
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,190
so

112
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,610
we staged this act

113
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,870
hoping to expose the mole.

114
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,390
We didn't expect

115
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,900
my cousin-in-law to misunderstand

116
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,590
and report it to the government.

117
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,010
Officer, you've made the trip for nothing.

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,100
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,160
Officer,

120
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,279
you can't just believe

121
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,070
their side of the story.

122
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,630
It must be Qin Chonglou

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,440
using his position as the manager,

124
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,790
teaming up with the shop assistants,

125
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,340
and shifting all the blame

126
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,230
onto Mr. Jin.

127
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,950
You need to arrest these two

128
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,960
and interrogate them thoroughly.

129
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,100
You'll surely extract something.

130
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,659
Cousin-in-law, since you don't want to leave,

131
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,220
I have another matter

132
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,270
to ask about.

133
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,110
When they were making a scene,

134
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,310
they said the herbs were spoiled,

135
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,400
but didn't

136
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,590
specify how.

137
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,360
How did you know

138
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,060
the herbs were tainted with ink?

139
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,870
That's because...

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,640
You two colluded to deceive me, didn't you?

141
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,530
The two of them conspired and staged this,

142
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,610
conniving together.

143
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,210
Both of your statements make sense.

144
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm only responsible for arresting,

145
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,830
not for investigating.

146
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,600
So, I'll take all of you back and

147
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,080
hand you over to the master for a personal interrogation.

148
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,190
Who dares to move?

149
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,050
The soldiers are here!

150
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,220
Move! Move!

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,760
Make way.

152
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,360
Such a big scene.

153
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,380
Is it that serious?

154
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,030
Yeah.

155
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,150
Why did the soldiers come?

156
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,980
It's quite intimidating

157
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,150
Interesting.

158
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,510
Feeling outnumbered, huh?

159
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,840
I didn't expect

160
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,860
you would come today.

161
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,030
I told you

162
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,990
I can't stand seeing ordinary people

163
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,680
being bullied.

164
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,520
Originally, my two daughters managed

165
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,950
the clinic well.

166
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,380
But after they married you two,

167
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,990
one moment they were involved in a commotion,

168
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,070
the next they were almost in a lawsuit.

169
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,159
Are you both jinxes?

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,590
Are you both jinxes?

171
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,470
Father-in-law.

172
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,300
This is from our Qin's Medicine Shop, right?

173
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,820
Just because of your herbs,

174
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,330
my second daughter almost got into trouble.

175
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,230
Do you know that?

176
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,670
Father.

177
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,270
We burned the spoiled herbs.

178
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
If my daughters suffered,

179
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,230
it's because of you as their husband.

180
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,790
I...

181
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,120
I didn't feel like I suffered.

182
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,010
If it hurts my heart, it means you've suffered.

183
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,040
And you.

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,470
Have you suffered too?

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
She has suffered too.

186
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,070
Tonight,

187
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,110
check these herbs

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,800
bag by bag.

189
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,400
If you don't check thoroughly,

190
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,590
none of you will sleep tonight,

191
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,290
except for my two daughters

192
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,470
I won't.

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,320
What did you say?

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,630
I don't know how to check herbs.

195
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,040
Since you do, check them carefully and make sure you're right.

196
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,400
Mistaken herbs

197
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,500
could kill someone.

198
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,100
Hold on.

199
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,680
Eat before you go.

200
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,320
Sister.

201
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,530
General Yun treated Father like that.

202
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,420
You have to talk to him.

203
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,900
I don't want to care about him.

204
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,990
I'll go back first.

205
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,590
Qin.

206
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,920
My father scolded you just now.

207
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,750
Bear with it.

208
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,030
Don't be mad at him.

209
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,810
He's helping us

210
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,560
check the Qin family's herbs.

211
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,490
Why should I be angry?

212
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,780
Am I even human?

213
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,680
Qin is such a good boy.

214
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,500
Praise me again?

215
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:32,870
Tell me.

216
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,870
I'll buy you whatever you want.

217
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:37,309
Forget it.

218
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,320
Dad just got back and started checking the herbs.

219
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,480
I feel sorry for him.

220
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,299
How about we go to the night market?

221
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,690
Okay.

222
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,220
Let's go.

223
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,620
Let's go.

224
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,160
Miss.

225
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,760
-Take it.
-Thank you.

226
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,010
Look.

227
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,200
A hit!

228
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,170
Congratulations.

229
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,440
Congratulations on winning the first prize.

230
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,860
Boss.

231
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,650
This is pretty.

232
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,160
So beautiful.

233
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,720
It's really beautiful.

234
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,630
I haven't seen fireworks for a long time.

235
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,190
Me neither.

236
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,110
It's been a long time.

237
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,630
Are you happy?

238
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,430
Yes.

239
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,370
Of course, I'm happy to see the fireworks.

240
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,510
It's so beautiful.

241
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,530
[Side Story]

242
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,940
Do you really

243
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,880
want to just peacefully

244
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,910
be a live-in son-in-law?

245
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,020
You want to forget everything

246
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,030
and just be a live-in son-in-law?

247
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,860
If you really think so,

248
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,240
I'd be quite happy.

249
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,600
After all, the Mo family and I

250
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,000
still have business to do.

251
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,150
I've been exiled to the Western Regions for over ten years.

252
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,190
Every day, every moment,

253
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,240
I haven't forgotten

254
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,070
that Mo Xiang

255
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,190
is an enemy of my Yun family.

256
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,180
But you clearly said

257
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,080
seeing Mo Xiang reminds you of your parents.

258
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,640
But he cared about me.

259
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,030
He even bought me osmanthus cakes.

260
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Can't a high-ranking general

261
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,230
afford osmanthus cakes?

262
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,310
It's different.

263
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,400
You won't understand.
