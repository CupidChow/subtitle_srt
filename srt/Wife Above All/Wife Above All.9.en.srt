[Episode 9]

4
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,100
General Yun!

5
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,240
You can argue with my sister, but you can't...

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,830
Get out! Get out!

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,830
You're even occupying the room of our Qin Family?

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,080
Leave me alone.

9
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,100
I just want to get divorced peacefully,

10
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,630
but she insists on repudiating me.

11
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,030
Divorce?

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,730
With my sister's personality,

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,070
I think she'll issue a repudiation letter.

14
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,110
It's okay.

15
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,390
Let me try.

16
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,610
Yun,

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,610
let me tell you.

18
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,550
You're a matrilocal husband,

19
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,720
and something like arguing

20
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,670
with your wife

21
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,990
often happens.

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,690
Right?

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,520
As a matrilocal husband,

24
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,550
if you run away from home like this,

25
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,140
it's against the moral code for a husband.

26
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,479
Go away!

27
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,720
General Yun.

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,800
You're occupying someone else's room in the middle of the night.

29
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,910
You think that's reasonable, huh?

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,039
If you don't come out,

31
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,009
-I'll…
-Get lost!

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,350
I'll...

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,980
do something else.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,000
I can't afford to offend those who are sad.

35
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,330
Drink it.

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,830
What is this?

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,510
I was going to give it to you after I came back to my room.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,670
Now I'm worried that

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,290
it'll get cold. Drink it while it's still hot.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,430
You just put it...

41
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,440
Don't think that I don't know it.

42
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,550
You didn't even take the medicine previously.

43
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,310
In the early years,

44
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,560
many people already checked

45
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,450
my broken leg.

46
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,510
Drinking herb soup or medicine isn't effective.

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,670
I know

48
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,470
my own condition.

49
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,390
Give it to...

50
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,400
Qin Chonglou.

51
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,100
We had a deal.

52
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,340
I'll treat your disease,

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,290
and you'll give me dividends.

54
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,880
I once saw that

55
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,070
you tried to stand up behind my back.

56
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,920
It means that this medicine was effective.

57
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,680
I thought that

58
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,920
we had a good time today,

59
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,230
so you wouldn't be so resistant.

60
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,360
I've already said this.

61
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,110
Will you drink it or not?

62
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,430
This medicine is very expensive.

63
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,980
I'll give it a try.

64
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,340
Come on.

65
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,240
All the medicine is...

66
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,990
I've finished drinking it.

67
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,020
Over there.

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,900
The warning didn't work.

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,700
Our men

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,410
were even hurt by Yun Zilong.

71
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,670
Maybe our men

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,000
were not able to assassinate him,

73
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,070
but they were very good at escaping.

74
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,420
They didn't leave any clue.

75
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,040
But I think when Yun Zilong

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,460
married into his wife's family,

77
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,100
he was quite unwilling to do it.

78
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,279
How come he's so eager

79
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,019
to protect Mo Jingyu now?

80
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,480
Actually,

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,640
Mo Xiang has more than one daughter.

82
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,670
I've heard that

83
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,580
he also dotes on

84
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,070
his youngest daughter Mo Banxia.

85
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,760
Why don't we

86
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,330
try to influence

87
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,350
the Qin Family?

88
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,070
The Qin Family?

89
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,070
Right.

90
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,830
Prince An.

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,770
His Majesty's second son, Prince An.

92
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,409
I'm going to announce His Majesty's verbal instruction.

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,470
This cripple doesn't need to kneel down.

94
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,150
His Majesty said that

95
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,030
Qin's Medicine Shop failed to examine the medicine carefully,

96
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,750
which almost let to a big disaster.

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,380
Therefore, from today onwards,

98
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Qin's Medicine Shop

99
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,830
doesn't need to provide medicine to the palace anymore.

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,230
General.

101
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,120
Are you really going to give up taking revenge?

102
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,830
How could I forget

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,100
the revenge for the Yun Family?

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,960
Then where are we going now?

105
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,250
Are you going back to the Mo Family?

106
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,310
Have you really been touched by

107
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,620
Mo Xiang's concern for you?

108
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,440
Last night, I heard the conversation

109
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,230
between you and Mr. Qin

110
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,070
in the bathhouse.

111
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,430
You even dared to peep at me while I was taking a bath?

112
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,390
Do I

113
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,510
look like a coward?

114
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,870
I have my own strategies.

115
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,230
You don't understand.

116
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,890
I'm going back to the Mo Family this time

117
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
just in order to find the evidence.

118
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:57,450
As for her,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,260
I won't

120
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,470
get close to her at all.

121
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,030
Let's go.

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,690
Come on, Miss. Look at this.

123
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:15,930
Just buy one.

124
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,610
Miss.

125
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,350
Just buy one.

126
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,150
General.

127
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,350
Are we going back to the Mo Family?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,500
We'll still go back to the Mo Family?

129
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,810
How can I

130
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,780
go back on my word?

131
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,110
Enough!

132
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,590
The imperial edict has been issued.

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,010
Stop talking about it.

134
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,370
No.

135
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,430
We've just

136
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,950
burned a batch of herbs.

137
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,790
If you return another batch,

138
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,080
even though our Qin Family

139
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,340
is rich,

140
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,940
we can't withstand such losses.

141
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,630
I actually

142
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,510
want to help you.

143
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,470
Go ahead.

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,210
However,

145
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,909
it depends on

146
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,420
whether you can return the favor.

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,640
Stop hiding.

148
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,620
Come out.

149
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,550
You...

150
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,280
Don't come over.

151
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,200
Don't come over!

152
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,820
Those are my younger sister's herbs.

153
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,830
Put the herbs down.

154
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,409
I'll explain to the government clearly

155
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,409
and ask them to punish you lightly.

156
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,140
That's her own business.

157
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,200
It has nothing to do with you.

158
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,230
Besides,

159
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,850
you cut off Young Master Chu’s route for gaining money.

160
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,600
Because of that,

161
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,470
I'm also hated by everyone now.

162
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,400
Let me tell you.

163
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,310
At worst,

164
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,980
I'll make you die with me. I...

165
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,050
Let me tell you.

166
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,700
My family's business is my business.

167
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
How dare you try to harm them?

168
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:18,700
Don't think too much.

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,210
I just didn't want to see

170
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,390
a commoner being bullied.

171
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,480
If you had not come,

172
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,550
I could've solved the problem myself.

173
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,230
I'll confess it.

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll tell you everything.

175
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,059
Come on. Hold it for me.

176
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,390
Take him away for me.

177
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't move!

178
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,390
We are Prince An's personal guards.

179
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,510
We passed by this place,

180
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,290
and found that Miss Mo had met a problem,

181
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,610
so we specially came to help her.

182
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,950
Since...

183
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,380
Miss Mo is fine,

184
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,030
we'll leave now.

185
00:08:59,630 --> 00:08:59,950
Let's go!

186
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,020
[Side Story]

187
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,950
Such good herbs are all burnt?

188
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,010
That's right.

189
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,230
I've heard that Mr. Qin's

190
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,240
newlywed wife

191
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,070
ordered to do this personally.

192
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,870
I'm afraid

193
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,740
this Mrs. Qin will destroy the Qin Family.

194
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,030
Mr. Qin has married a bad wife.

195
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,550
Everyone,

196
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,650
all those who are present here today

197
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,160
can get a lucky bag.

198
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,610
Each bag contains some nutritious herbs.

199
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,750
Please often come to Qin's Medicine Shop

200
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,090
to buy herbs in the future.

201
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,290
Come on. This way.

202
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,860
Thank you.

203
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,630
What are you looking for?

204
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,870
Where's Lu Rong?

205
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,990
I've arranged a new job for him.

206
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,120
You've arranged a new job for him?

207
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,210
Lu Rong works for me.

208
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,120
But even you're my man now.
