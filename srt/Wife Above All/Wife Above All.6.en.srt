[Wife Above All]

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,660
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,150
Lou.

5
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,330
Stop pretending to be a wise man.

6
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,950
What bad advice

7
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,020
did you give me?

8
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,150
Brother Yun.

9
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,910
When you lead the army on the battlefield,

10
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,120
you're not in such a hurry.

11
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,350
The provisions should move before the army,

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,440
let alone managing a marriage.

13
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,789
You're so impatient.

14
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,270
That's...

15
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,700
Say something I like to hear.

16
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,160
Stop coughing.

17
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,710
I mean

18
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,750
if you want to wear a crown, you must bear its weight.

19
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,950
If you want to improve

20
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,020
your family status,

21
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,250
you have to offer something.

22
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,590
Offer...

23
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,650
Do you understand how to offer?

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,610
I've been working all morning. I'm so tired.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
As General Zhenyuan,

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,490
I wouldn't do such trivial things.

27
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,170
But I can't bear to see you women

28
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,650
do men's business.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,030
I helped you

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,250
during my vacation.

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,610
Don't thank me.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,200
Men

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,680
should take responsibility.

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,290
You've worked hard.

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,120
It's not easy to work all morning.

36
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,240
It's okay.

37
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,070
After all, you just married into our Mo family.

38
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,670
You're not familiar with many things.

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,710
It's okay. Take your time.

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,200
I'll pay you.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,350
I think

42
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,230
the trick you used to attract her attention

43
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,500
failed.

44
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,460
We have two happy events.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,370
After I went traveling,

46
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,740
both of my daughters were married.

47
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,710
This is great news.

48
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:28,590
I can't wait anymore.

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,980
Take me to the Qin family now

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,030
to visit your sister and your brother-in-law.

51
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,600
By the way, ask your husband to come with us.

52
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,870
Is he good to you?

53
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,420
It's hard to say.

54
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,220
He didn't cause me any trouble.

55
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,190
He's a normal person.

56
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,650
A normal person?

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,440
Your mother

58
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,790
said the same thing about me.

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,800
I'll take it as a compliment.

60
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,670
He's normal...

61
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,190
You must be the normal person,

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,840
my eldest son-in-law, right?

63
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,680
My surname is Yun.

64
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,080
Yun as in Yun Zilong.

65
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,910
I know.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,850
Great.

67
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,870
Let's go

68
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,390
visit your sister-in-law and brother-in-law.

69
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,160
Our family will have

70
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,510
a great reunion today.

71
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,040
Let's go.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,450
Let's go.

73
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,990
I'm not going.

74
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,209
As a live-in husband,

75
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,180
I shouldn't show my face.

76
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,350
Yun Zilong.

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,510
He has a personality. You have a good taste.

78
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,940
Let's go if he doesn't go.

79
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,950
Letâ€™s go.

80
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,250
The herbs are destroyed

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,360
and the money is gone.

82
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,290
It's all about loss.

83
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,640
I really don't understand

84
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,270
why you found a horse gang to transport it,

85
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,930
instead of asking an escort agency to deliver them?

86
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,270
Shunshun Escort Agency

87
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,710
is much more convenient than Yuanyang Horse Gang.

88
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,640
If it doesn't work,

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,159
you can go directly to Jingxi Express.

90
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,540
Isn't the price gap

91
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,720
obvious?

92
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,350
Who would have thought

93
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,750
there would be a storm like this?

94
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,990
We have to advertise in the future.

95
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,900
It will be a big expense.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Qin's Medicine Shop is in such a situation.

97
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,880
You still want to advertise?

98
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,270
Of course.

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,890
Everyone thinks

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,870
Qin's Medicine Shop has fallen.

101
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,840
You can't even cure your leg disease.

102
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,040
If we don't make some ads,

103
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,640
everyone in the capital

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,190
will go to my Mo's Clinic.

105
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,310
You don't like that?

106
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,980
I'm glad to see

107
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,210
Mo's Clinic prosper.

108
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,650
I just don't want my sister to work too hard.

109
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,920
In business,

110
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,560
it's not a good way to suppress your opponents.

111
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,510
It's a good scene

112
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,530
to develop together.

113
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,190
You are

114
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,990
so broad-minded.

115
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,230
Of course.

116
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,110
Which one is the boss of Qin's Medicine Shop?

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,200
Which one?

118
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,260
Who is the boss?

119
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,210
Me.

120
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,430
It's me.

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,620
When our entire caravan passed through here,

122
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,500
we experienced discomfort due to the local environment.

123
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,550
So we took the medicine from your Qin's Medicine Shop.

124
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,320
Later,

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,980
we all vomited water and had diarrhea.

126
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,470
Be elegant.

127
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,290
If you don't compensate us,

128
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,620
we will destroy

129
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,700
your Qin's Medicine Shop

130
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,940
Just speak in your hometown dialect.

131
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,090
You don't have to mimic the capital's dialect.

132
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,020
I can understand you.

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,640
You...

134
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,110
Qin Chonglou.

135
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,180
What's going on?

136
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,160
Stay here. Don't go in.

137
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Take a look.

138
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:25,600
What's going on?

139
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,550
Why are the officials here?

140
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,430
Right.

141
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,300
Mr. Qin.

142
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,950
Someone reported that the medicinal herbs in your pharmacy

143
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,960
are of inferior quality.

144
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,230
Come with us.

145
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,230
Any witness and evidence?

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,740
May I ask who reported it?

147
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,310
Not me.

148
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,250
I didn't report it.

149
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,730
Me.

150
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,540
I reported it to the government.

151
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,760
I know him.

152
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,200
I'm on your side.

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,050
It's him.

154
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,900
Officers.

155
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,680
When I passed by here,

156
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,210
I saw the poor people

157
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,470
took their medicine and suffered.

158
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,610
Out of a sense of justice,

159
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,680
I informed the government.

160
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,030
You must interrogate the two of them.

161
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,980
How dare they

162
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,790
put black soup in the medicine?

163
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Take both of them away.

164
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,710
An outsider bullied my daughter like that.

165
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,490
Can't Qin Chonglou

166
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,430
be brave

167
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,480
and stand up?

168
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,300
Father, calm down.

169
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,620
Let's take a look at the situation first.

170
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,250
Wait.

171
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,750
Something is wrong with the medicine.

172
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,060
My wife and I

173
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,200
should be responsible.

174
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,670
Officer Sun, since you are here,

175
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,960
why don't you figure out

176
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,230
the whole story

177
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,430
before you go back?

178
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,710
[Mo's Mansion]

179
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,690
I heard that the Qin family's business

180
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,060
was taken away from Mr. Qin long ago.

181
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,310
After what happened today,

182
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,020
I'm afraid that Qin's Medicine Shop

183
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,500
will change its name.

184
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,230
That's right.

185
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,860
The late emperor left our family

186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
an iron token,

187
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,090
which can save your life for once.

188
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,130
If you are to be exiled

189
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,070
to the western border,

190
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,800
the most important thing

191
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,680
is to live. Do you understand?

192
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
Do we end up like this because of

193
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,010
Mo Xiang in the capital?

194
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,480
Take my order,

195
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,490
and lead a camp of soldiers

196
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,700
to surround Qin's Medicine Shop.

197
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,410
If an ant leaves,

198
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,050
I'll punish you.

199
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,330
Yes, Sir.

200
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:25,870
Father.

201
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,940
Watch me

202
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,230
to settle

203
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,970
the old debt.

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,520
[Side Story]

205
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,510
These days,

206
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,169
everyone in the capital

207
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,000
knows that

208
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,230
we drew the lucky bag

209
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,200
and married the Mo family.

210
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,549
But how many people know

211
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,720
why we got married?

212
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,710
My father Yun Zhen used to transport the provisions.

213
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,660
Due to the fabrication of medicine,

214
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,150
my whole family was convicted.

215
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,260
The one who supplied

216
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,110
the medicine to your father

217
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,430
was the best pharmacy in the capital,

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,440
the Mo's Clinic.

219
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,630
Except for me,

220
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,750
no one in the Yun family survived.

221
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,130
But the Mo family is safe.

222
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,130
Does that make sense?

223
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,100
I, Yun Zilong,

224
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,820
was exiled to the border

225
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,880
when I was 13.

226
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,550
I made military achievements inch by inch

227
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,340
to return to the capital

228
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
and kill Mo Xiang,

229
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,340
avenging the 31 killed of our family.

230
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,840
I heard that Mo Xiang favors his illegitimate daughter.

231
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,090
I thought by marrying her

232
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,920
I could find evidence of the Mo family's plot

233
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,140
against the Yun family.

234
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:33,850
I heard that

235
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,890
the legitimate daughter of the Mo family is highly skilled in medicine.

236
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,040
I thought only she

237
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,150
could cure my leg disease.

238
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,580
I didn't expect Mo Banxia

239
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,270
to also learn a lot of skills.

240
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,350
She even put so much effort

241
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,450
into curing me.

242
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,160
Brother Yun.

243
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,280
Can you promise me one thing?

244
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,730
Given that

245
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,090
we grew up together,

246
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,480
can you not deal with

247
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,310
Mo Xiang so early?

248
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,810
Otherwise,

249
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,080
no one will treat my leg.

250
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,330
When I was exiled,

251
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,300
you wrote to me.

252
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,330
That's why I knew the situation in the capital.

253
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,330
But there were too many spies in the court.

254
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,260
Also, there were so many people

255
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,760
coveting your family's business.

256
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,690
Fortunately, the situation is better now.

257
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,710
We can make long-term plans.

258
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,150
Fine.

259
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,350
I promise you.

260
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,950
Actually,

261
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,020
I think Mo Xiang

262
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,380
is not like what I imagined.
