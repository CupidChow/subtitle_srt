[Episode 27]

4
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,630
Evidence?

5
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,630
As long as I want,

6
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,870
I'll have evidence.

7
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,800
I didn't say anything

8
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,270
for the sake

9
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,750
of Prince An's dignity.

10
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,670
If you keep being unreasonable,

11
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,230
don't blame me

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,220
for disregarding our father-son relationship.

13
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,390
But he is also your son.

14
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,570
The crown prince is weak.

15
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,150
Who knows...

16
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,670
Noble Consort Liu.

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,690
Since you mentioned the crown prince,

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,039
now I know

19
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,550
what you two are up to.

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,550
A few days ago,

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,000
that bastard

22
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,680
delivered the ore here.

23
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,870
What's his purpose?

24
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,030
This...

25
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,430
This...

26
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,920
The ore

27
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,480
comes from Yuntai Shuixie.

28
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,690
It's the most suitable for a hot spring bath.

29
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,630
That?

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,520
Forget it.

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,190
You two are so impatient.

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,840
You should let me finish.

33
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,570
This kind of hot spring bath is nothing special

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,390
for ordinary people.

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,110
But it's different for pregnant women.

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,120
It looks fine

37
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,300
when pregnant women take this kind of hot spring bath.

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,390
But with the medicine to secure a pregnancy,

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,070
there will be a risk of miscarriage.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
What's coincidental is

41
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,440
the crown princess is pregnant.

42
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,190
Prince An decided to deliver the ore

43
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,190
at this time.

44
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,680
He has ulterior motives.

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,550
His Majesty can tolerate anything else.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
-But murder...
-Enough.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,030
Don't ask too much

48
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,050
about things in the palace.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,190
We've finally returned to the capital.

50
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,190
Have you figured out your own business?

51
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:02,960
It's okay.

52
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,980
I can help you.

53
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,240
You just came back.

54
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,470
You must need help

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,570
in the clinic and Medicated Diet Restaurant.

56
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,940
You can stay.

57
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,230
I'll pay you

58
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,610
according to the lowest hourly pay

59
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,890
in the capital.

60
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,710
That's not what I mean.

61
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,820
That's what I mean.

62
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,550
Qin,

63
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,329
what kind of painting is this?

64
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,030
The dragon and phoenix.

65
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,660
Can't you tell?

66
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,010
Do you have to use

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,250
my ink brush made of the best weasel's hair?

68
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,530
You can write?

69
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,650
Yun.

70
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,910
Now,

71
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,510
how does Ms. Mo treat you?

72
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,750
Don't mention it.

73
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,080
You should focus on your career.

74
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,270
I heard

75
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,190
County Chief An

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,140
doesn't have the intention to go to the fief.

77
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,010
Where is he now?

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,840
I heard he's in a palace

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,350
in the suburbs.

80
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,070
A palace in the suburbs?

81
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,270
Over there, only the north of the city

82
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,960
doesn't set up defenses.

83
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,590
There's a secret canal there.

84
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,630
As long as he bribes someone,

85
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,080
he can sneak

86
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,150
back to the capital.

87
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,990
But now Prince An's Mansion is being investigated.

88
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,290
If he comes back,

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,260
where would he go?

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,300
His Majesty's oral edict is here.

91
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,060
It's urgent. So keep things simple.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,700
His Majesty ordered you to go

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,710
to County Chief An's palace immediately.

94
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,440
Is there something

95
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,870
bothering you?

96
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,030
I know.

97
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,600
Young Master is on duty

98
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,590
and hasn't come back,

99
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,740
so you are worried, right?

100
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,710
Does Mo's Clinic have a young master?

101
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,840
How come I don't know that?

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,590
I understand.

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,390
I just think

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,040
General is suitable for our clinic.

105
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,550
Bad news!

106
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,790
Something happened.

107
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,510
What happened?

108
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,840
Someone from the side residence

109
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,350
said...

110
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,659
said General has an affair with a maid.

111
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,390
He has...

112
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,409
has been imprisoned.

113
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,360
Miss.

114
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,560
It's meaningless

115
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,510
for her to keep kneeling here.

116
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,190
Why don't you persuade her?

117
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,900
It's useless to persuade her.

118
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,590
There is something she wants to do

119
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,550
and someone she's willing to trust.

120
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,960
Why should I stop her?

121
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,270
We should just stay here

122
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,370
and accompany her.

123
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,000
That means

124
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,470
she has feelings

125
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,080
for General Yun.

126
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,070
She's willing to trust General Yun

127
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,100
and risk her life for him.

128
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm just...

129
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,360
curious.

130
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,870
If I were in trouble today,

131
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,470
would you do the same?

132
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,909
Do you want me to kneel on the street?

133
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,830
-That's not what I mean.
-We're talking about my sister.

134
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,180
What does it have to do with you?

135
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,110
His Majesty said

136
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,760
Yun Zilong, the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

137
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,610
met a maid in secret.

138
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,670
The evidence is solid.

139
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,790
He has been put into the prison.

140
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,830
He will be executed someday.

141
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,750
Don't kneel here.

142
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,010
Are you doing this deliberately to let others know

143
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,130
His Majesty is here?

144
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,790
Sister.

145
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,240
Zhifan?

146
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,670
I won't go

147
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,180
to that remote and barren place.

148
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,680
The throne will be mine

149
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,670
sooner or later.

County Chief An,

153
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,170
you're finally here.

154
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,950
I was running out of patience waiting.

155
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,260
The throne

156
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,840
is not something you can have.

157
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,470
Yun Zilong,

158
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,820
let's make a deal.

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
County Chief An,

160
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,260
if you want to sit on the throne,

161
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,880
ask me, the Commander of the Imperial Guards,

162
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,870
if I agree first.

163
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:22,990
Yun Zilong,

164
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,680
do you think

165
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,520
it's helpful to guard here?

166
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,290
Since I have the guts to come back,

167
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,230
I won't be unprepared.

168
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,820
The imperial palace has been surrounded by my men.

169
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,840
Even if you go there now,

170
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,990
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,789
[Side Story]

172
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,490
Listen to me.

173
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,090
In this village,

174
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,000
half of you

175
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,030
have caught a cold.

176
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,400
It's due to the fungi

177
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,590
on the clothes.

178
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:51,990
So,

179
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
what we need to do now

180
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,720
is to burn the old clothes

181
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,670
and bedding.

182
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,910
Don't worry.
