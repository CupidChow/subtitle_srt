[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,680
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,870
It seems that you're

5
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,720
determined to

6
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,539
stay away from me.

7
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,789
I advise you

8
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,030
not to be silly.

9
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,880
You mean calabashes?

10
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,630
Calabashes are good herbs.

11
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,620
I always travel around,

12
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,190
and I will find a good place to plant them.

13
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:42,850
In the future,

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,380
I'll offer some of them to you.

15
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,870
A toast to you.

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,530
I know that

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,920
you like travelling around.

18
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,020
I wanted to give a beautiful woman to you,

19
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,380
but it's a pity that you didn't accept my kindness.

20
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,640
It doesn't matter.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,860
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

22
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,680
Then you don't need to be afraid

23
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,050
of your deceased wife,

24
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,310
and it won't affect your plan of travelling around.

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,850
Wait!

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,910
Yun.

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to deliver the food that has been ordered.

28
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm going to be late.

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,390
You should taste it even though you're going to be late.

30
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,940
There's no need to taste this, right?

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,640
Why can't you eat it?

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,670
Come on. Taste it.

33
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,390
Is it edible?

34
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,400
Why do you think it's not edible?

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,070
No, this is...

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,360
You can just let them eat this later.

37
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,400
I don't need to eat it.

38
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,190
You have to eat it.

39
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,760
I won't eat it.

40
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,260
Sister!

41
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,350
Dou!

42
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,520
Here's the herbal cuisine made by us.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,079
Don't get too addicted to it.

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,190
Have you seen my father?

45
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,250
No.

46
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,230
No.

47
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,810
There was an order at noon,

48
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,110
and my father was designated to deliver the food.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,660
But at this hour,

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,490
my father hasn't come back yet.

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,560
Maybe your father has gone to

52
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,510
slack off and play cards.

53
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,270
I often...

54
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,260
Where did the order come from?

55
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
Tianhe Restaurant.

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,390
Where should the food be sent to?

57
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,500
Tianhe Restaurant.

58
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,650
The food ordered by Tianhe Restaurant

59
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,840
was going to be sent to Tianhe Restaurant?

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,180
The backyard of Tianhe Restaurant

61
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,420
seems to be connected to Prince An's Residence.

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,590
Did your father...

63
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,550
Father!

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,670
Let's go take a look.

65
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,070
I'm not good at accounting.

66
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm always unable to manage the assets in my mansion.

67
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,390
I've heard that your second daughter

68
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,110
is very good at accounting.

69
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,740
Could you please ask her to

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,250
do the accounting clearly

71
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,950
for these two account books?

72
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,950
I feel itchy.

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,290
Dr. Mo!

74
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,850
Are you going to reject me again?

75
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,550
No.

76
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,230
Well...

77
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,670
I'm allergic. I feel itchy.

78
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,230
How come I'm allergic?

79
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,380
How come I'm allergic today?

80
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,500
I pretended to be allergic to

81
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,450
that cup of tea.

82
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,280
Then I lay on the ground,

83
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,510
and said that I felt itchy all over my body.

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,480
I started to tear off my clothes.

85
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,960
You know what?

86
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,520
I tore all my clothes off.

87
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,720
In this way, they wouldn't be able to hide

88
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,830
the account books on me.

89
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,440
Then,

90
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,160
I left Prince An's Mansion just like that.

91
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,000
Am I smart?

92
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,840
Yes, you are.

93
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,510
Father, hurry up.

94
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,110
Cover your body with the blanket.

95
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,399
Prince An

96
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,910
wanted my father to change the account books of his mansion.

97
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,680
There's no doubt that

98
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,000
it'll be dangerous to do the accounting for him.

99
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,670
Father,

100
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,950
although you came out safely this time,

101
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,230
what will you do next?

102
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,750
What should we do?

103
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,159
You two look comfortable sitting there.

104
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,190
Think of a way.

105
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,700
Do we

106
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,360
have the rights to make decisions in the Mo Family?

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,700
I have an idea.

108
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,880
You just let Mo Xiang

109
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,030
go like that.

110
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,830
Our previous efforts

111
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,150
will be in vain, won't they?

112
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,620
I know that.

113
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,010
However, though Mo Xiang practices medicine among the common people,

114
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,910
he once saved my father's life.

115
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,110
Because of that,

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,040
I can't hurt him so easily.

117
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,310
Well,

118
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,390
we'll just let him be like that?

119
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,470
What else can we do?

120
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,960
I gave him a stepping stone but he refused.

121
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,380
What else can I do?

122
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,710
Uncle,

123
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,490
how about you think of a way for me?

124
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,510
Father.

125
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,800
Do we have to shut down

126
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,100
our clinic just like that?

127
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,409
Prince An has ulterior motives.

128
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,070
I can't make

129
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,040
all my family members

130
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,909
get involved in this trouble.

131
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,760
If we have to leave, we should leave now.

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,870
We can't delay.

133
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,320
I've already informed your sister

134
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,800
to start packing up her things.

135
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,690
Say it to me again.

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,580
I'll just say it again.

137
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,460
I won't take this medicine anymore.

138
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,720
Do you have a conscience or not?

139
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,390
Do you know how hard it was for me

140
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,030
to decoct this medicine?

141
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,990
This is a chance for you to give it up.

142
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,110
Then you don't need to bother with it.

143
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,880
I've told you that

144
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,640
there is no need to treat my leg disease.

145
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,120
I said yes to you because I wanted you

146
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,190
to run Qin's Medicine Shop well.

147
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,790
Now that Qin's Medicine Shop has been shut down,

148
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,180
is it still necessary for me to drink this medicine?

149
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,430
Qin Chonglou.

150
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,930
What do you think your health is?

151
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,240
Do you think it's a bargaining chip which makes me earn money for you?

152
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,990
Fine.

153
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,750
You said it.

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,720
You said that

155
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,630
you wouldn't take this medicine anymore.

156
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,120
If you can't push your wheelchair in the future,

157
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,590
don't regret it

158
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,570
or blame me. Let me tell you.

159
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you want to stay in the imperial court

160
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,930
and continue to work as an official

161
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,930
or go back to our hometown with us?

162
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,030
I...

163
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,580
His Majesty appointed me to this official position personally.

164
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,780
The holidays are over.

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,310
I have to stay.

166
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,200
How can the family members separate from

167
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,470
each other so easily?

168
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,450
Just go back to the General's Mansion.

169
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,730
Just be my wife.

170
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,390
As you know,

171
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,550
my aspirations

172
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,150
are always related to Mo's Clinic.

173
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,200
I've made up my mind.

174
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,390
I'll go back to my hometown with my father

175
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,300
and continue to run the clinic.

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,990
Are you really angry?

177
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,800
Can you take me with you

178
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,230
when you go back to your hometown?

179
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,630
Now that Qin's Medicine Shop has been shut down,

180
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,770
where do you think I can go?

181
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,930
Considering that you're the shareholder,

182
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,070
I'll say yes reluctantly.

183
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,630
Will you drink the medicine or not?

184
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,570
Forget it.

185
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,830
My father has said that

186
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,500
only when you want to receive treatment

187
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,880
will there be hope for your disease.

188
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,430
My father personally checked your pulse.

189
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
I decocted medicine for you every day.

190
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:32,909
I...

191
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,470
What's my purpose?

192
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,710
Get it done for me.

193
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,630
Yun Zhen was the General of Dingzhou, and his son

194
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,890
plotted to get married with my daughter this time

195
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,000
just in order to

196
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,590
kill me.

197
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,350
Right?

198
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,620
You know my background?

199
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,640
What happened to the Yun Family

200
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,240
shocked the whole imperial court back then.

201
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,600
How could I not know it?

202
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,510
I've seen countless people in my life.

203
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,520
When I first saw you that day,

204
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,480
I could sense that

205
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,830
there was hatred in your eyes.

206
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,720
Your hatred

207
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,000
was against me.

208
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,820
If you want to kill me,

209
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,510
you can do it now.

210
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,120
When I go back to my hometown,

211
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,350
you'll have no chance.

212
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,430
Why didn't you expose my scheme?

213
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,310
You even treat me as your family.

214
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,280
That's not strange.

215
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,510
Though you hate me,

216
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,560
I don't hate you at all.

217
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,710
That's why I can treat you with a normal attitude.

218
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,270
You mean that your daily observation on me

219
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,580
is a normal attitude?

220
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,040
You are my son-in-law.

221
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,230
Isn't it right for me to treat you like that?

222
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,560
Back then,

223
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,880
because you

224
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,600
gave the fake medicine to the Yun Family,

225
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,550
all the 31 members of the Yun Family

226
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,470
were killed.

227
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,890
I just want to know

228
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,990
if I really had something to do with the massacre of the Yun Family,

229
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,260
how will you treat my eldest daughter?

230
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,080
I just want to hear your answer.

231
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,030
As for what happened ten years ago,

232
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,910
no matter what the truth is,

233
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,970
are you willing to protect her?

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,530
That's something between you and me.

235
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,290
It has nothing to do with her.

236
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,190
I'm her husband.

237
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,140
I will surely protect her.

238
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,470
Good.

239
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,510
Remember what you said.

240
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,640
[Side Story]

241
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,860
My leg disease

242
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,190
seems to be caused by my weak health.

243
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,430
Actually,

244
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,310
it was caused by the residual poison.

245
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,350
Did your stupid cousin poison you?

246
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
It had something to do with him.

247
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,430
I'm afraid this poison

248
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,950
wasn't acquired so easily.

249
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,350
Was it given by Prince An?

250
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,870
Who else could be the culprit

251
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,030
except for him?

252
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,590
You've long known that

253
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,710
the person who harmed your family

254
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,390
was Prince An's man, right?

255
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,470
Yun.

256
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm different from you.

257
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,790
I don't have the ability to take revenge.

258
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,630
However,

259
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,230
my parents and brothers

260
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,030
must want me to

261
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,310
live my life seriously.

262
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,750
As for this principle,

263
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,950
only after I came to the Mo Family

264
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,720
did I understand it.

265
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,510
In the past,

266
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,710
I just thought that

267
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,310
this was my fate.

268
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,870
Therefore, I ignored the prescription

269
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,830
they gave me.

270
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,190
I've been sitting on a wheelchair for ten years.

271
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,390
Yun.

272
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,830
Mo Xiang has said that

273
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,110
as long as I'm cooperative,

274
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,430
within a month,

275
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,230
I'll be able to stand up.

276
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,470
Do you understand what I mean?

277
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,390
It's not hard to treat my leg disease.

278
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,630
When it's cured,

279
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,590
it means you've fulfilled

280
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,030
your promise to me.

281
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,070
But how are you going to

282
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,110
face Mo Xiang?

283
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,430
Will you go to his hometown

284
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,630
and kill him?

285
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,750
Can you stop talking about it?

286
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,470
I feel distressed now.
