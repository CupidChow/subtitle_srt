[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,730
[Episode 1]

4
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,830
By the grace of heaven, the Emperor’s decree is as follows.

5
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,130
I went to the bathhouse a few days ago

6
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,770
and met General Yun Zilong

7
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,960
and Mr. Qin Chonglou, manager of Qin's Medicine Shop.

8
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,700
They pled to get married to the two daughters of the Mo family.

9
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,320
[Yun Zilong, General Zhenyuan]

10
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,750
You two have worked hard

11
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,570
and brought me a lot of happiness.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,880
Let's not stick to traditional customs for your marriage.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,590
I'll give you two lucky bags.

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
Each of you draw one to see the result.

15
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,440
Please forgive me for not being able to make a gesture

16
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,390
due to wearing a suit of armor.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,420
Forget it.

18
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,470
Mr. Wen.

19
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,430
His Majesty allowed me

20
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,180
to marry the illegitimate daughter of the Mo family.

21
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,310
But now,

22
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,350
he asked us to draw the lucky bags.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,930
Everything is uncertain.

24
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,000
If I marry into the Mo family

25
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,940
as a general,

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,980
wouldn't I be a laughing stock?

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,990
Just bear with it.

28
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,580
[Qin Chonglou, manager of Qin's Medicine Shop]

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Greetings, Mr. Wen.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,190
I have a leg disease.

31
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,710
So forgive me for not making a gesture.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,750
I can see that.

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,950
You can't vent your anger on me

34
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,590
just because you're worried about drawing the lucky bags.

35
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,829
It's all your fault.

36
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,270
You love to please His Majesty.

37
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,350
Now you've induced trouble.

38
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,310
The Mo family is now managed

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,910
by Mo Jingyu, the legitimate daughter.

40
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,510
If I get her,

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,400
as a general, am I going to be

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,180
a live-in husband?

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm the same.

44
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,620
My parents and eldest brother died in vain.

45
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,390
The Qin's Medicine Shop was taken by others.

46
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,990
If I marry

47
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,110
the illegitimate daughter, Mo Banxia,

48
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,970
we'll have a hard time together.

49
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,310
I went to the Live-in Son-in-law Academy

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,110
for so many years.

51
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,230
It'll be all for nothing.

52
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,090
Who said that?

53
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,790
As a student at Live-in Son-in-law Academy,

54
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,990
you are guaranteed to get a job.

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,630
Don't worry.

56
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,190
Leave this to me.

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,990
The Mo family's illegitimate daughter,

58
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,350
Mo Banxia, is here!

59
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,030
Sirs.

60
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,960
After drawing the lucky bag,

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,190
the live-in husband should go into the empty sedan chair.

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,400
The one who marries the bride

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,600
can carry the sedan chair of the illegitimate daughter of the Mo family

64
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,510
back.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,730
He has broad shoulders and a wide back.

66
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,510
If he doesn't get cupping therapy, it would be a pity.

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,520
A live-in husband?

68
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,810
Getting in the sedan chair?

69
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,510
I won't be a live-in son-in-law.

70
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,840
The Imperial Sword.

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,630
General Yun.

72
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,990
Mind your words and actions.

73
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,990
You said there would be a deal.

74
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,550
Is it reliable?

75
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,240
When picking the lucky bag,

76
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
let me pick it first.

77
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,320
Then you'll get what you want.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
What?

79
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,190
How come a medicine shopowner is so weak?

80
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,159
Master Mo has gone on a journey.

81
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,950
His Majesty has specifically instructed me

82
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,430
to test you two on behalf of Master Mo.

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
You need to melt the ice before you get the lucky bags.

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
We not only have to draw lucky bags to decide who to marry,

85
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,380
but we also have to obtain these lucky bags in this way.

86
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,560
I‘m Yun Zilong, General Zhenyuan.

87
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,800
I would rather die than draw it.

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,320
I wouldn't even marry...

89
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,310
The Imperial Sword.

90
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,010
You've wasted time.

91
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,800
Talking about drawing the lucky bag.

92
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,150
Qin Chonglou.

93
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,790
You'd better be reliable.

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,430
If I am the live-in husband,

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll send you to the army to burn firewood.

96
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,909
Pick one.

97
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,620
Thank you.

98
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,790
Hurry up.

99
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,170
Pick one.

100
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,350
Why is there blood on both of them?

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,540
I just bled a little.

102
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:06,800
Just a minor injury.

103
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,910
Bro.

104
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,120
I bribed someone using bloodstains

105
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,870
as a mark.

106
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,120
How would I pick now?

107
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,400
Yun Zilong, General Zhenyuan,

108
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,140
will be the live-in husband of Mo Jingyu, the legitimate daughter of the Mo family.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,150
Qin Chonglou of Qin's Medicine Shop

110
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,060
will marry Mo Banxia, the illegitimate daughter of the Mo family.

111
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,970
I'd rather die than be a live-in son-in-law.

112
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,190
Your Highness.

113
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:54,940
It's done.

114
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,790
The marriage between Qin Chonglou

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,870
and the eldest daughter of the Mo family

116
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,830
was ruined.

117
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,950
With my mother helping me,

118
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm quite relieved.

119
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,670
But Your Highness,

120
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,320
in this way,

121
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,150
the one who married the eldest daughter of the Mo family

122
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,180
became General Yun.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,910
If the Mo family and the General's Mansion work together,

124
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,870
I'm afraid...

125
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,390
Yun Zilong

126
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,840
was a sinner.

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,970
He gained the title as General Zhenyuan

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
by military merits.

129
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,310
Now,

130
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,220
the rebellion in the northwest has been settled.

131
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,910
Yun Zilong can't be a threat.

132
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,770
He's nothing to be afraid of.

133
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,830
Your Highness, you're wise.

134
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,670
[Side Story]

135
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,070
Sir...

136
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,190
Qin Chonglou.

137
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,990
As an excellent graduate,

138
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,860
why did you disobey the virtue of men and go out

139
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,630
without permission?

140
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,050
Even if Miss Mo Jingyu doesn't care,

141
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,550
how can you not keep the virtues of men in mind?

142
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,300
Sir, stop talking nonsense.

143
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,730
I...

144
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,240
I'm not the live-in son-in-law.

145
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,810
There was a mark on the lucky bag.

146
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,250
How could it be wrong?

147
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,480
You must be joking.

148
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,470
General Yun?

149
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,200
I heard that this bathhouse

150
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,990
can make people feel refreshed.

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,880
Why do I feel

152
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,030
so irritated?

153
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,980
No, no.

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,240
Please don't.

155
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,040
Sir.

156
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,370
Is the Live-in Son-in-law Academy

157
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,620
still accepting students?
