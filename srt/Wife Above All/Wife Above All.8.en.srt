[Episode 8]

4
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:12,510
Idiot.

5
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,870
Back then,

6
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,830
I finally got rid of

7
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:15,930
the old shopkeeper of the Qin family.

8
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,930
I thought Chu Dezhao

9
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,390
could handle Qin's Medicine Shop

10
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,850
and serve the army in my mansion.

11
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,230
But who knew

12
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,789
he would turn out to be like this?

13
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,840
We just arranged for some people

14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,770
to cause trouble at the clinic,

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,120
and they actually turned the tables

16
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,310
and staged a scene at their own doorstep.

17
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,840
What's more surprising

18
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,360
is that General Yun dared to mobilize troops

19
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,570
to support the Mo family.

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,470
This Mo family

21
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,750
seems to have some kind of charm.

22
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,430
They even managed harmony

23
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,670
after marrying the wrong people.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,830
Don't mention harmony to me.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,470
I thought with the exchange of brides,

26
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,789
their families

27
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,030
would have a major falling out.

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,270
But now, it seems

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,500
I underestimated the Mo family.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,070
Mo Xiang

31
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,450
practices medicine with the common people

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,060
and has gained my father's trust.

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,930
Then...

34
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,620
I'll kill him.

35
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,430
Go and kill him now.

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:12,840
Okay.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,560
Alright, and then handle that

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,790
barely alive Qin's Medicine Shop

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,570
for my use.

40
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,270
Yes.

41
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,200
Okay?

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,910
Okay.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,600
Well.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,050
No.

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,980
That old man

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,600
has some integrity. He's upright

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,010
and never made things difficult for me...

48
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,720
How did I end up with

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,210
a bunch of stupid trash like you?

50
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,200
If I weren't

51
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,710
in need of people right now,

52
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,010
I'd have killed you long ago.

53
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,280
Your Highness!

54
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,230
This can't be!

55
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,340
You can't do that!

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,060
I...

57
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,230
Am quite useful.

58
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,950
What's the use of you?

59
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,310
I have another plan.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,690
At this moment,

61
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,829
we need to give the Mo family a warning,

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,550
and show them

63
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,100
the consequences of opposing you, Your Highness.

64
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,160
Yun Zilong

65
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,380
is staunchly supporting the Mo family, right?

66
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,840
Then let's hit him

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,950
where it hurts.

68
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,810
Osmanthus cake. I just bought it.

69
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,850
I treated your father like that.

70
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,490
Aren't you angry?

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,450
What do you think?

72
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,300
My father saw you were upset

73
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,970
and asked me to come and check on you.

74
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,170
I didn't want to come.

75
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,860
Your father has been considerate.

76
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,460
I don't want him to care about me.

77
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,670
What?

78
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,060
Are you unwilling?

79
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,980
I...

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,560
Who?

81
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,150
Execute the plan.

82
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,860
Stay alert.

83
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,710
Are you okay?

84
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,430
How is the search going?

85
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,050
No luck.

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,850
The lead went cold at the night market.

87
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,290
There were so many of them here,

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,240
but only three acted.

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,970
They probably didn't mean to kill.

90
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,680
General,

91
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,230
do you really think

92
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,830
these assassins were coming for you?

93
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,710
What else?

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,670
They just wanted to warn me.

95
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,260
So, what's your plan?

96
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,520
I plan to

97
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,070
divorce her.

98
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,590
You want to divorce me?

99
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,630
Yes.

100
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,120
It's better for everyone's

101
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,090
reputation.

102
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,830
Fine.

103
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,170
Since you saved me,

104
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,110
I agree

105
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,390
to repudiate you.

106
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,310
It's a divorce.

107
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,210
You saw it today.

108
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,350
Those killers came for me.

109
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,310
As the general

110
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,230
favored by His Majesty,

111
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,480
I naturally attract envy.

112
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,280
Divorce is the best solution.

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,470
This way, you won't be implicated because of me.

114
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,290
No need to thank me.

115
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,730
As a man,

116
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,030
I should bear it.

117
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,360
If you think

118
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,390
the clinic needs me,

119
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,710
after the divorce,

120
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,790
if there's any need for me

121
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,800
in the clinic,

122
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,870
you can find me at the military barracks.

00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,070
Since you're leaving,

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,909
you don't have to

126
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,810
keep things from me.

127
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,220
What am I hiding from you?

128
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,600
You got injured in the fight

129
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,150
just now,

130
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,550
why hide it from me?

131
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,540
I won't change my mind.

132
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,690
I'm a doctor.

133
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
I can't stand seeing people hurt.

134
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,470
Let me write

135
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,430
the repudiation letter.

136
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,050
Later when I have time,

137
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,150
I'll report it to the authorities.

138
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,100
It's not a repudiation letter. It's a di...

139
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,640
Now,

140
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,200
I still have the final say, right?

141
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,770
I'm doing this for your own good.

142
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,790
Yun Zilong,

If you want to leave,

146
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,960
I won't make things difficult for you.

147
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,140
But there's one thing.

148
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,140
Whether we're together or not,

149
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,960
we can't bring any trouble

150
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,030
to the clinic.

151
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,470
So

152
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
now isn't a good time for me

153
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,910

This medicine is quite difficult to prepare.

This is nothing.

Don't take it to heart.

How about

skipping sleep tonight

When dealing with women,

you have to win their hearts.

if he's pretending?

196
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,470
I approached Mo Xiang

197
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,620
to find evidence.

198
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,980
Mo Xiang has been back for days.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,590
I haven't seen you

200
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,450
talk to him.

201
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,170
There hasn't been a suitable time.

202
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I'll wait until after the divorce.

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,710
Look at you.

204
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
You went to great lengths

205
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,240
to marry the Mo family,

206
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,670
and now you're thinking about divorcing.

207
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,670
Don't you think it's troublesome?

208
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,770
What if she

209
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,910
refuses to divorce you forever?

210
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,140
Won't you seek revenge?

211
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,140
He's been cursing you

212
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,120
left and right,

213
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,070
and yet, you're still speaking up for him.

214
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,050
Can it be the same?

215
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,250
Mo Xiang has been

216
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,030
putting effort into our Qin's Medicine Shop.

217
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,930
So what if he curses me a bit?

218
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm shameless.

219
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,910
Are you crazy?

220
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,240
Are you insane?

221
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,470
Bootlicker.
