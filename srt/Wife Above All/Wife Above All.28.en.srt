4
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,430
Be careful.

5
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,789
Slowly.

6
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,510
I'm exhausted.

7
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,550
I haven't run like this for a long time.

8
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,230
What does Sister want to do?

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,190
Don't ask.

10
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,810
We just need to listen to her.

11
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,270
Are your legs okay?

12
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,870
Yes.

13
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,070
It's almost time.

14
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,550
Your Highness.

15
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,270
Your Highness.

16
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,590
I'm afraid we can't hold on any longer.

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,030
What?

18
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,509
We don't have

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,100
enough firearms.

20
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,080
How is that possible?

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,080
I've planned this for years.

22
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,390
How could I not know

23
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,730
how many firearms there are.

24
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,640
County Chief An,

25
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,880
you lost.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,350
Is there anything else you want to say?

27
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,820
Impossible.

28
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,050
Impossible.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,150
I checked them a few days ago.

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,630
It's impossible for you to know

31
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,770
where the firearms are.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,590
I'm not the only one

33
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,450
who wants to take revenge on you.

34
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,570
You think you're smart.

35
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,490
And you are ambitious.

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,920
But you don't know what goes around

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,940
comes around.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,329
When you used all kinds of means

39
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,430
to kill

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,510
those who were against you,

41
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,329
you should've known there would be consequences.

even if I die,

45
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,270
I'll kill you.

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,870

already failed.

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,210
If your men still listen to you,

51
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,390
they would be

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,130
risking their own lives, right?

53
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,540
By the way, I have good news for you.

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,710
The men you sent to the imperial palace

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,430
have surrendered.

56
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,770
Impossible.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,950
Impossible.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,550
A few days ago,

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,150
I saw it clearly.

60
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,840
It's impossible for you

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,230
to know where the firearms are.

62
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,110
This is His Majesty's order.

After arresting Prince An,

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,940
put him in prison immediately.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,710

68
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,990
there are firearms there?

69
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,890
Thanks to Yun Zilong, that jerk.

70

This is the item

71

left by Yun Zilong in the imperial palace.

72

His Majesty said

73
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,920
it will contaminate the environment if we throw it away

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,790
and it will smell if we burn it.

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,140
He asked you to take it back

76
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,290
as a keepsake.

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,300
Yun Zilong went to see His Majesty.

78
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,080
Why did he bring a bag of herbs?

79
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,040
Could it be that His Majesty and he

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,019
are discussing something in private?

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,130
Yun Zilong must be fine.

88
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,720
you are not interested in these.

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,610

My bad.

93

Did you want to scare me to death?

Well, I...

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,330
we had a deal.

We have nothing to do with each other.

You're so different.

why you married me?

134

because I trust you.

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,430
I know what kind of person you are.

140
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,710

with whether we get married or not.

142

Jumping into a fire pit just once

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
is already enough.

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,830
I also want to know.

he is more handsome than you?

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,750
Do you think you are handsome?

162
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,020

Yes, you're doomed.

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,230
it was all your plan.

If it were me,

175
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,010
Mo Banxia would kill me with a knife

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,160
in the kitchen.

177
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,100
You are lucky.

178
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,660

No need.
