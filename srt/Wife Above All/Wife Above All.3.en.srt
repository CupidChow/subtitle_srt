[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,700
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,160
I'm so scared.

5
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,020
Qin.

6
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,870
Seeing you like this,

7
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,200
it's not convenient for you to visit customers

8
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,030
with me.

9
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,210
Besides,

10
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,570
in order to be a live-in son-in-law of the Mo family,

11
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,310
you have schemed deliberately.

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,030
I'm afraid

13
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,430
the prosperity of Qin's Medicine Shop

14
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,910
is just an illusion.

15
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,370
Where did the savings

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,520
of a second-hand dealer like you go?

17
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
Judging from your reaction,

18
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,920
don't tell me that even Qin's Medicine Shop

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,430
is not entirely under your control.

20
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,990
Qin's Medicine Shop

21
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,270
is now managed

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,930
by my cousin, Chu Dezhao.

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,990
So...

24
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,110
Where are we going?

25
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,710
This...

26
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,320
It's not the way back to Qin's Medicine Shop, is it?

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,080
The Qin family is an empty shell.

28
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,150
Why do we return?

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,720
I think

30
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,710
we should take this opportunity

31
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,140
to do business with my sister.

32
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,310
Qin's Medicine Shop can invest in Mo's Clinic.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,250
We won't pay you interests for three years.

34
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,390
When it's expired,

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,750
we'll give dividends to you according to the ratio.

36
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,910
Aren't you going to talk about the details?

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,590
Are you qualified to talk about details?

38
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,509
For the rest of your life,

39
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,030
you'd better

40
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,190
follow the Mo family.

41
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,710
For the rest of my life?

42
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,070
Qin.

43
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,880
The red bottle is for internal use, and the white bottle is for external applications.

44
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,110
I'm a doctor, so I kindly remind you.

45
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,860
This medicine is expensive.

46
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,090
Your injury is a minor one.

47
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,070
Just once is enough.

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,390
What?

49
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,810
You can't even draw a proper lucky bag.

50
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,110
Neither of you

51
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,940
deserves my sister.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,250
Useless people.

53
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,870
Who is useless?

54
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,340
Me.

55
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,500
Help me.

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,590
What are you looking at? Help him.

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,750
Am I able to carry him up?

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,110
Why are you here?

59
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,590
Has His Majesty changed his mind?

60
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,160
I can make some sacrifice

61
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,350
and take you fool in.

62
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,670
I don't want you to bother my sister.

63
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,760
Who're you calling a fool?

64
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,290
You.

65
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:06,960
I...

66
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,420
I'm a fool.

67
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,790
Where is my sister?

68
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,710
I don't know.

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,120
I think she's working in the clinic.

70
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,130
Are you two done?

71
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,840
Can I tell you

72
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,870
something important?

73
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,050
Let me tell you...

74
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,950
-Young Master.
-Let’s…

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,510
Young Master.

76
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,960
I seem to have seen you somewhere.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,610
Young Mistress.

78
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,390
Young Master.

79
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,750
Someone is making trouble at Mo's Clinic.

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,380
Miss Mo Jingyu has been bullied.

81
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,700
Let's go.

82
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,150
I...

83
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:33,270
I...

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Who can help me?

85
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,250
He took the medicine from Mo's Clinic.

86
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,650
He was fine.

87
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,300
But now he is dead.

88
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
Mo's Clinic

89
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,310
does whatever they want

90
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,370
after they married the general.

91
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,680
When did I

92
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,540
do whatever I want?

93
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,710
Murder!

94
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,250
The general wants to kill me!

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,190
The general is protecting

96
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,210
his wife.

97
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
He wants us commoners

98
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,550
to shut up.

99
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,200
You said the Mo's clinic poisened you,

100
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,470
I'll verify it.

101
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,710
But you claimed that General Yun

102
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,720
bullied you.

103
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,670
Let me tell you.

104
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,350
General Yun has been guarding the northwest for nearly ten years.

105
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,880
He fought and killed amid bloodshed,

106
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,820
and protect our country.

107
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,149
How can you

108
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,310
slander his reputation?

109
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,269
Honey. Don't worry.

110
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,430
It's my duty

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,790
to deal with this matter.

112
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,870
You may step aside.

113
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
This can't be solved

114
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,110
by sword.

115
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,909
Make way.

116
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,190
Make way.

117
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,550
Make way.

118
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,050
Who is he?

119
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,890
Look, what is this?

120
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,530
Henbane Seed.

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,730
It's a lethal poison.

122
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,150
A lethal poison?

123
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,140
We can't let go

124
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,050
of the culprit easily.

125
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,310
Ask the coroner

126
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,960
to cut off the corpse

127
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,200
of this old man

128
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,030
and check carefully.

129
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,710
There must be something behind this.

130
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes.

131
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,070
Do an autopsy.

132
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:10,850
Do an autopsy.

133
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,110
No need.

134
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,680
If the Mo's Clinic shuts itself down

135
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,200
and pays me some money,

136
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,390
I won't pursue this matter anymore.

137
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,780
Madam.

138
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,690
Listen to the sound of justice.

139
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,720
This is no longer

140
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,950
a matter of your family.

141
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,790
This elderly can't die in vain.

142
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,650
Yes, have an autopsy.

143
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,100
Do an autopsy.

144
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,830
I

145
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,690
have received professional coroner training.

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,560
I'm qualified to be a coroner.

147
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,310
Today,

148
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,700
I'll do an autopsy on the spot.

149
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,000
No, no.

150
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,590
No need.

151
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Since the Mo family won't give us an explanation,

152
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,420
then...

153
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,220
I have to go back

154
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,670
to prepare the funeral.

155
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,540
Run!

156
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,490
Don't go.

157
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,820
He's back to life.

158
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,770
He's back to life.

159
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,040
You...

160
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,880
Where are you going?

161
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,740
Sister, are you alright?

162
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,390
You did well today.

163
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,490
You were quite observant.

164
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,020
Cheers.

165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,170
Then we'll be officially partners.

166
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,640
Your family is unreasonable.

167
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,960
Other than my wedding dress,

168
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,970
there's no sense of joyfulness.

169
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,630
It's a wedding night.

170
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,310
You just treat me with tea.

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,240
I...

172
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,590
I didn’t have time to prepare for the wedding.

173
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,390
I wanted to be a live-in son-in-law.

174
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,830
It would be your Mo family who spent money.

175
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,590
What do you want now?

176
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,590
Lu Rong.

177
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,470
Why did you call him?

178
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:06,680
I...

179
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,120
It's inconvenient for me.

180
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,280
He needs to help me wash up.

181
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,460
We have something more important

182
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,220
to do.

183
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,710
If he's here,

184
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,070
it'll be inconvenient.

185
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Do you want to

186
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,540
be a real couple with me?

187
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,480
Well. If we can't work well together,

188
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,750
I will marry into someone else's family.

189
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,430
I want to

190
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,310
ask you a serious question.

191
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,280
Go ahead.

192
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,310
Where did your money go?

193
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,270
And your cousin Chu Quede...

194
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,140
Chu Dezhao.

195
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,350
That Que Dezhao...

196
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,540
His name is Chu Dezhao.

197
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,110
Could you please refrain from interrupting

198
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,420
or interjecting when I'm speaking

199
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,530
in the future?

200
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,270
Qin's Medicine Shop

201
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,659
is the biggest medicinal herbs

202
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,480
procurement supplier in the capital.

203
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,659
Even after its downfall,

204
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,110
it was further suppressed by our Mo's Clinic,

205
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,370
leaving it unable to recover,

206
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,210
a skinny camel is bigger than a horse.

207
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,770
Your cousin did this to you.

208
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,030
He was bullying you.

209
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,040
You are the first successor.

210
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,210
But all the assets under your name are useless.

211
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,430
Due to this, you can

212
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,370
sue Chu Quede.

213
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,770
Why are you so timid?

214
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,510
You're good.

215
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,730
You're telling the truth.

216
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,270
What is this?

217
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,870
I asked Lu Rong

218
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,510
to inquire the government.

219
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,200
This is the testimony of the two people

220
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,620
who made a scene at Mo's Clinic today.

221
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,870
This is the only copy.

222
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,550
They were instigated by Chu Quede?

223
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,970
It's Chu Dezhao.

224
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,620
Before this,

225
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
I wanted to marry into the Mo family.

226
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,309
Chu Dezhao was afraid that

227
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,510
I would go against him relying on the strength of the Mo family.

228
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,309
So

229
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,860
he wanted to stop me.

230
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,550
I now marry you.

231
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,830
I guess he wants us

232
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,490
to fall out with the Mo family.

233
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,160
He thinks my sister and I

234
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,440
would put on a family feud act

235
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,090
and ruin the Mo's Clinic.

236
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,670
Where is he?

237
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,910
He's right here.

238
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,150
Where?

239
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,750
At the front courtyard of the Qin's Mansion.

240
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,390
Where is this place?

241
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,870
This is a side courtyard.

242
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,830
Why?

243
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,750
Cheer up, boy.

244
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,940
[Side Story]

245
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,350
Brother Yun.

246
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,040
It's

247
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,010
such a comfortable place.

248
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,750
What are you doing?

249
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,050
She said

250
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,830
the wound shouldn't get wet.

251
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,710
Who is she?

252
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,860
Ms. Mo.

253
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,470
No way.

254
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,090
You're so obedient to her.

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,020
Are you saying you married a wife

256
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,070
just to deceive everyone?

257
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,780
Were you actually aiming to be a live-in son-in-law?

258
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,070
You want the Mo family's property too?

259
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,190
I'm a general

260
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,390
with an establishment and a fixed salary.

261
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,630
Why would I care about

262
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,500
their family property?

263
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,050
You're a true hero who can't get over a beauty.

264
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,100
You talk too much.

265
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
How about I lend you

266
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,750
the notes I took at the Live-in Son-in-law Academy?

267
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,180
I took notes very carefully during class.

268
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,750
Who cares about that?
