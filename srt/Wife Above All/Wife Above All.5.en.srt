[Wife Above All]

3
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,700
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,410
You are so unlucky.

5
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,250
You've lost too much.

6
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,590
I can't accept it.

7
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,400
The wet herbs

8
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,710
have already produced toxins.

9
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,170
We can't harm others.

10
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,160
Your legs need nourishment.

11
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,450
You can use them.

12
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,650
You don't have to be so obedient.

13
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,330
We can't keep these herbs.

14
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,280
We should destroy them now.

15
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,310
Something is wrong with the herbs.

16
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,509
What's wrong?

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,430
It has nothing to do with the heavy rain.

18
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,630
Someone poured some aconite-based soup deliberately.

19
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,650
They poisoned the herbs?

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
It must be a huge grudge.

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
It's your cousin Chu Dezhao?

22
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,150
Take care.

23
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,210
Do you remember Young Master Chu’s orders?

24
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,020
Yes.

25
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,010
Yes.

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,140
Take care.

27
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,730
Mr. Jin.

28
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,350
Young Master, you are here.

29
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,020
Greetings, Young Mistress.

30
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,030
Nothing.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,690
We're just looking around.

32
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,220
By the way,

33
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,160
I ordered someone

34
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,780
to get rid of the herbs wetted by the rain

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,060
a few days ago.

36
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,980
Do you know about it?

37
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,750
Yes. I've heard about it.

38
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,710
That's good.

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,370
We don't sell

40
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,780
this kind of herb.

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,690
If I know

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,270
any manager of ours dares to make a profit without permission,

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,210
I will send him

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,130
to the government.

45
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:08,730
Yes.

46
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,620
I dare not.

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,850
I dare not sell it.

48
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:12,980
Honey,

49
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,830
do my nails look good?

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,140
Yes.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,280
So beautiful.

52
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,079
Another day, I'll use hellebore flower juice

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,190
to dye your fingernails.

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,110
I'm sure you'll like it.

55
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,250
Thank you, Darling.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,310
We have some hellebore flowers.

57
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,870
I'll get it for Young Mistress.

58
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,310
We didn't come here in vain this time.

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,200
How dare they

60
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,070
mix poisonous medicine

61
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,310
with good medicine and sell it?

62
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,180
Their conscience has been eaten by a dog.

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,390
Chu Dezhao only cares about harming people.

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
He ignored the patients' lives.

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,340
I didn't expect you

66
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,250
to care about the people.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,070
You actually know how to say something nice.

68
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,670
Do you really believe it?

69
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,630
I do.

70
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,300
I believe everything others say.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,520
You are so smart.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,710
How could you be cheated?

73
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,910
You're lying.

74
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,780
It's true.

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
I was sincere.

76
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,390
You

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,680
look harmless,

78
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,930
but as long as you act smartly,

79
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,310
everything will be wrong.

80
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,050
Okay.

81
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,650
I'll try not to do this again.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Qin is such a good boy.

83
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,000
What should you do in the future?

84
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,310
Be sincere

85
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,510
and be a good person.

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,120
Okay.

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,070
Why are you being shy?

88
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,020
Let's go to work.

89
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,590
What work?

90
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,830
Don't you know?

91
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,659
Yun Zilong dismantled the house last night.

92
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,800
Logically speaking,

93
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,150
we should punish him according to family rules.

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
But my sister is kind.

95
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,770
She sent him to the Live-in Son-in-law Academy.

96
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,150
The teacher there asked

97
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,810
you to help.

98
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,430
Let's go.

99
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,750
Qin, let's go to work.

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Brother Yun.

101
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,710
Stop struggling.

102
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,490
The Live-in Son-in-law Academy

103
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,840
finally recruited

104
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,630
a real live-in husband.

105
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,090
Do you think they will let you go easily?

106
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,800
Believe it or not,

107
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,560
I'll tear down this stupid academy!

108
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,300
I believe you.

109
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,760
General Zhenyuan

110
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,860
can easily

111
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
demolish this place.

112
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,020
But why didn't you

113
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,130
do that?

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,800
Because I've never advocated

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,830
for solving problems through violence.

116
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,270
Are you always like this

117
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,230
or do you want to change

118
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,270
but don't know how to do it?

119
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,780
Let me ask you.

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,770
What’s the most important thing

121
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,220
to be a live-in husband?

122
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,510
Serve my wife.

123
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,230
How?

124
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,590
My wife goes first. I should shut up.

125
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,750
Aren't you learning well?

126
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,790
It's useless.

127
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,320
Let me ask you.

128
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,630
What does Miss Jingyi

129
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,810
want you to do the most?

130
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,980
She...

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,660
She wants me to stay away from her.

132
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,880
She has been

133
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,180
very distant from me these days.

134
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,270
In a few days, my vacation will be over,

135
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,440
and I'll have to handle military affairs regularly.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,790
I'll have even less time.

137
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,200
You want her to pay attention to you.

138
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,190
No.

139
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,370
You want her to see your strengths.

140
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,230
No.

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,950
You want her

142
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,470
to treat you in the way

143
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,030
you treat her.

144
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,950
I said no and I mean it.

145
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,700
Fine.

146
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,590
I have another word.

147
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,670
I can teach you a way

148
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,940
to make your wife respect you.

149
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,760
Can you assure me that I'll be able to learn?

150
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,190
As a live-in husband,

151
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,370
what should you pay attention to

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,330
in front of your wife?

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,840
Manners.

154
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,060
Yes.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,460
Second, all people

156
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,570
have curiosity.

157
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,910
Women are

158
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
very curious.

159
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,460
So what should we do?

160
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,080
To attract her attention.

161
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
What's wrong with me?

162
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,070
Dry cough?

163
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,760
It seems that

164
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,460
I need to make more Tendrilled Fritillary Bulb and Pear Soup...

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,920
So you know

166
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,970
I'm your husband.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,320
For the patients of the clinic.

168
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,640
I don't think there's enough Tendrilled Fritillary Bulb.

169
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,170
I asked you to draw her attention.

170
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,510
But I didn't ask you to hurt yourself.

171
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,300
[Side Story]

172
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,540
I mean,

173
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,500
I've told the teacher

174
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,970
that although you and Ms. Mo

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,490
haven't made any progress,

176
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,110
you’ve been studying

177
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,320
the way of being a live-in husband.

178
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,230
You have mastered all the rules.

179
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,050
The teacher has decided

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,080
to have you replace me as the star student.

181
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,390
But you won't be paid.

182
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,750
It's a free promotion.

183
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,750
Well...

184
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,090
The academic level of your academy

185
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,240
is worth questioning.

186
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,860
What have you learned?

187
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,340
I haven't seen you

188
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,450
doing laundry and cooking.

189
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,100
To be honest,

190
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,510
my homework

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,990
was done by Lu Rong.

192
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,580
He seems to be

193
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,870
interested in these things.

194
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,070
If you need him,

195
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,690
I can lend him to you.

196
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,299
Homework is not important.

197
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,760
But I see you

198
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,510
and Miss Banxia

199
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,990
are always...

200
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,590
Together.

201
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,030
Teach me

202
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,780
how to cotton up.

203
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,810
There are things you can't learn.

204
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,690
It requires some talent.

205
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,010
Talent?

206
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,650
Yes.

207
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,270
If the teacher

208
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,480
dares to hang my portrait

209
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,270
in the academy,

210
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,500
I...

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,940
We agreed not to use violence.

212
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,440
I...

213
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,060
I'll recruit him into the army

214
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,680
and make him my bodyguard.

215
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,100
I will have the authority to beat him

216
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,460
and scold him.

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,800
I can beat

218
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,920
and scold him.

219
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,880
I can beat

220
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,720
and scold him.

221
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,170
I can beat and scold him.
