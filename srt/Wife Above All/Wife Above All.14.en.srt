[Episode 14]

4
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,190
General,

5
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,120
Miss

6
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,690
hasn't eaten anything for two days.

7
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,210
You haven't talked her into it.

8
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:28,910
I...

9
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,900
Some of my brothers

10
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,950
are badly injured.

11
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,150
Can you take a look?

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,030
Okay then.

13
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,860
I'll visit you later.

14
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,380
Are you trying

15
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,550
to draw a dong quai

16
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,010
on the ground?

17
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,630
-Mr. Qin.
-Qin Chonglou.

18
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,790
My sister refuses to eat anything.

19
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,750
Aren't you anxious?

20
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,670
Yes, I am.

21
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,980
Your sister's business is my business.

22
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,990
She refuses to eat...

23
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,930
Is there a possibility that

24
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,120
the food in the General's Mansion is too yucky?

25
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
Probably.

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,760
Well,

27
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,660
I'm willing to serve you.

28
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,230
But if you ask me to make sweet lotus-seed soup

29
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,660
in the barracks...

30
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,520
Are you okay?

31
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,230
Be gentle.

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,550
Slow down.

33
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,180
Watch your steps.

34
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,190
Drink some water.

35
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,270
Drink some water.

36
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,140
Slow down.

37
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,140
Everything went well

38
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,990
with the suppression of bandits.

39
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,150
But on the way back,

40
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,140
the soldiers collapsed one after another.

41
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,110
I checked a few cases just now.

42
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,370
You must have been caught by

43
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,130
the Peach Blossom Miasma during the march.

44
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,030
These symptoms are not that complicated.

45
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,630
What exactly is the reason

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,440
you tried so hard

47
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,080
to bring me here?

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,470
I bought you some snacks.

49
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,110
How about

50
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,110
I get them for you?

51
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,410
I asked someone

52
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,910
to buy this from Guihua Alley in the south.

53
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,140
It may look blackish,

54
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,340
but it is said that even the consorts in the palace

55
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,650
have to reserve in advance for it.

56
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,620
I'm not hungry. Just help yourself to it.

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,740
I know you're in a bad mood,

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,780
and have no appetite.

59
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,530
Just eat a little.

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,280
I really don't feel like eating.

61
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,850
It's all Lie's fault.

62
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,580
He's not good at shopping.

63
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,600
How about this?

64
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:56,850
I'll buy you some more.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,540
No need.

66
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,610
I'll ask Si Qin to buy it.

67
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,590
I'm more at ease

68
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,510
with the ingredients she buys.

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,900
Sounds good.

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,010
Here.

[Ledger]

72
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,540
What is this?

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,680
This is the ledger

74
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,630
my father gave me designedly.

75
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,460
All these years,

76
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,700
I've been managing the clinic.

77
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,590
I can remember the records

78
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,840
more clearly than this ledger.

79
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,330
One of them

80
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,570
must have been replaced.

81
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,030
This is not

82
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,360
the ledger of Mo's Clinic.

83
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,909
It was Prince An.

84
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,320
He was after your father

85
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,270
because he wanted to

86
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,830
frame the Mo family up.

87
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,990
Are you going to...

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
I must avenge

89
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,900
my father's death.

90
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,790
Prince An is our rival.

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,720
I can't involve my sister

92
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,630
in this matter anymore.

93
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,230
Sister.

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,990
Banxia.

95
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,420
Did you really forget

96
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,660
what Father said?

97
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,740
Slow down.

98
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,940
I can't keep up with you.

99
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,180
Sister, calm down.

100
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,210
They are all yours.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,310
Calm down?

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,260
If I calm down,

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,370
my sister will starve to death

104
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,190
in General's Mansion

105
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,280
and turn into ashes!

106
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,630
It's my own business.

107
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,190
Sister!

108
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,680
Even if you say ten thousand times

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,550
that you have nothing to do with me,

110
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,530
you're still my sister.

111
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,960
If you say again

112
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,950
that you and I are not related,

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll pay you back

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,030
all the money of the Mo family

115
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,290
I've spent over the years.

116
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,630
I don't want your money.

117
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,240
You refusing to take my money

118
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
means we're

119
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,010
not yet even.

120
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,560
Since we're not even, we are still related.

121
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,110
Our late father said

122
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,730
we should be united

123
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,490
as a family.

124
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,640
Now you want to break up with me.

125
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,430
Did you not care about

126
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,240
what Father said at all?

127
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,440
I...

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,640
Everyone in the city knows

129
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,909
you two are close.

130
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,010
You can't just

131
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,370
deny she's your sister.

132
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,390
That's right.

133
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,550
It should be a family, isn't it?

134
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,870
Count me in.

135
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,650
Count me in too.

136
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,360
My legs are better now.

137
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,090
I would need Sister

138
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,440
to help me recuperate.

139
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,660
Sister.

140
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,940
Even if Prince An

141
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,280
won't let us go,

142
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,510
as long as

143
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,660
our hearts are together,

144
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,950
he will have some scruples.

145
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

146
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,910
So, what are you afraid of?

147
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,720
I've never been afraid.

148
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,830
Luckily, Father preserved a ledger

149
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,510
by risking his life.

150
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,500
Look.

151
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,909
He had written down

152
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,870
every single detail

153
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,909
of what happened to the Yun family.

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,130
It turns out that the herbs back then

155
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,590
were replaced

156
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,950
after our Yun family took over.

157
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,310
So, it was someone else who replaced them?

158
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Plus this time,

159
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
Prince An swapped the ledger.

160
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,740
I think what happened ten years ago

161
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,400
also has something to do with him.

162
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,400
[Side Story]

163
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,920
You mean?

164
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,000
Ten years ago,

165
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,840
the ledger used for military supplies

166
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,780
encountered the same issue.

167
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,620
You must be young then.

168
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,390
I don't remember the details,

169
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,030
but I know deeply that

170
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,110
what happened to the seal

171
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,590
is no different from ten years ago.

172
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,250
In other words...

173
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,610
I misunderstood Mo Xiang.

174
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,710
Regarding what happened ten years ago,

175
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,070
the real murderer

176
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,580
was Prince An.

177
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,020
So my real enemy

178
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,059
is Prince An.

179
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,230
Did you tell them

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
that you two actually share the same enemy?

181
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,670
Not yet.

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,390
Brother,

183
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,840
can you have some survival instinct?

184
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,270
Why are you still hiding it from her?

185
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,990
Brother.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,930
You are the one who doesn't have any survival instinct.

187
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,860
How should I tell her?

188
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,870
I married you

189
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,900
to kill your father.

190
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,230
You're right.

191
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,150
Idiot.

192
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,890
Well, you're smart for once.

193
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,190
What do you want?

194
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,750
