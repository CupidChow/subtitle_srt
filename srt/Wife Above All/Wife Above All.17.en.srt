00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,670
[Episode 17]

4
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,950
At first,

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,479
there was a leaf-shaped tattoo

6
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,300
on your arm.

7
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm afraid when you grow up,

8
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,840
I can't explain it to you,

9
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,750
so I removed it.

10
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,590
Miss,

11
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,910
Young Master is so competent.

12
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,990
He went to cook in the kitchen

13
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,380
before dawn.

14
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,290
He even cleaned

15
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,470
the yard.

16
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,510
Look.

17
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,070
He also said

18
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,960
although you can

19
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,100
manage herbs by yourself,

20
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,850
he wants to save you some energy,

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,980
so he has managed

22
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,970
the herbs.

23
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,110
He also said

24
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,510
you like light food.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,050
The medicated food can't be greasy.

26
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,990
So, look.

27
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,480
He put a lot of effort

28
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,630
into making this medicinal meal.

29
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,510
Have a taste.

30
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,590
No need.

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,510
Pour it away.

32
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,750
What a pity.

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,110
Let me heat it up.

34
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,270
No need.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,080
There are things

36
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,590
you can't heat up

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,120
once they are getting cold.

38
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,850
Miss.

39
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Miss.

40
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,600
Qin Chonglou.

41
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,720
Are you leaving?

42
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,180
Let me ask you one last time.

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,460
Do you really not like me?

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,190
Didn't I make it clear

45
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,050
previously?

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
I proposed to His Majesty

47
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,550
for the Qin family and Zilong.

48
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,150
Whether it's you or Sister,

49
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,590
it doesn't matter.

50
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,870
Hand.

51
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,090
Then what is this?

52
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,650
I carved it casually, and I forgot it long ago.

53
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,580
What about the hairpin you gave me?

54
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,320
And what we said before?

55
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,120
Together,

56
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,070
we revitalize Qin's Medicine Shop

57
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,680
and open a medicated diet restaurant.

58
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,250
Is it all fake?

59
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,710
You have no feelings at all?

60
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,530
If you're serious, I'll take your word for it.

61
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,550
Let me tell you.

62
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,150
I was just using you.

63
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,780
How could you help me

64
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,780
if I didn't treat you nicely?

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,880
I'll tell you one last time.

66
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,510
I was only using you

67
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,710
from beginning to end.

68
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:55,920
Understand?

69
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,390
Here's your hairpin.

70
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,070
I'm leaving.

71
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,470
Banxia,

72
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,630
there are things

73
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,580
I should face alone.

74
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,170
I made you suffer.

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,420
[Mo's Mansion]

77
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,160
Are you really going to the government office to send the repudiation letter?

78
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,550
This is a marriage bestowed by His Majesty.

79
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,470
Divorce

80
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,080
is against His Majesty's order.

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,080
They tried to harm Father

82
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,070
and the clinic.

83
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,990
I can't tolerate that.

84
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,270
Are you afraid?

85
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,130
You're not afraid.

86
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,490
Neither am I.

87
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,350
If something happens,

88
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,710
we'll bear it together.

89
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,310
Sister,

90
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,600
I can't write a repudiation letter.

91
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
But I wrote a divorce letter.

92
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,070
Young Master!

93
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,240
Young Master!

94
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Bad news!

95
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,280
Young Mistress and Ms. Mo went to the government office

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,520
and insisted on divorce.

97
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,320
Let her be.

98
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,030
No.

99
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,360
There's something more serious.

100
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,650
His Majesty got very angry

101
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,680
and put Young Mistress and Ms. Mo

102
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,860
in prison.

103
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,960
His Majesty's gone to the villa.

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,350
Your Majesty.

105
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,620
It's all

106
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,620
my fault.

107
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,140
Your Majesty.

108
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,690
Your Majesty, I'm guilty.

109
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

110
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,710
Fine. Let's get to the point.

111
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,810
Back then, my father transported the provisions.

112
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,250
My whole family was convicted

113
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,440
due to the fabrication of herbs.

114
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,120
I think Mo Xiang was behind it.

115
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,500
After that,

116
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,930
I used Mr. Qin

117
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,780
to deceive Your Majesty

118
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,390
for the marital decree.

119
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,770
My doing is disloyal and unjust.

120
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,810
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,340
You used him to deceive me?

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,960
But Qin Chonglou just said

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
in order to retrieve Qin's Medicine Shop,

124
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,930
he used you to deceive me.

125
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,820
You two...

126
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,490
Do you really think I dare not

127
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,430
punish you two?

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,780
I should have put you two

129
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,920
in jail

130
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,580
together with Mo sisters.

131
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,800
Let me see

132
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,350
how stubborn you are.

133
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,920
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,990
I did it alone.

135
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,690
It has nothing to do with others.

136
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,590
Your Majesty, I...

137
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,790
Enough.

138
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,140
You only have a few repetitive words.

139
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,630
How about this?

140
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,890
I'll give you two a chance

141
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,790
to atone for your mistakes.

142
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,190
Qulingguan is in danger.

143
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,350
I guess the garrison

144
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,409
has received the news.

145
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:56,850
If you can suppress the rebellion,

146
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,690
you'll get to wipe the slate clean, how?

147
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,390
Your Majesty,

148
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,350
I'm willing to lead the army.

149
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,370
Your Majesty, please give me troops.

150
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,850
What are you laughing at? You don't deserve it.

151
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,370
Yes, Your Majesty.

152
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,600
Go quickly!

153
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,070
Well...

154
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,230
-I'm leaving.
-I'm leaving.

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,510
[Side Story]

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,270
Brother Yun.

157
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,980
Before this,

158
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,470
you didn't get to take revenge.

159
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,230
And I was sick.

160
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,710
We had no hope

161
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,720
for the future.

162
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,630
But they have.

163
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,530
They've been staying in the clinic.

164
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,270
That clinic is where

165
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,650
you experience the fickleness of human nature the most.

166
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,120
The clinic

167
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,950
means everything to them.

168
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,650
What about us?

169
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,020
We

170
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,309
are different.

171
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,740
How?

172
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,390
I've given all my family property

173
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,460
to them.

174
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,510
I know

175
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,130
you must have sent people

176
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,280
to protect them day and night.

177
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,570
Then why can't I do

178
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,950
what I want?

179
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,280
Besides,

180
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,900
this is His Majesty's order.

181
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,600
In that case,

182
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,400
we should obey His Majesty's order.
