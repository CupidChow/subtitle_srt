1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,210
Let’s break up

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,179
What?

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,430
Did I do something wrong?

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,759
No…

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,070
It’s just…

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,460
I've lost feelings for you..

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,989
You seeing another girl?

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,689
Not a girl

9
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,464
Another guy…?

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,252
Babe~

11
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:35,068
You’re here?

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,980
I’m pregnant with your baby

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,860
What?

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,010
We can’t end it like this

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,550
You’re lying

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,760
Who the hell are you?

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,129
I’m infertile

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,750
What?

19
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,319
Cut!

20
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,280
Yeah Geonwoo

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,190
Geonwoo I knew it from the moment

22
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,651
you were a kid

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,399
Number one male actor people want to hug!

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,730
Number one!

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,690
Hey look

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,512
They’re all here just to see you!

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,940
I guess so

28
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:22,282
Our drama ratings are insane right now!

29
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:26,052
Geonwoo you’re a jackpot! A total jackpot!

30
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,954
Is he a god or something

31
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,670
He is..

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,060
He boosted a dying show by ten percent just showing up

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,130
Is that why you are all down?

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,026
After losing the lead role?

35
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:41,790
What can I do…

36
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,004
That’s what it’s like being a nobody

37
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,770
Jackpot jackpot jackpot!

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,401
Let’s move on to the next scene

39
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,668
Yeah

40
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,668
Yeah yeah sure!

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,317
Ready action!

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,240
Why would a celebrity even agree to interview me…

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,910
Just go straight in

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,837
What am I a bull?

45
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,190
With how aggressive you are I wouldn’t be surprised

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,660
Want me to charge at you first?

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,990
Then I’ll dodge real smooth

48
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,440
Good for you..

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,010
What about him?

50
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,480
(Ten million ticket actor Kim Geonwoo at a new film premiere…)

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,635
Does that even make sense?
(Ten million ticket actor Kim Geonwoo at a new film premiere…)

52
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:30,719
Even if I spent everything I have

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,100
I couldn’t buy one second of his time

54
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,040
What do I do?

55
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,121
Want me to help?

56
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:36,275
Should I pull some strings?

57
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,900
Let’s not get carried away

58
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,590
I’m already running out of time as it is

59
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,180
Maybe I should’ve become famous too

60
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,570
Then I could’ve seen you beg like that

61
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,220
Looks like this life’s a fail for you

62
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,070
Try again in the next one

63
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,906
This isn’t easy

64
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,852
Hello?

65
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,136
What? My car?

66
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,783
I just left it there for a minute

67
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,899
Okay I get it

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,999
What is it?

69
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,990
I think my car got towed

70
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,611
What?

71
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,979
I’m really sorry

72
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,130
Looks like you’ll have to take a taxi

73
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,809
You know I can’t ride with a stranger driving

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,590
Yeah… I know I know

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,080
It’s fine.. the place isn’t that far anyway

76
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,394
What you’re gonna walk?

77
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,541
Yeah

78
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,997
You want me standing around forever until you get the car back?

79
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,001
No yeah not that

80
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,865
Bro

81
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,079
Take it off

82
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,626
Huh?

83
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,150
Want me to help you?

84
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,351
Hey hey hey no no no

85
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,086
Hey hey hey

86
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,965
You seriously haven’t changed at all since you were a kid

87
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
You’re the same too

88
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,370
Really?

89
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,910
Yeah

90
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,410
Same height too

91
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,330
You little…

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,820
Huh?

93
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,150
You had an older brother?

94
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,670
You didn’t know?

95
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,220
How come I’ve never seen him before?

96
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,307
Well…

97
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,830
He was always busy growing up

98
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,750
So I barely saw him too

99
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,059
Is it awkward between you two?

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,820
Not really

101
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,550
I just don’t really like him

102
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,166
Why?

103
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,949
It’s just…

104
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,936
What do you mean?

105
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,906
Something like jealousy I guess

106
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Ever since I was a kid

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,699
my parents never even wished me happy birthday

108
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,880
They were always busy taking care of him..

109
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,550
Even the day we first met

110
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,758
You saved me when I was getting picked on for my torn clothes

111
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,960
That explains it…

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,096
I always wondered why you looked like that

113
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,249
even though your family wasn’t poor

114
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,100
Back then you really felt like a hero

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,240
Like you had this glow

116
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,603
What about now?

117
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,472
Well… you still glow just in a messed up way

118
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,250
I told you not to overdo it

119
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,330
Hey you!

120
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,940
I’m leaving

121
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,510
Such a pain in the ass…

122
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,279
Who the hell are you?

123
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,380
You had a nightmare incident as a child actor

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,750
Oh yeah

125
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,770
You mean when I was kidnapped?

126
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,507
That must’ve been terrifying back then

127
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,336
It wasn’t exactly fun

128
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,690
I think I was eight at the time

129
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,442
I was acting as Kangho’s younger version back then

130
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,066
There was a scene where I was riding in the secretary’s car

131
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,736
The route was just supposed to be a loop around the neighborhood

132
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,561
But the driver wasn’t part of the cast

133
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,570
He drove straight onto the main road and I was taken

134
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,131
Just for a short time

135
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,294
What were you feeling back then?

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,980
Honestly I didn’t even know I was being kidnapped

137
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,970
When I asked hin where are we going?

138
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,278
He didn’t answer at all

139
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,790
If that person had been violent

140
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,019
it could’ve left a serious trauma

141
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,656
I heard you were rescued pretty quickly

142
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,793
Yeah luckily the car was surrounded not long after

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,840
And he…

144
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,912
handed me over without resisting which I’m thankful for

145
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,640
After that you participated in campaigns

146
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,530
against crimes targeting children

147
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,290
and made donations to children’s hospitals

148
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,770
You’ve done a lot of good since then

149
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,190
Do you still have any trauma?

150
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,219
Uh…

151
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,950
I guess there’s one thing

152
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,463
I can’t ride in a car when a stranger’s driving

153
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,700
I see

154
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,920
Thank you for the interview Geonwoo

155
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,148
Yeah

156
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,858
Good work everyone

157
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,054
Who booked this low-rent interview anyway??

158
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,270
Well…

159
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,850
They say it’s a network run by the CEO’s relatives

160
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,260
All he cares about is money no wonder he’s going bald

161
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,739
Hey watch your mouth…
