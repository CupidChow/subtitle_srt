1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Will you be okay.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,200
If our kids don’t get engaged.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Let it stay a secret love,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,920
like the lyrics say.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,040
When will I get to be with Ice?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,600
There will be a day.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,480
Happy birthday, honey.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,760
Mom...

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,440
I hope you’re the happiest you’ve ever been.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,240
From now on…

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,840
let me be your boyfriend.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,800
I liked you ever since

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,880
the first moment you stood in front of my house.

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,680
Did you have a nightmare?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,280
Is there any way

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,080
to make you feel better?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,160
Maybe I need to settle that thing.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,640
Or…

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
you could just sleep hugging me every night.

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,880
If that’s the case,

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
I’ll keep hugging you

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,160
and tell you goodnight every night.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,160
When will you ever understand what I’m saying?

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
It’s just commenting on someone’s picture on IG.

25
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,920
Why is it such a big deal?

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Commenting on a girl’s IG saying, so cute.

27
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,240
Thai men’s type.

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
Was that all really just a comment?

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
What did I do wrong by complimenting a friend?

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
What’s your problem?

31
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Sea is super cool.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,920
And Lanee is seriously gorgeous.

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
And Saint is damn handsome, bro.

34
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,840
And Ice has a pretty smile.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
See?

36
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,160
I compliment all my friends like this.

37
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,640
And have you ever complimented me even once?

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,440
I’m your boyfriend now, you know.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
And when Pas asked what I am to you,

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
you still said we’re just roommates.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,240
I just…

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,840
You never think about my feelings at all.

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,760
You know that?

44
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,840
We’ve been like this since the beginning.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,800
Now that we’re dating,

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,880
you want me to change everything

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,079
into what you want me to be?

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
If I change everything,

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,840
then I won’t have a life of my own anymore, right?

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Fine.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Then you can go live your life.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,200
I think we should take some time apart

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,320
and think about ourselves.

54
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,240
Guys, what do you think is going on?

55
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,920
What's wrong with him?

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,520
Let me tell you,

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,280
my friend, if you don't genuinely feel guilty,

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
he's very hard to win back.

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,440
I get it.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Relationships can be hard.

61
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Couples need lots of adjusting.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Hang in there.

63
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,560
Who’s gonna go win him back?

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,959
He’s the one who needs to win me back.

65
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Why are you hugging me so tight?

66
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
I’ve wanted to hug you like this for so long.

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
I’m so happy

68
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,320
to have you as my boyfriend.

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
Same here.

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
You’re my boyfriend now.

71
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Do you want to do something else?

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
Right now you can do anything.

73
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,800
Easy…

74
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,159
you’ll get hurt.

75
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
Are you sure that

76
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
you want it easy?

77
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
But today,

78
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,800
let's use my room.

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,240
Mm.

80
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,400
Ten…

81
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,960
Can I sleep in your room?

82
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,520
I don’t have a dorm anymore.

83
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
Sleeping isn’t the problem.

84
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,960
But are you planning to stay forever or what?

85
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,320
Hm?

86
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
Yeah.

87
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Once I get back on my feet, I’ll get out myself.

88
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
You sure?

89
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,680
Sure.

90
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
Ugh.

91
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
If you an’t sleep.

92
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
Then go back to him.

93
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
I can sleep.

94
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,720
I’m just hot, that’s all.

95
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,640
Clean your aircon sometimes, man.

96
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,200
So now it’s my aircon’s fault?

97
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,400
Pay for the cleaning then.

98
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
I told you already,

99
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,560
if you didn’t shower,

100
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
don’t get on the bed.

101
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,800
Go shower.

102
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
Too lazy.

103
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
Fine, I’ll sleep on the floor then.

104
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,640
It’s comfortable anyway.

105
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
How could it be comfortable?

106
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,280
Huh?

107
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,720
You’re all sticky.

108
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,600
Come on, get up.

109
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Go.

110
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,960
Come on.

111
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,520
Get up quickly.

112
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,280
How is it not comfortable?

113
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,040
Just sleeping while hugging you

114
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
is already comfortable.

115
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,200
If one day

116
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,160
I don’t let you hug me,

117
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
what will you do?

118
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,000
I don’t know.

119
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I’ve never thought about that day.

120
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,760
You…

121
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,120
do you not want to touch me

122
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
because you're embarrased?

123
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
I haven’t even said anything yet.

124
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
Forget other people.

125
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,080
For me.

126
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
I only care about my boyfriend.

127
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
The sun.

128
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
Want a picture?

129
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,760
I’ll take it for you.

130
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,280
Mm.

131
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,640
Is it flipped the right way?

132
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,640
One.

133
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Two.

134
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,640
Two fingers again?

135
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,040
That’s enough.

136
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,760
I want to take a picture with you more.

137
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,240
We’re dating,

138
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,880
so we should have lots of couple photos, right?

139
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,760
(Thank you for coming into my life)

140
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,440
(as a ray of sunshine,)

141
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,200
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

142
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,920
(from once withered to bloom again.)

143
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,960
(Thank you for making everyday)

144
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,680
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

145
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,560
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

146
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,360
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

147
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,520
That’s cute.

148
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
(Loy Krathong Gen Z)

149
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Hello.

150
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,080
What would you like?

151
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,880
Should we get this one?

152
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,880
How much is this?

153
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,720
Twenty baht.

154
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,800
Perfect.

155
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,880
Here.

156
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,200
No need for change.

157
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Thank you.

158
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,560
Let’s go.

159
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
Do you want to eat it now?

160
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,319
Mm.

161
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,160
Oh!

162
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,760
What are you two doing here on a secret date?

163
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,440
Eh?

164
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Or are you turning from a shipped couple

165
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,359
into a real couple?

166
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,119
Mm…

167
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
you guys can think whatever you want.

168
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,960
Not denying.

169
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,560
So that means..

170
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,800
Waaahhh!

171
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Told you!

172
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,520
Anyway,

173
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,640
have you ever prayed at the shrine behind the uni?

174
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,320
They say if couples pray there,

175
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
their love lasts long.

176
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,040
The shrine…

177
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,200
the old shrine students go to, right?

178
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah.

179
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
But actually it’s not only for love.

180
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,720
That shrine,

181
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,160
it’s famous for granting wishes.

182
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,280
Oh!

183
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,640
The top contender for

184
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Loy Krathong Beauty Queen this year is here.

185
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,080
We’re cheering for you!

186
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,840
Thank you.

187
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,840
What were you guys talking about?

188
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,800
We were talking about

189
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,320
the legend of the shrine behind our uni.

190
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Oh.

191
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,920
Are you being serious or joking?

192
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,720
I mean her.

193
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,640
If she hasn’t had a drink,

194
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
she always goes back and forth telling fortunes.

195
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,440
Not true!

196
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
I’m accurate, right?

197
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,880
But…

198
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,080
I’m only accurate when I’m drunk.

199
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,560
So that means you’re only accurate then?

200
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,320
Like when you read my palm?

201
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,080
Mm.

202
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,640
But…

203
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,600
no one is going to take it seriously, right?

204
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,720
Right?

205
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Why are you laughing like that?

206
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,320
Normally,

207
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,920
how many incense sticks do you use at a shrine?

208
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,120
Probably five.

209
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Then why did Alex light just one?

210
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
Whatever.

211
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,240
I’ll light it.

212
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay.

213
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
Come.

214
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Can we really trust Cookie?

215
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:45,840
Mm.

216
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
It doesn’t hurt to try.

217
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Come.

218
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
May our love

219
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
have no obstacles.

220
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,000
May the two of us

221
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,680
stay together for a long, long time.

222
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,880

225
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,880
the student records about suicide cases

226
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
are really confidential.

227
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But I noticed something strange.

228
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,680
So…

229
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,440
But...

230
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,000
if the information might help others,

231
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,280
then it would be fine, right?

232
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,160
Yes.

233
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,320

Look at this.

240
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,400
Isn’t it strange

241
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,120
that lately

242
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,200
the suicide rates shot up like crazy?

243
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,320

246
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,680
There's another thing,

247
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,560
the freshman named Alex.

248
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Book, you know him, right?

249
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,600
It's just that..

250
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,800
It’s really strange.

251
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,760
He doesn’t have any attendance record

252
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,680
for any classes except for Prof.Mint's.

253
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,920
I don’t know

254
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,440
how close you are to him.

255
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,280

Yes.

258
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
I’ll check on him.

259
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,840
Good.

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,560

And it looks like they were all good-looking too.

282
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,120

283
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,080

284
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,880

not long after the semester started.

286
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,520
And those symptoms…

287
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,320
They’re the same as mine.

288
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,360
Back when my leaked clip came out.

289
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,400
And everything happened after 2018.

290
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Since the year Prof.Mint started working here.

291
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
And if any year has a death,

292
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,320
he would skip that faculty the next year

293
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
and rotate to another one

294
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,320
so people won’t notice the pattern.

295
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,440
Damn…

296
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,720
He's being really careful.

297
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,360
Which means that actually, this year,

298
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Alex shouldn’t have been the victim.

299
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,000
But Alex himself tried to become the victim.

300
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
And the motive…

301
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,880
It’s probably about his brother, right?

302
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,160
I think so too.

303
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,080
He changed both his first and last name

304
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,000
because he didn’t want anyone to recognize him.

305
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
And the day Alex’s brother died

306
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,880
was October 31st, 2020.

307
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,680
Which is Loy Krathong day.

308
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,880
So if Alex came to pray at the shrine today,

309
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,080
that means he won’t be free this evening, right?

310
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,000
Or maybe…

311
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,040
he came to pray before doing something.

312
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
I have no idea what Alex is planning.

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,680
But damn, it’s worrying as hell.

314
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,920
Okay then, let’s split up and handle this.

315
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,680
I’ll be the one to beat the crap out of Prof.Mint.

316
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,760
No you won’t.

317
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,320
You’re going to Prof.Fah’s house with Book.

318
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,360
Huh?

319
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,160
You’re smart.

320
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
You’re the one who could talk

321
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,840
and convince Prof.Fah.

322
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,360
Yeah.

323
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,120
And you..

324
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,040
you’re the closest to Prof.Fah out of all of us.

325
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,360
So you probably understand her the best.

326
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,000

327
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,840

328
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,600
Good luck to you too.

329
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,880
If you’re ready,

330
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
you may start.

331
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,640

Hi.

335
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,040
What is it?

336
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
It’s urgent,

337
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,600
and only you can help.

338
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
Since you teach PR,

339
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,600
my friends and I

340
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,960
plan to use the media to expose the truth.

341
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
That’s a big topic.

342
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
And what truth do you plan to expose?

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,960
That there’s a professor in our university

344
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,880
who lures freshmen into having sex

345
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,480
and films them for blackmail.

346
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Do you remember these students?

347
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Book, what are you talking about?

348
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,400
No.

349
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,440
I don’t remember.

350
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,600
You don’t remember,

351
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,040
or you don’t want to remember?

352
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,000
Do you really not remember the students

353
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,080
who attempted suicide

354
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
and eventually dropped out?

355
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,200
What do you want?

356
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,080
And you two?

357
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,760
Ice and I

358
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,640
will find a way into Prof.Mint’s room

359
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,520
and help Alex

360
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,520
and livestream everything using the same camera

361
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,680
he uses to record the students.

362
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,120
To beat someone that cautious,

363
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,400
we need to expose him

364
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,280
so he can't make any excuses.

365
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,920
Should I call the police?

366
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,480
I don’t think so.

367
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
It’s too risky.

368
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,040
Right now,

369
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,920
the person who can help us the most

370
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,360
is the one who’s always helped Prof.Mint

372
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,960
Hey.

373
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,160
Be careful.

374
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

375
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You too.

376
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,320
Zoom.

377
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Hey!

378
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,160
That's mine!

379
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,800
I said let go!

380
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,720
Let me go!

381
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,280
Let go!

382
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Go first, Saint.

383
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,760
I’ll handle him.

384
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Let me go, fucker!

385
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,680
I’m not letting go.

386
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
You escaped him already.

387
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,800
Why go back and put yourself in danger again?

388
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
Victims..

389
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,400
Do they ever really escape?

390
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
But this is my last job.

391
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,280
He said he’d let me go after this.

392
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,160
But for us.

393
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,920
Well, I won’t let you do this job.

394
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,400
Hey.

395
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
Hey.

396
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
Do you know

397
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,800
how many people died

398
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
or dropped out because of your job?

399
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,160
So what?

400
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,360
In the end, I still have to take care of my dad.

401
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
About your dad.

402
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,920
Don’t worry.

403
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
Saint and I

404
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,040
will help pay for his care.

405
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,160
You can relax.

406
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,880
You really think

407
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,840
we can beat him?

408
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,160
Even if our chances are only fifty–fifty…

409
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
I’m sure.

410
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,800
If you help us,

411
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
our chances get higher for sure.

412
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,840
Zoom…

413
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
Didn’t you want to start a new life?

414
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Why not try just once?

415
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,960
(Mint: Is everything okay, Zoom?)

416
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,000
Hard to believe

417
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,520
you’re the one who asked me out today.

418
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,440
Did you know,

419
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,840
that on a dark-moon night like this,

420
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
the moon

421
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,720
has a huge influence on human emotions?

422
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,880
Oh really?

423
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,240
How so?

424
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
It’s the kind of day that, statistically,

425
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,840
people tend to do something crazy.

426
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,440
Or commit crimes.

427
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Wow.

428
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
You really know a lot, huh.

429
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,640
Yes.

430
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Here.

431
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,520
Have some water.

432
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,760
Thank you.

433
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,480
You look tired lately.

434
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Drink some so you’ll feel refreshed.

435
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,360
Okay.

436
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,880
How is it?

437
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
Feeling better?

438
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,240
Much better.

439
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,200
(Zoom: Everything is going smoothly.)

440
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,480
I hope your boyfriend

441
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,120
doesn’t mess things up.

442
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,719
My boyfriend is smarter than you think.

443
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,719
I’ll be watching.

444
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Now all we need is Prof.Fah.

445
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,120
I don't know how things are going on that end.

446
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,800
Even though I sent you that link.

447
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,240
The only person who has the password.

448
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,440
Is Prof.Mint.

449
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,640
Even Prof.Fah doesn’t know?

450
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,120
Someone that cautious.

451
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,920
Wouldn’t tell anyone.

452
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,600
I told you fighting Prof.Mint.

453
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,960
Is not easy.

454
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,200
And where did you find these three kids?

455
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,000
Their student records.

456
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
And how do I know any of this is true?

457
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,680
Please believe us.

458
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,720
You’ve seen that I’ve always been on Prof.Mint’s side.

459
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,040
If you still don’t believe us.

460
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
Could you at least

461
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
enter the password for us?

462
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,360
What password?

463
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Why would I do that?

464
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,880
The link where Prof.Mint recorded

465
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,040
and blackmailed the freshmen.

466
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,160
If you open it and there’s nothing.

467
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,960
Then you can prove for yourself.

468
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,200
That everything you believed,

469
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,600
was right.

470
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,440
And how would I know the password?

471
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,920
Has Prof.Mint ever told you the password?

472
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,520
(Ice: Prof.Mint is heading up.)

473
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,320
And that concludes

474
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
the answers from the previous contestant.

475
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,240
And for our next contestant

476
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,600
The next person to answer the question.

477
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,440
Number 3, Ms.Lanee, please come up.

478
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:07,160
Woo! Woo!

479
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,000
The question is.

480
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,480
Imagine this.

481
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,280
If you were just an ordinary student

482
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
and you were oppressed by someone with power.

483
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,560
What would you do?

484
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Hey!

485
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,800
What was that?

486
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,320
No, no.

487
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
If you’re sleepy.

488
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,320
You can sleep first.

489
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Huh?

490
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
What’s happening?

491
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,320
Huh?

492
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,320
What’s wrong with it?

493
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,280
There’s no signal.

494
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,120
Give it here, I’ll fix it.

495
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,760
Okay.

496
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,440
It’s working.

497
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,960
Is that Prof.Mint?

498
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,160
Zoom,

499
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,600
it’s your cue.

500
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Zoom.

501
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,640
Zoom.

502
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,920
Zoom.

503
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,120
Zoom.

504
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,240
Zoom.

505
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,240
Zoom.

506
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,160
You’re dead! Hey!

507
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,440
Shit.

508
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,000
Hey!

509
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,520
Agh!

510
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,640
You’re not asleep yet?

511
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,120
How the hell could I sleep?

512
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,800
You killed my older brother!

513
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,120
Remember that naive pharmacy kid

514
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,520
you tricked into having sex?

515
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,880
That kid was my brother.

516
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,200
I did everything.

517
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,160
Hoping that one day you’d get what you deserve.

518
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,160
But I knew karma

519
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,440
wouldn’t catch up to someone as rotten

520
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,680
as you fast enough.

521
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,640
So I had to do everything myself.

522
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,560
Impressive effort.

523
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,200
So what?

524
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Do you really think

525
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,640
you can beat me?

526
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,280
Good evening, Prof.Mint.

527
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,520
Agh!

528
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,280
Hey.

529
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,960
Are you okay?

530
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,480
I’m okay.

531
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,520
Argh!

532
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:56,760
Argh!

533
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,520
Argh!

534
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,600
Saint.

535
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,040
Hey.

536
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,760
Saint.

537
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,560
He looks familiar.

538
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,080
Saint!

539
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,960
It really is Saint.

540
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,200
It’s Saint.

541
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,360
What happened?

542
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,200
What is all this?

543
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,800
The truth, uncle.

544
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
The truth that nobody ever knew.

545
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,880
That Ice

546
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,240
and many first-year students at our university.

547
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,640
Have been victimized by Prof.Mint for years.

548
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,840
Call the police.

549
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,000
Our students are in danger! Quickly!

550
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,120
Don’t worry.

551
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,200
The police cars

552
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
and ambulances are already on their way.

553
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,920
We’ve planned all of this.

554
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,440
And we believe Ice and Saint will handle him.

555
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,520
You don't like living the good comfortable rich life,

556
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,000
right?

557
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,640
Huh?

558
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,480
Always trying to be the good guy?

559
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
In case you wanted to know.

560
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,400
Why I choose victims who are all similar.

561
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
It’s because people like them.

562
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,160
Are stupid.

563
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,480
They have nowhere else to go.

564
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,800
No matter how hard they fight.

565
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,920
They could never beat me.

566
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,720
I’m curious.

567
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
If these clips

568
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,840
were released to the public

569
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,920
because of nosy do-gooders like you.

570
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,680
How would you feel?

571
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,560
Shit, what are you doing?

572
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,320
Hey, calm down.

573
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,160
Alex, calm down.

574
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,920
Calm down.

575
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Let me go!

576
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,200
Is there anything else that’s important to him?

577
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,160
If it’s not my birthday.

578
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,440
Not his birthday.

579
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,680
Then what number could it be?

580
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,600
Or maybe it’s something important.

581
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,680
But looks unimportant

582
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,200
so no one would guess, professor.

583
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,880
The only thing left is our anniversary.

584
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,040
The day Mint said was the most important day for him.

585
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,160
I’ll try entering it.

586
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,320
But if it’s wrong this time, I’m not doing it again.

587
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,160
You just wait.

588
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,440
How many lives

589
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,680
will die along with your brother.

590
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,080
Where did it go?

591
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,600
Hey.

592
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,920
Where did it go?

593
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,360
Looks like your acting class.

594
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,440
Won’t be taught anymore, professor.

595
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,960
Professor, please calm down.

596
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Mud, it’s not true, right?

597
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,840
I destroyed my students.

598
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,760
But we can still fix the present, professor.

599
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,480
It’s true. It’s true, professor.

600
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,000
Professor, please calm down.

601
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,120
What should I do?

602
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,920
Then do what you should do, professor.

603
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,800
Do you think this

604
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,440
can stop me?

605
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,720
Exactly.

606
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,200
Then professor, before you do anything.

607
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,320
Why won't you take a look at this first?

608
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,320
Prof.Mint.

609
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,280
It’s really him.

610
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,080
Please admit your wrongdoing, professor.

611
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,320
I'm really sorry.

612
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,040
I shouldn’t have done this.

613
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,000
I surrender.

614
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,400
You mean?

615
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,320
I surrender to all of you.

616
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,680
Whatever you want to do to me.

617
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,400
Go ahead.

618
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,680
Good, surrendering is the right choice.

619
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,880
Hey, don’t.

620
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,520
Shit!

621
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,120
Let go!

622
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,080
Agh!

623
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
You still won’t stop pretending?

624
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,200
Pretending?

625
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,000
If I weren’t good at acting.

626
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
How would I be able to teach acting?

627
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,240
Huh?

628
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,560
Professor, please don’t.

629
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,040
Don’t come any closer.

630
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
Good, everyone’s here.

631
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,400
Now everyone will see.

632
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,960
What my last class of the day

633
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,280
looks like.

634
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,520
Should I teach a class

635
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,760
on murder?

636
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,600
Hey!

637
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,280
Zoom, keep watching the signal for me.

638
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,760
And contact the police,

639
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,720
they’re almost here.

640
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,880
I trust you.

641
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,560
Just wait a little longer.

642
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
I'll do everything

643
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,480
to make sure Dad

644
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,280
can't do anything to you or me this time.

645
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,040
And I'll make all your dreams

646
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,080
come to life.

647
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,440
You came here to kill me, didn't you?

648
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,880
But you only prepared this much?

649
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,840
I guess today's going to be a reunion

650
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,320
with your brother.

651
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,680
Don't!

652
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,960
I'll show you what a good person is like.

653
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,680
Saint!
