1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,400
The freshman named Alex.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,600
He doesn’t have any attendance record

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,320
for any classes except for Prof.Mint's.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,280
Okay then, let’s split up and handle this.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,280
You’re going to Prof.Fah’s house with Book.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,520
As for Sea and Lanee.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,160
And you two?

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,760
Ice and I will find a way into Prof.Mint’s room

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,400
and help Alex

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
and livestream everything using the same camera

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,720
he uses to record the students.

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,120
Good evening, Prof.Mint.

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Agh!

14
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,920
Saint!

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,320
Now everyone will see

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,520
what my last class of the day will look like.

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,120
Should I teach a class on murder?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
(Elevator out of order - under maintenance)

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,240
You came here to kill me, didn’t you?

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,440
And this is all you prepared?

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,360
Looks like today

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,600
you’re finally going to get a reunion

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,040
with your brother.

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,720
Don’t!

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
Ahhh!

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
Hey!

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,800
Stop it!

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
Yes, officer.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,320
Room 7110.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,720
The hotel I mentioned.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,440
Yes.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,360
I admit to all charges.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,280
Living comfortably isn’t your thing?

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Huh?

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
You want to be a hero?

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,720
You want to be a good person?

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Hey!

38
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Then today I’ll teach you

39
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,240
what being a good person really looks like.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Saint!

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Aaaah!

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,000
Agh!

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Saint!

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
Saint!

45
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,560
You ruined my life and that wasn’t enough,

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
now you go after my boyfriend too?!

47
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,880
Ugh!

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,240
Ugh!

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,600
Saint!

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Apologize to my brother!

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,600
Ugh!

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,480
I’ll send you to be with my brother.

53
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,000
Alex!

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,480
No!

55
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,680
Alex, stop it!

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
Alex, that’s enough!

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
Ice, let go of me.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,640
I’m sending him to be with my brother.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,560
Do you think your brother would even

60
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
want him to be with him?

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you think he would want you in prison, Alex?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,920
Let go of me!

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,560
If he dies,

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
then he won’t have to take responsibility!

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,840
Let him live with the evil he’s done.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
That’s the real punishment.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
You know that, don’t you, Alex?

68
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Huh?!

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,880
Saint!

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Saint!

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,360
Stop!

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Get down on the ground.

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,440
You’re under arrest.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Now!

75
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,400
Get down!

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Let go of me! Officer, please help my boyfriend!

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Get down!

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Let go of me!

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Stay still.

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Please wait here for a moment.

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,880
I’ll send the medical team in.

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,120
Saint.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
It’s…

84
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,280
It’s over now, Ice.

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
You…

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
you don’t have to have nightmares anymore.

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,400
Mm.

88
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,240
Saint, you have to stay with me.

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
Saint.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Do you remember what you once told me?

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
That you’d help make my dreams come true,

92
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
that I could live the life I wanted.

93
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,880
I’ve only just started living my own life.

94
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,920
Please don’t leave me yet.

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I…

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,840
I love you.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,760
I love you too, Saint.

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,760
I’m going to class, okay?

99
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
I’ll be back.

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,160
How is Saint doing?

101
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
He’s out of danger now,

102
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,280
but he still needs time to recover.

103
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,320
So I came to ask if I could file

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
a leave request for Saint,

105
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
maybe about two weeks.

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,240
Mm.

107
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,960
Don’t worry about it,

108
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
I’ll take care of everything.

109
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Now let me tell you some good news.

110
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
The university has officially issued

111
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
an apology to you and Saint,

112
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,760
and has revoked all disciplinary actions

113
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,480
that were previously imposed on both of you.

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
(Clarification on Disciplinary Action Revision)

115
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,200
(To: Mr. Karun Thongdee)

116
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,520
(This is to announce the cancellation)

117
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,920
(of disciplinary punishment)

118
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
That’s not all.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,120
This part is your scholarship.

120
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
The university will

121
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
refund all tuition fees you’ve already paid,

122
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,960
and you’ll receive a full scholarship

123
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,640
until graduation,

124
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,600
including living expenses.

125
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
5,000 baht per month.

126
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,440
Thank you, Professor Sara.

127
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,600
I should tell you

128
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,000
this was actually the president’s idea.

129
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,520
Mr.Khom?

130
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,039
Yes.

131
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,840
If you’re okay with it…

132
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,720
just sign here.

133
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,880
Yes.

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,720
(Karun Thongdee)

135
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480
Thank you.

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
From now on, I wish you good luck.

137
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,800
Think of this as a reset.

138
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,160
A brand-new start.

139
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,280
May I choose not to start over?

140
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,080
Hm?

141
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I’d rather just keep going.

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,640
Alright.

143
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
Sure.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Starting over is exhausting, right?

145
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,040
Yes.

146
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,400
If you need anything, come talk to me.

147
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,240
Or if there’s anything I can help with,

148
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,160
let me know.

149
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you.

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I’ll take my leave now.

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Let me help.

152
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,800
Ice.

153
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,080
It's fine.

154
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Is this Professor Mint’s stuff?

155
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,360
They asked me to throw it away.

156
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,520
I’ll carry it for you.

157
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,040
Ice,

158
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
you don’t have to do this.

159
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,000
The more you do,

160
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
the worse I feel.

161
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,280
After everything I did to you,

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,600
let me face my karma myself.

163
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,440
I’m not angry with you at all.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,680
You didn’t know the truth either.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And you were one of the victims too,

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,560
tricked by Professor Mint just like me.

167
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
It wasn’t only Mint who deceived me.

168
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
I deceived myself as well.

169
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
Deep down, I knew

170
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
he was lying.

171
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
He never truly loved me.

172
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
And you didn’t cause me to miscarry.

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,640
I was the foolish one.

174
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,520
I believed what he told me,

175
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
that I was the greatest blessing in his life,

176
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,160
that I was the person

177
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,720
he wanted most to be the mother of his child.

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,360
Professor,

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
he was right.

180
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,560
You are someone’s good fortune,

181
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
someone lucky to have you as a wife

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
or as the mother of their child.

183
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
You’re an incredibly capable person.

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,680
This must be my karma.

185
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,560
But Mint has to face his karma too.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Now he’s completely alone.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
You made me see his true nature.

188
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,800
Thank you so much, Ice.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,480
And I’m truly sorry.

190
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,440
I really am sorry.

191
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,840
Excuse me, nurse.

192
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,360
Yes?

193
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Where did the patient in this room go?

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,640
His family came to take him

195
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,560
home for continued treatment.

196
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Are you Mr. Ice?

197
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes.

198
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,640
Someone left this letter for you.

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
(12 November 2025)

200
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,400
(Mr. Karun Thongdee)

201
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
The personal cash check

202
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,480
I have attached to this letter

203
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,480
is my apology as university president

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,240
And as a request from me as a father,

205
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,320
stop contacting Saint

206
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
before my son is put in even more danger.

207
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,640
From now on,

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,920
you and Saint will no longer meet again.

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,760
Mr.Khom,

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
do you realize what you’re doing?

211
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I know exactly what I’m doing.

212
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
But do you, Bua?

213
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,320
Do you realize what you’re doing?

214
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
Do you remember your duty?

215
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,000
I do.

216
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,600
But what you’re doing now

217
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
is completely irrational.

218
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
How dare you talk back to me?

219
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
Give it to me.

220
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,560
Give it!

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Bua!

222
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Let go!

223
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,800
You’ve completely lost your mind.

224
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,720
I can be even crazier!

225
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
Go.

226
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
Get out.

227
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,560
Fine.

228
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,440
I won’t tolerate this anymore either.

229
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,360
What do you want?

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,000
Why are you here again?

231
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,480
I’m here to see Saint.

232
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,120
Is Saint inside?

233
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,040
He is.

234
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
But you’ll never see him again.

235
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Why?

236
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Did you lock him up?

237
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,560
Like last year?

238
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,880
You want us to break up

239
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,280
so you can be happy, right?

240
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
I’m Saint’s father.

241
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,520
I have the right to choose what’s best for my son.

242
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,400
So you chose the path that makes him unhappy?

243
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,360
Is this what you call love?

244
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Do you love Saint, or do you only love yourself?

245
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
This is my family matter.

246
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Who are you?

247
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,240
You have no right

248
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,440
to interfere.

249
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
But Saint is my family too.

250
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,720
I’ll stand right here.

251
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
I’m not going anywhere

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
until I see Saint.

253
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,440
Hmph.

254
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Do whatever you want!!

255
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr.Khom,

256
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,280
I resign.

257
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Since you’re leaving anyway,

258
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,320
drag him out of my sight as well.

259
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,520
Are you sure you’ll be able to stop them?

260
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,840
What do you mean?

261
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,600
It's been two years.

262
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Saint has never forgetten Ice.

263
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,520
Saint is serious about Ice.

264
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,360
And when teenagers are serious about each other,

265
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,640
they don’t think things through.

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It only makes things spiral even more.

267
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,680
If they think they can go up against me,

268
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,599
they’re mistaken.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
You were young once too, sir.

270
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,200
You should understand them.

271
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,680
Back then, you went against your wife’s family

272
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,359
just like they are now.

273
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,240
Everyone said your relationship wouldn’t last,

274
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,160
but you proved them wrong.

275
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,079
Didn’t you?

276
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,119
Those kids are shallow.

277
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
How would they even understand what real love means?

278
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,720
Ice.

279
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,560
Hello, Pas.

280
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
I’m here.

281
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,960
Okay.

282
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,800
Thank you so much

283
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
for letting me borrow the club’s sound system.

284
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,680
It’s nothing, of course I’d help my junior.

285
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Hang in there, everyone’s cheering you on.

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,400
Thank you.

287
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,600
Okay.

288
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,320
I’ll help.

289
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,280
Good luck.

290
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,600
I’m heading off now.

291
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,200
See you.

292
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,680
See you.

293
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,720
Drive safely.

294
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,480
Hello.

295
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,720
Today, I’m here to look for my missing heart.

296
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,240
There’s an uncle who stole my lover from me.

297
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,880
If you pass by,

298
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,320
please help by liking, commenting,

299
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,000
and sharing to support me.

300
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Someone once said this song is about a secret crush.

301
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,360
Then let it stay a secret.

302
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,520
Let’s see

303
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,000
after this song ends,

304
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,560
how much longer he can keep hiding my love.

305
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,880
(I once went through pain.)

306
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,320
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

307
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,120
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

308
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,480
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

309
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,280
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

310
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,880
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

311
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,800
(And nobody can ever take your place)

312
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,560
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

313
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,040
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

314
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,480
(Thank you for coming into my life)

315
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,120
(as a ray of sunshine,)

316
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,640
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

317
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,400
(from once withered to bloom again.)

318
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,400
(Thank you for making everyday)

319
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,360
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

320
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,600
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

321
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
Mr.Khom?

322
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,400
Mr.Khom?

323
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,280
Hey.

324
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,000
Saint?

325
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,440
Where are you going?

326
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
You're still recovering

327
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,480
I'm going to go see my boyfriend.

328
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,960
But you're my son

329
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,360
and I command you to stay here.

330
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,440
Ice.

331
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,320
You..

332
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,920
Saint..

333
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
Are you hurt?

334
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
I'm going to call the police

335
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,680
on you for breaking and entering!

336
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,840
I'm also going to call the police on you!

337
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,720
The charge is unlawful confinement of

338
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
your own son for many years,

339
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,120
including domestic violence.

340
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
Do you really think

341
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
you can win against me?

342
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,760
Even if I don’t win,

343
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,160
everyone in the university will know

344
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
what kind of father you really are.

345
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,080
Saint.

346
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,320
See that, son?

347
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,240
How could you fall for someone like this?

348
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
He’s destroying our family.

349
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
He is my family.

350
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,480
So you’re choosing him?

351
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,520
Go on.

352
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,360
Choose.

353
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,440
Arrest me, or send him to the police.

354
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Is this really what you want?

355
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,120
This can only end in two ways.

356
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,760
The first choice is

357
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,200
Saint never comes back here again.

358
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,400
The second choice is

359
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,080
Saint and I choose each other.

360
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,040
In the end,

361
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
no matter how it ends,

362
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,960
isn’t Saint the one who will suffer the most?

363
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,360
Isn’t there any other way

364
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,200
for someone as good as Saint

365
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
to be happy like everyone else?

366
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,640
What kind of twisted logic is that?

367
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,720
Bua.

368
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
Go call the police and arrest him.

369
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,760
No, sir.

370
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Your wife’s last request

371
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
was for Saint to never lack love.

372
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Now I finally understand

373
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,400
who truly loves Saint.

374
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
If your wife were still alive,

375
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
she would be disappointed in you,

376
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,400
no less than I am right now.

377
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,840
Fine.

378
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,520
For your mother’s sake,

379
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,760
I’ll give you a chance.

380
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,200
Go wherever you want.

381
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
If you want to be together, then go.

382
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,040
But don’t expect me to help you.

383
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,200
I won’t give you a single baht.

384
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,360
If you think you’re so capable,

385
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,320
if you love each other that much,

386
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
then take responsibility for your own lives.

387
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,480
Dad.

388
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Go!

389
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,320
Leave!

390
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Go now,

391
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,880
before I change my mind!

392
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,400
Go!

393
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,080
Thank you, Dad.

394
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
Are you okay?

395
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,760
I’ve packed all the important things for you already.

396
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
And…

397
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,680
this too.

398
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Here, I’ll help pack.

399
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,120
Are you alright?

400
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,640
Ice,

401
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I’ve already lost one parent.

402
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I don’t want to lose my dad too.

403
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,480
Besides you, he’s the only family I have left.

404
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
Don’t worry.

405
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,160
We’ll figure it out together.

406
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,680
But right now, you need to get treated first.

407
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,840
He’s old.

408
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
I don’t want him to be alone.

409
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,480
Alright.

410
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,600
Thank you for everything, Aunt Bua.

411
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,600
Take care.

412
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
Slowly.

413
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,000
Hey.

414
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,880
Here.

415
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,640
Thank you so much.

416
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,120
If it weren’t for you that day,

417
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,600
I’d probably be dead with my brother by now,

418
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,120
or in prison with Professor Mint.

419
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Now that Professor Mint is gone,

420
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,040
what are you going to do next?

421
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,280
I’ll probably continue studying communication arts.

422
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,520
But finals are in a few days,

423
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,920
and I haven’t attended class at all.

424
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,920
If I pass, I stay.

425
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,160
If I fail, I drop out.

426
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
Hey.

427
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Then take my summary notes.

428
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,560
I guarantee if you read them all,

429
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
you’ll pass.

430
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,640
Damn.

431
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,280
Alright.

432
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,280
And you, stop taking sleeping pills already.

433
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,520
If something’s bothering you,

434
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,760
we’ll take you to heal your heart.

435
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,120
There’s a therapist who’s really good.

436
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,080
You’ll definitely like them.

437
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Hey, is your wound healed yet?

439
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,560
I still can’t put much strain on it.

440
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,520
But it’s going to leave a scar too.

441
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,280
You can’t exert yourself,

442
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,880
but you can drink alcohol, right?

443
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,080
Ahh.

444
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
Hey Alex, mix one for him.

445
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,960
Okay. Mix one for yourself too.

446
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
I’m waiting to clink glasses together.

447
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,320
Alright.

448
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,240
So,

449
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,640
add a lot of cola for me, okay?

450
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,000
I’ll make it for you. Hey,

451
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,080
can you place the order?

452
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,720
Sure.

453
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
Hang on a sec.

454
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,960
Hey,

455
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
about those summary sheets.

456
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,960
Can you let Mud look at them too?

457
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,680
I’ll ask Ten to pass them to him.

458
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,200
Mm.

459
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
Those two again.

460
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,600
I really want to know,

461
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,840
are you still not back together?

462
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,760
With Mud?

463
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,520
Huh?

464
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,480
Why does Mud still have to sleep in my room?

465
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
I’m begging you.

466
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,560
Go make up with him already.

467
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,440
You asshole, do you know?

468
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,560
When he sleeps in my room,

469
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,960
I’m already losing my mind.

470
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,800
The dorm’s tiny,

471
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,920
and before sleeping,

472
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,080
he rambles on about god-knows-what

473
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,400
until three or four in the morning.

474
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
And when he finally sleeps,

475
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,640
he snores.

476
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Damn it.

477
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
I don’t get any sleep at all.

478
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,200
Hey,

479
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,440
just put up with him a bit.

480
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
He’ll grow up eventually.

481
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,320
I had a straight guy mission that

482
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,480
I need to complete too!

483
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,760
You get me, right?

484
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,800
I’m repressed, you get me, right?

485
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Just do it, he won’t say anything.

486
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
Normally when he sleeps with me,

487
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,680
he does it every day anyway.

488
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,120
I’m not shameless like him.

489
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,440
Asshole.

490
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,200
Every time you talk about him, your eyes light up.

491
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
Can you stop lying already?

492
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,560
That you don’t miss him.

493
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,960
Everyone knows already

494
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,360
that you two can’t live without each other.

495
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
If he’s not going to be clear about it,

496
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,760
I think I’d rather cut my losses and just be friends.

497
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
And how clear does he have to be?

498
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,120
You…

499
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
Can’t you try being more open-minded?

500
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
I know I’m childish.

501
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,200
That’s why I stopped.

502
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That’s why I think it’s better to be alone.

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,400
No.

504
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,240
What I mean is,

505
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,880
can you try being more open-minded with yourself?

506
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,480
Not just suddenly saying, I’m childish.

507
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,880
I’m not good.

508
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,640
I should be alone.

509
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,600
I’m better off single.

510
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,200
If you’re in a relationship,

511
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,840
you have to listen,

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
adjust, tune things together, right?

513
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,720
Like guitar strings.

514
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,680
Wow.

515
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
You’re really good at teaching me today.

516
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
You don’t have anyone, do you?

517
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
That’s why you can say all this.

518
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,160
I want my peace of mind back.

519
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,520
Asshole.

520
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,800
Just take him to sleep with you already.

521
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,520
I can’t take this anymore.

522
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
So, aren’t you getting ready today?

523
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,440
I’ve got someone filling in for me today.

524
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,760
I guarantee, when you guys see this,

525
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,200
you’ll be surprised.

526
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,240
Right?

527
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,960
Toon Bodyslam?

528
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
Even bigger than that.

529
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
I wrote a song to make up with my boyfriend.

530
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,600
Where’s your boyfriend, bro?

531
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,520
Hey, let go of me.

532
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
Stop it.

533
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,520
Let go of me.

534
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,280
This is history repeating itself.

535
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,440
Who the hell is this?

536
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
He’s my best friend, bro.

537
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,720
And here,

538
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,920
aren’t your customers going to run out of the shop?

539
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,680
No, they won’t.

540
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
I wrote this song especially for you, Book.

541
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,600
And this song is called

542
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
Booked.

543
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Mud, woo!

544
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,360
Do you still remember?

545
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,200
We were together.

546
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,720
You asked why we even were.

547
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,600
We fought.

548
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,280
Cried and got hurt.

549
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,520
Everyone left.

550
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:15,760
These days I sleep alone, thinking about you.

551
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,920
Can I go back to you?

552
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,040
I want to hold you while we sleep.

553
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,440
After today, don’t flirt with me anymore.

554
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,560
Let everyone know at the same time.

555
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,680
My boyfriend’s name is Book.

556
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Let’s get back together.

557
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Please.

558
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,440
Can you stop being mad at me?

559
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,640
Book,

560
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,680
stop being mad, pleaaase.

561
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
I don't know what else to do so that you'll believe me.

562
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,840
I even posted a status.

563
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
I even messaged everyone I used to talk to.

564
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Even though I got cursed at and called pathetic,

565
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,120
I still did it.

566
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,960
Because I only love you.

567
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,840
I only miss you.

568
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
I only want to sleep holding you.

569
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,400
Can you stop being mad at me?

570
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Book, I’m begging you!

571
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,760
Can we make up?

572
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Come back, please. Stop being mad at me.

573
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,760
Let’s make up,

574
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,600
okay?

575
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah.

576
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,639
I’m sorry too.

577
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,760
I finally see how hard you’ve been trying.

578
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
I’m the one who never tried at all.

579
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,400
I’m sorry.

580
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,320
So what does that mean?

581
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,679
It means you can come sleep with me now.

582
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,880
I miss you.

583
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,480
So...

584
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,560
So you’re agreeing to be my boyfriend again, right?

585
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,280
I never said we broke up.

586
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
I picked this just for you.

587
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,920
Is it pretty?

588
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,360
I really took my time choosing it.

589
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Sit, sit here, quick.

590
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,000
Right this way.

591
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Thank you.

592
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,880
Thank you

593
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
for using my service.

594
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,720
Are you hungry?

595
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,400
I am.

596
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
After fighting for so long,

597
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,000
is this really how it ends?

598
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,240
And are you okay with that?

599
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,560
No, I’m not.

600
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,520
Hold on.

601
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
I'm is still in character.

602
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,560
Let me tune out for a sec.

603
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,640
Okay now?

604
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,200
How was it?

605
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,120
If I had to suggest something...

606
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,680
Hey.

607
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,080
Saint shouldn’t know the ending beforehand.

608
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Let him find out on set.

609
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,640
Like Marvel.

610
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,480
Oh.

611
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
You could’ve just told me nicely.

612
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,680
No need to tear it up.

613
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You scared me to death.

614
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
If I told you first,

615
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
then you’d know in advance.

616
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Do you get what I mean?

617
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,720
Okay, I get it.

618
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,720
Come on, I’ll pack this up for you.

619
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,400
Thank you.

620
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,000
The movie isn’t even finished filming yet.

621
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,160
Saint and Ice’s fans

622
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,600
are already asking about the shooting date.

623
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,360
Ah.

624
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,440
I mean, the release date.

625
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,320
Ugh.

626
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,000
I’m stressed.

627
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,080
Don’t be.

628
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,360
At least you can think of it this way.

629
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,320
Everything that happened

630
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,120
gave your movie free promotion,

631
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,920
not a single baht spent.

632
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,080
That’s true!

633
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Promotion like no other.

634
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,680
Way too dramatic, right?

635
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
A new style?

636
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
Excuse me, serving your food.

637
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,480
Thank you.

638
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,280
It looks delicious.

639
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,480
You look even more delicious.

640
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,840
Nice atmosphere,

641
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,000
beautiful person.

642
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,360
With a sweet mouth like that,

643
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
come here and give me a kiss.

644
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,600
Close your eyes first.

645
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,800
I have a surprise.

646
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,440
Hmm?

647
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,440
I’d like to sing this song for our anniversary.

648
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Happy mensiversary, two months.

649
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,800
(Do you still remember the day we were in love?)

650
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,640
(I remember every second that I had you.)

651
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,560
(I still see you so clearly.)

652
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,400
(All our things are still in the same spot.)

653
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,800
(I now understand who I want in my life.)

654
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,120
(No matter how long, it's still you.)

655
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,960
(Everything that's stuck in my heart,)

656
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,680
(I want to go back in time.)

657
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,480
On every anniversary.

658
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,800
The person standing next to you,

659
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,360
will be me.

660
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,720
Thank you so much, my love.

661
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,960
(Is it still me that you love?)

662
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,160
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

663
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,440
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

664
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,920
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

665
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,080
(can it still be me that you love?)

666
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,480
(I still hold on to every promise,)

667
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,200
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

668
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,520
(Change these cold nights )

669
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,000
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

670
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,280
(That's all I want to ask.)

671
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,160
What are you doing?

672
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,120
Oh.

673
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
You're getting better everyday.

674
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
Don't.

675
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
Spin for me.

676
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
Mud is really bold.

677
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,840
Everyone has their happy ending.

678
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,640
Now it's just us.

679
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,720
What should we do next?

680
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,840
I think that..

681
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,120
I'm pretty happy.

682
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,000
Be real with me.

683
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,800
Do you still miss your dad?

684
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,880
Just hold on a little longer.

685
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,800
I’ll do everything.

686
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,000
So that my dad can't do anything to us anymore.

687
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,360
Even though right now,

688
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
you’re not the billion-baht son-in-law

689
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,280
of Saeng Aruna yet.

690
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
But I’ll make all your dreams

691
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,160
come true.

692
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,520
Yeah.

693
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,600
I promise you

694
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,600
that you'll be proud of me.

695
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,960
I'm already proud of you.

696
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,880
I want the kind of relationship you’re truly proud of.

697
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,800
Not just being comfortable when you’re with me.

698
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,080
I want the whole world to be jealous

699
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,560
that you have me as your boyfriend.

700
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,000
And your dad will have to accept me

701
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,760
as your childhood sweetheart.

702
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,840
From now on,

703
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,360
we still have a lot to prove

704
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,280
before we can go back and face your dad.

705
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,200
So he won’t label me

706
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
as the person who dragged his son away.

707
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
We’ve already been through worse than this.

708
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,880
This doesn’t scare me.

709
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,280
You…

710
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,240
are you ready to be my chaos, fully?

711
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,960
I’ve never been scared anyway, have I?

712
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,000
But…

713
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,120
it’s time to clean up.

714
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
I’m scared the wound will get wet.

715
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,240
Help wipe me down.

716
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,080
Didn’t you say it was healed already?

717
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,720
You don’t want to help?

718
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,080
Please.

719
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,000
Help me wipe down, okay?

720
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
Then I’ll go get a towel first.

721
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Doing it alone is embarrassing.

722
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,520
No.

723
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,480
No.

724
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,440
You don’t have to hold back.

725
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Just do what you want.

726
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,840
The wound might split open.

727
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,440
So what?

728
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,000
It’s fine.

729
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,400
Okay?

730
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Don’t get mad later then.

731
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,000
You have successfully grabbed the doll.

732
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,600
Please open the lid to retrieve the doll.

733
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,000
Where? Is the little bear in here?

734
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,760
I’m seriously asking.

735
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,560
Why do you always get horny in the bathroom?

736
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,280
People are allowed to have weird preferences, right?

737
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,680
So when will you invite Saint’s dad to

738
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,240
have dinner with us?

739
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,720
I just got him kicked out of his house.

740
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,960
If back then

741
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,280
I hadn’t agreed to be your roommate,

742
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,240
Do you think we’d still end up like this today?

743
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,640
Can I take a picture?
