1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,560
Mud, Ice is here!

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,080
Ice.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,320
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,880
I want you to know

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,600
that I'll always be by your side

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,000
As a friend or whatever.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,440
Shall we throw a beach party?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,400
Yes!

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,480
Sorry, it won’t happen again.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,080
Forget it.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
You’re drunk.

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,200
Saint? Ice?

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,040
Have you seen Lanee?

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,120
We’re looking for her too.

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,080
If something happens,

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,440
who’s gonna take responsibility?

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,080
I said let go!

18
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,320
What are you doing to Lanee?!

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Let's break up.

20
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,840
Ice.

21
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,680
I need to be alone.

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,000
(SAINT)

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,000
I know you want to be alone.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
But you've locked yourself away since last night.

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,400
At least...

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
You should come out and have something to eat.

28
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,400
Ice.

29
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
Everyone is worried about you.

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
Do you know that?

31
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
I have something I want to give you.

32
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,120
I know that you're sad

33
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
but...

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,520
I don't want you to think of doing something bad.

35
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
I'm fine.

36
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Ok.

37
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Come out when you're ready.

38
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
Or if you don't want to come out

39
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
because you don't want to see my face

40
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,960
that's fine too.

41
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
So you can come out of your room?

42
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
Huh?

43
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
Sea? Why are you here?

44
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,840
You still have the nerve to ask that?

45
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,960
You’ve been locking yourself in your room for days.

46
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
Of course, people are worried

47
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,200
you might do something bad.

48
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
I thought you quit.

49
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,880
Just smoke when I’m stressed.

50
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,320
It’s my emotional support.

51
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
What’s making you so sad?

52
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
You love Warm that much?

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,960
It’s because I don’t love him

54
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,120
that I’m this hurt.

55
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,480
You know, I feel like absolute shit.

56
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,360
What Warm said was right.

57
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,440
I’m his boyfriend,

58
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,680
but I only ever hang out with Saint.

59
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,280
Whatever I do, I just think about Saint.

60
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,440
I don’t even know what

61
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
Warm likes to do or eat.

62
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,240
I liked him because

63
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,920
he was there for me when I needed someone.

64
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,360
I really am selfish, just like he said.

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah.

66
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,600
He wasn’t wrong about that.

67
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
But don’t forget to step back

68
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,080
and look at the bigger picture.

69
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,360
All this time,

70
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,880
Warm used you too

71
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,560
when you had no one else.

72
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,760
If he didn’t talk about all his positive attributes

73
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,080
you wouldn’t have given in to him that much.

74
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Still,

75
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
I really was in the wrong.

76
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,800
Argh.

77
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Stop.

78
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,760
It’s over, let it be over.

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
Even now,

80
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,000
you’re still letting him mess with your head,

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,560
don’t you see?

82
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,560
You know, people can

83
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
stay and wallow with sadness

84
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,240
but don’t let it be for too long.

85
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,680
Thanks for always being there for me.

86
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
It’s not just me who’s here for you.

87
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,640
There are plenty of people who care about you too.

88
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Don’t overthink it.

89
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,280
I don’t get it.

90
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,960
I think my taste’s pretty good,

91
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,800
how the hell did I end up liking Mud?

92
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,320
That guy acts like

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,800
he’s got just one wrinkle in his brain.

94
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,760
He’s loud, blunt,

95
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,000
doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,840
I swear, I really wanna stop liking him.

97
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
You like Mud?

98
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Then why did you kiss Prite at the party?

99
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Because Mud kissed someone else first.

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I just…

101
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
acted on impulse.

102
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
Yeah, I know, I was an asshole

103
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,800
for doing that out of spite.

104
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,160
But after that day, I realized…

105
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,000
I really liked him.

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,720
So I immediately stopped talking to Prite.

107
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,120
If only Sea were blunt

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,280
then maybe we could actually talk.

109
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh please.

110
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,680
You post statuses with Saint,

111
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,800
then you’re caught kissing Warm a few days later.

112
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
Of course she doesn’t wanna talk to you.

113
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
Ugh, I’m gonna lose my mind.

114
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
Can we not bring that up again?

115
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
I’ve rinsed my mouth like a hundred times already.

116
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
That’s why I’m not drinking today.

117
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
And that cake,

118
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,440
are you really gonna keep it?

119
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah.

120
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
I’m saving it for Sea.

121
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,800
Then why not go talk to her directly?

122
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,560
Sea probably doesn’t wanna talk to me anymore.

123
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,280
But that day,

124
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,560
wasn’t she the one taking care of you?

125
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,760
After that whole fight with Warm?

126
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,480
Yeah, she even helped her into the van.

127
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,560
Wait, really?

128
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Yeah.

129
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,000
I blacked out, I don’t remember a thing.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Then maybe I should try to bump into her.

131
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Hello.

132
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,200
Woo!

133
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,120
Hello everyone!

134
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,360
Welcome to Midnight with Warm Voice!

135
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,800
Woo!

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Tonight, I’m singing this song to win someone back.

137
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
This bastard…

138
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,880
He’s everywhere.

139
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,520
But can I ask everyone here for a favor?

140
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,800
Please take out your phones,

141
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,960
record this performance and post it

142
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,880
on every social media you have.

143
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
Okay!

144
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,560
Make it go viral, okay?

145
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,080
Okay! Okay!

146
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,800
When you’re sad,

147
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
I’m always by your side.

148
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,080
But when you found someone new,

149
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
you left me behind,

150
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,640
all alone.

151
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,520
There’s something I want to say about relationships.

152
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,120
When two people fight,

153
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,760
the one who apologizes first,

154
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
it doesn’t mean they lose.

155
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,360
It means they love the other person more.

156
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,280
Woo!

157
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,160
Right?

158
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,000
RIGHT!

159
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,560
So tonight, I’m singing this song

160
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
to tell that person.

161
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,840
Ice.

162
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,440
Please come back to me.

163
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,960
Woah.

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
Ugh…

165
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
When will you stop bothering Ice already?

166
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,920
You again?

167
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,400
Still can’t stop messing with me, huh?

168
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm trying to win my boyfriend back with a guitar

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,520
and get back what's mine.

170
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,200
Even that guitar belongs to him.

171
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,480
Stop pretending everything’s yours.

172
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,080
What’s your problem?

173
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,840
This guitar, Ice gave it to me.

174
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
You don’t know shit.

175
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Do you even know?

176
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,040
Before your name ever came along,

177
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,600
that flower carved on it was something I drew for him.

178
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,280
Don’t you know how much Ice is sick of you?

179
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,960
So?

180
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
Why?

181
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,480
I’m still gonna win him back.

182
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Hey!

183
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
No filming!

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't!

185
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Stop it!

186
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

187
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,720
Anyone who records, I’ll sue for PDPA violations!

188
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
But he’s a public figure, isn’t he?

189
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,080
Why can’t we film?

190
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Celebrities are still people, sweetie.

191
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,360
Give him some space.

192
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,000
Go on! Film it!

193
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,360
Hello, Ice?

194
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
Something big just happened.

195
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Warm and Saint are about to fight!

196
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,600
What?

197
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Get here fast!

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,280
I gotta hang up.

199
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,360
Then how about this? You and me, one on one, right now.

200
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,920
Clear this up.

201
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,240
If I win,

202
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,600
I get the guitar

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,520
and I’m taking my boyfriend back.

204
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,120
Fine.

205
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,200
But if you lose,

206
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
I take the guitar,

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,240
and...

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,880
you stop stealing credit for Ice’s songs.

209
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,440
Deal.

210
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,520
You think I’m scared of you?

211
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
So what are we dueling with, huh?

212
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,920
Since we’re already at the bar,

213
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
how about a drinking duel?

214
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,280
Saint, don’t be an idiot, man.

215
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,960
You can’t hold your liquor.

216
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
Huh?

217
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
What’s wrong?

218
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
You scared?

219
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,240
Come on, man.

220
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,440
You’re weak.

221
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
I’ll handle it. Fine.

222
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,880
I’m in.

223
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,640
Miss Aor?

224
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,520
Could you close the shop for us first?

225
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
Don’t worry about the cost,

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll will take care of it.

227
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,280
Please?

228
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,560
Pretty please?

229
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,560
We’re all friends here.

230
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Alright, I’ll handle it for you.

231
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,400
Sure. Okay, thanks.

232
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,200
Sure thing.

233
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Everyone!

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
The shop’s closed now!

235
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,000
Closed! Huh?

236
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Wow, what’s going on? No worries.

237
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,240
The first round of the Golden Throat Challenge begins!

238
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,240
If you’re ready…

239
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Three!

240
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,040
Two!

241
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,720
One!

242
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
Go!

243
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,280
Here we go.

244
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
One down!

245
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,360
Take it easy, or you’ll get knocked out.

246
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,040
Maybe give up now, huh?

247
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
If someone’s not meant for you,

248
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,120
nothing you do will make it work.

249
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,360
What did he just say?

250
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,840
Everything he's saying is so about him.

251
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,160
Second round!

252
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
This one’s called

253
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Breaking the Elephant’s Tusk

254
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,680
This round’s intense.

255
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
You better watch yourself.

256
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,760
If you’re ready…

257
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,520
Three!

258
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,040
Two!

259
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,520
One!

260
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,440
Go!

261
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
You’re so weak,

262
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,240
go home and drink milk.

263
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,480
The third round is called

264
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,520
The Naga’s Demon Hunt

265
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,840
If you can handle it, go on!

266
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,680
Three!

267
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,160
Two!

268
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,720
One!

269
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,760
Go!

270
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
Woo!

271
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
Still holding up,

272
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,760
huh?

273
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,040
You can quit anytime, you know.

274
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,520
You good, man?

275
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Hey?

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,040
He’s still drinking?

277
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,520
I can’t even think of a name for the next set.

278
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,119
What do we do now?

279
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,920
You sure you’re good?

280
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh..

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Guess not.

282
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh my god.

283
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Okay.

284
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
Alright, alright!

285
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,000
The winner is…

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Saint!

287
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,920
Fabulous.

288
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,920
Tch.

289
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Pathetic!

290
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
You really think after all this…

291
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
he’s gonna accept you?

292
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Do as you promised.

293
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
Promised what?

294
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,280
Where’s your proof?

295
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,440
When did I ever make a deal with you?

296
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Where’s the evidence?

297
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,320
Where’s the promise?

298
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,040
If you’ve got nothing, it’s invalid.

299
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,880
Huh?

300
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,760
Hey! Give it back!

301
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Warm!

302
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Ice?

303
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,240
Ice, how did you get here?

304
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,560
You came to see me?

305
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,240
Come on.

306
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
Let’s go back to our condo.

307
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,640
Oh my god!

308
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,000
The things you gave me…

309
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,520
I’m returning them.

310
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,040
From now on,

311
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,080
we have nothing to do with each other.

312
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

313
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
I’m not taking them back!

314
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,600
No.

315
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,640
We’re done.

316
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,560
You’re so damn annoying.

317
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,880
Why do you love each other so much?

318
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,640
Ah! Hey!

319
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,160
Hey!

320
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,240
Ice?

321
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,000
Did you just hit me?

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Can’t you see how much I love you?

323
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
I even went public with us for you!

324
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,800
Enough.

325
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
You did all that because you knew

326
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,440
that you had no one else left.

327
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,680
Ice.

328
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,080
Ice!

329
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
Stop right there.

330
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,920
If you take one more step,

331
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
I swear I won’t let you off.

332
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,120
I’ll take it from here.

333
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,920
Take care of Saint, okay?

334
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,400
He’s never had this much to drink before.

335
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,120
I’m not sure what’ll happen.

336
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah, I’ll handle it.

337
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Ice!

338
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Ice!

339
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,400
Hey! Hey?

340
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
Ice!

341
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,760
Hey!

342
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Walk carefully.

343
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
We’re almost there.

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,000
Uncle!

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,680
Hey, salmon!

346
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,520
What salmon? These are just fish balls.

347
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,800
Uncle! Salmon!

348
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,160
Uncle, stop!

349
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,520
Don’t eat yet!

350
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,840
Are you selling them or eating them yourself?

351
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
Saint!

352
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
Don’t, uncle.

353
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,480
Put it down.

354
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,160
Let’s talk.

355
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,800
Just for a minute.

356
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,560
I want salmon.

357
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
I want salmon!

358
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
I want that salmon!

359
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
Please.

360
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
I’m a bear, so I gotta eat salmon, right?

361
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,480
Right?

362
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,680
Can I buy it from you?

363
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,360
Alright, 200 baht.

364
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Two hundred?!

365
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Let him have it.

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,960
Come on.

367
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,800
Here.

368
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,520
Here.

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,320
Thank you.

370
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
Let’s go.

371
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Fish balls are fine, I guess.

372
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Here, I’ll do it for you.

373
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,960
Just sit still.

374
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,480
Want sauce?

375
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,040
Of course, who eats without sauce?

376
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,840
Here, eat up, bear.

377
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,520
Good?

378
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Hey.

379
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
Saint!

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,520
Salmon!

381
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
Are you okay?

382
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,880
Mmm.

383
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,800
Sit down, sit down.

384
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,760
You okay?

385
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,160
Need help with anything?

386
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,720
Saint?

387
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,200
You still with me?

388
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
Play guitar for me.

389
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,640
Huh?

390
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,920
Play guitar for me.

391
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,480
I wanna hear you play.

392
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
What song?

393
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
A lullaby maybe?

394
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,480
Suits your state right now.

395
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
No.

396
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,240
Play our song.

397
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,800
Ours.

398
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,880
Sure.

399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,880
(Thank you for coming into my life)

400
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
(as a ray of sunshine,)

401
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,960
(from once withered to bloom again.)

403
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,640
(Thank you for making everyday)

404
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,880
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

405
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,120
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

406
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,240
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

407
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,720
That's great.

408
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,840
Ice.

409
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,880
Hmm?

410
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
I have something to tell you.

411
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,560
Actually, my dad forced Lanee and me

412
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,040
to be in a fake relationship

413
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,640
and pretend to love each other.

414
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
So that we could have our own lives.

415
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,200
So that’s why you two had to kiss on the cheeks?

416
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
Whatever.

417
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
But you and Lanee…

418
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
you look good together.

419
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
But I don’t like Lanee.

420
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,520
There’s someone else I like.

421
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,880
Who?

422
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,640
Can you tell me?

423
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Not now.

424
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Then why make me curious?

425
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,440
One day,

426
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,040
I’ll tell you myself.

427
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,280
Saint, are you awake yet?

428
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
Saint.

429
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,280
Saint.

430
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,920
Wake up.

431
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,400
Here.

432
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,120
Thanks.

433
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,600
Hey…

434
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
you’re still being a bear, huh?

435
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,320
I want salmon.

436
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,480
Want salmon.

437
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,560
Want salmon.

438
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,280
Want salmon.

439
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,000
Want salmon.

440
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Were you possessed by a grizzly or something?

441
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,080
If I’m a grizzly bear,

442
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,600
then you’re…

443
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,880
a panda bear.

444
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,000
What?

445
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Here.

446
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,000
Delete it.

447
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,960
You delete my photo first.

448
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,240
Saint,

449
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,280
I’m serious.

450
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,160
Just delete it.

451
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,360
Hey, I’m sorry.

452
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
I didn’t mean to make you feel bad.

453
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,000
I deleted it.

454
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,040
Thanks for getting my guitar back.

455
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,600
But don’t drink that much again.

456
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
You could die, you know.

457
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,320
If it wasn’t you,

458
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,120
I wouldn’t have drank that much.

459
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,240
Am I that important?

460
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,400
You still kept it?

461
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I've never thought of throwing it away.

462
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,400
So it was your dad who broke it last time.

463
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,880
Then I’ll fix it this time.

464
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
And I got this for you, too.

465
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
I saw it and thought it was cute,

466
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,200
so I bought it for you.

467
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,000
Cute, right?

468
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,680
Just like you.

469
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
There, it’s on.

470
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,520
See? Told you I could fix it.

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Pretty good, huh?

472
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yeah.

473
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Now it’s just like before.

474
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,280
I’m glad the sunflower I drew is still there.

475
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
It’s always been there.

476
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,080
So…

477
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,200
if you don’t marry Lanee,

478
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,720
what will you do?

479
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
I don’t know.

480
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,000
But...

481
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,960
I think it’s time.

482
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I need to live my own life.

483
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,800
I just want to be an ordinary person

484
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
who gets to be with someone I like.

485
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,800
The bear is tilted.

486
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
You guys are here early.

487
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,960
How long are you going to avoid me?

488
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,760
Sea.

489
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,320
I have nothing to say to you.

490
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,960
Didn’t I already say

491
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
we should only talk about work?

492
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,360
Talking more and understanding each other

493
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,840
is part of working together, isn’t it?

494
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
You always tell actors to talk things out.

495
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,280
So why can’t the director do it too?

496
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,640
I only have three things to say to you.

497
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Just listen till the end.

498
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,480
Whether you believe me

499
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,520
or not afterward is up to you.

500
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,680
First, Saint and I don’t love each other like that.

501
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
No matter what, we’ll never get married.

502
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,080
Second…

503
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,120
I already like someone else.

504
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,760
And the person I like is you.

505
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,680
I’ve liked you since the first day I saw you,

506
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,560
since the moment we passed each other on campus.

507
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,040
I really liked you, and that feeling keeps growing.

508
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,320
This is the cake I cut just for you from my birthday.

509
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,560
Say the third thing,

510
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,640
so I can get back to work.

511
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,760
Okay.

512
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,480
Can you please stay around a little longer to be

513
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,960
the reason and encourage me to face my mom?

514
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Because if you’re not by my side,

515
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,640
I don’t even know why I’d keep trying.

516
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Aren’t you going to say something?

517
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,320
If you act cold toward me even a little,

518
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,760
I’ll start crying.

519
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,680
It’s probably spoiled by now.

520
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,920
You shouldn’t have kept it that long.

521
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,760
I just wanted you to know…

522
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,880
that everything I’ve done,

523
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,000
I always did with you in mind.

524
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,840
And I never wanted to talk to you just for fun.

525
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,120
Are you still mad at me?

526
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Okay.

527
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,520
Then can I add a fourth thing?

528
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,000
I never wanted to kiss Warm.

529
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,400
Do you know why?

530
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,800
Because the only person I’ve ever wanted to kiss

531
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
is you.

532
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,880
Actually..

533
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I stopped being mad at you after the second thing.

534
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,360
Really?

535
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,679
Yeah.

536
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,320
Then why didn’t you say so back then?

537
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,120
Why wait until I got to the fourth thing?

538
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,760
Because I wanted to tell you back

539
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
that the only person I want to kiss...

540
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
is you too.

541
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Let me see, are you crying?

542
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,000
Still beautiful.

543
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,320
Not anymore.

544
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,720
You are.

545
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,920
Welcome to our new member

546
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
joining as part of the friends’ group!

547
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Thank you.

548
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Today’s activity is about imagination.

549
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,520
We’ll start by imagining simple, everyday things

550
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,400
and then move to things farther away.

551
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,760
Alright, let’s begin.

552
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,120
Imagine that

553
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,680
you feel hot.

554
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
Three.

555
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,480
Two.

556
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,440
One.

557
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,520
Action.

558
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
It’s hot! So hot!

559
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,320
Ugh, it’s boiling!

560
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,640
I can’t take it anymore!

561
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,880
Oh!

562
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,600
It's so hot!

563
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,240
I can’t take it anymore!

564
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,800
It’s so hot I’m sweating everywhere!

565
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
I can’t do this anymore!

566
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,120
Ok.

567
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,320
And the person who acted the most realistically

568
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,120
was…

569
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Ten!

570
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
You’re confused, right?

571
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,200
Well, when people feel hot,

572
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,040
sometimes they just stand still.

573
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Holy shit, that was amazing!

574
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,920
How did you do that, Ten?

575
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,640
Alright.

576
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,080
Now let’s try imagining something farther from reality.

577
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,480
Let’s imagine that

578
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,800
the person in front of you

579
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,640
is your boyfriend or girlfriend.

580
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,360
Uh…

581
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
We’re not even in pairs.

582
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,040
Then you can play with Book.

583
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,680
I’ll sacrifice myself. Huh?

584
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,520
I'm so good now.

585
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
Wow.

586
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,400
Ok.

587
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,360
Come on.

588
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,280
Imagine that the

589
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
person sitting across from you is your lover.

590
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,720
How would you act, look,

591
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,600
and what would the conversation be like?

592
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,680
Try.

593
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
Hey.

594
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,960
What are you doing?

595
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
I miss you.

596
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
What kind of mood are you in?

597
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,360
I just miss you.

598
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,800
Do I need a reason to?

599
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,880
Why are you being so clingy,

600
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
little bear?

601
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,200
Because I don’t want my big bear to disappear again.

602
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Are they seriously rehearsing?

603
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,440
Why do I feel something heavy in the air?

604
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,320
Right?

605
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,120
They are more than friends for sure.

606
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah.

607
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,360
Alright, let me try.

608
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Wanna go on a date?

609
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,280
Hey, no, that’s not it!

610
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,400
Uh…

611
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,120
I think that’s too stiff.

612
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,240
It should be like…

613
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,200
Wanna go on a date, babe?

614
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,000
Why are you being so polite?

615
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,800
Lovers don’t talk like that!

616
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,080
Okay, cut!

617
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,040
Mud,

618
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,240
what happened there?

619
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,840
I just didn’t feel it.

620
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Didn’t feel it?

621
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
Yeah, I just can’t imagine myself

622
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,280
being Book’s boyfriend.

623
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,480
That’s why it’s called imagination.

624
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,360
Maybe you should just act natural.

625
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,680
Like, don’t overdo it.

626
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,840
Sometimes being your normal self

627
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,720
would be like an actual lover.

628
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,320
No.

629
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,560
If I imagine that, it just feels…

630
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,560
ridiculous.

631
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
If it’s that funny to play with me,

632
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,560
then play with Ten instead.

633
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,200
What’s wrong with you?

634
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,880
Ugh.

635
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,360
Can we even finish this scene?

636
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
My head hurts.

637
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Oh,

638
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,680
by the way about Warm taking credits for your songs?

639
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
I already leaked the story.

640
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,640
(#TraineeWarmDrama: career dead before debut)

641
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,720
(Evidence shows he stole his ex’s song credit)

642
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,920
(Netizens reveal he also cheated)

643
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,800
(Netizen 2: Saw him flirting with girls at clubs,

644
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,520
(so messy!)

645
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,120
(So he had another girlfriend? I’m confused.)

646
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,200
(Netizen 3: I waited for his debut, so disappointed.

647
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,600
Hey, did we go too far?

648
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,560
He wasn’t fired just for stealing a song, right?

649
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,120
Like Book said,

650
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,040
Warm screwed himself over with his own behavior.

651
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,920
You better not blame yourself.

652
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Yeah.

653
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,720
Ugh, but Wednesday’s unlucky.

654
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,080
Saturday’s the best day to start new things

655
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,760
and Sunday’s the most vibrant.

656
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,120
Everything will go smoothly.

657
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,880
Ha!

658
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,080
Whether it goes smoothly or not depends on who?

659
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,240
On me!

660
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,920
Besides,

661
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,800
shooting on holidays is a nightmare

662
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,760
because there's too many people.

663
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,480
You know that, right?

664
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,880
And you’re still worried about lucky timing?

665
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,360
Well, if it rains or something happens,

666
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,720
don’t blame me!

667
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,200
Ugh.

668
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,160
Ah!

669
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,840
Why are you two arguing over the dumbest stuff?

670
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,400
And you too.

671
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,320
What? How’s this my fault?

672
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,280
Don’t say fortune-telling is silly!

673
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,400
Then why don’t you

674
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,080
make a fortune-telling content video, Cookie?

675
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,880
That way, we can use it to promote the show.

676
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,960
Good idea!

677
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,720
Finally, I can prove my skills at work!

678
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,640
Hello everyone,

679
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,560
welcome to our new Midnight Noon segment!

680
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,600
I’m Cookie, the resident fortune-teller.

681
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,320
accurate and honest, no lies!

682
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Our first guest today!

683
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,880
Tada ~ Saint!

684
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,680
Hi.

685
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,840
What do you want me to read for you today?

686
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,240
Work, I guess.

687
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,800
Boring! No!

688
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
Let's do love instead!

689
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Pick one card.

690
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,440
Here. Alright.

691
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
The Sun.

692
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,560
This means

693
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,000
your love life is about to shine!

694
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,240
A relationship is developing beautifully.

695
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,680
If you’re single and go for someone,

696
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,280
they’ll start to notice your good qualities.

697
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Come on, Ice.

698
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,520
Pick a card.

699
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,240
Don’t be scared.

700
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,000
This one?

701
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,360
The Fool, the liar.

702
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
This card says that

703
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,920
the one you love might be hiding a secret.

704
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,880
If they like someone else,

705
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,480
they’ll still act like they like you too,

706
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,040
making you confused and uncertain.

707
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,920
But hey,

708
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
destiny only decides 20%.

709
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,440
The rest is up to us.

710
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,680
That’s it for today, Cookie’s signing off!

711
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Bye-bye!

712
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,880
Hey, you can head back first.

713
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,200
Pas asked Lanee and me

714
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,960
to help with the songwriting contest.

715
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh?

716
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,920
When will you be back?

717
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,720
Probably late.

718
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,200
Okay.

719
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,920
I have something to tell you.

720
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,760
Come here.

721
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,120
I have a crush.

722
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,880
Huh?

723
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,000
I mean,

724
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,360
that’s the theme of the contest “love and crushes.”

725
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm all done.

726
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,520
That’s all I’ll spoil for now, see you later.

727
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,000
Nice.

728
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,280
Take care, Ice.

729
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,240
Bye.

730
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,640
That was awesome.

731
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Alright, this is the last team’s performance.

732
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
So what are you going to do about Ice?

733
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,360
Are you going to just be with him?

734
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,560
Or...

735
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,320
should we both just hold our partners’ hands and say

736
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,080
there’s no way we’re getting married?

737
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,520
If it were that easy,

738
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,000
I would’ve done it a long time ago.

739
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,880
I wouldn’t have let things end the way

740
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,400
they did in high school.

741
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,840
If I go public with him now,

742
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,400
my dad will just do everything

743
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,200
to make Ice disappear from my life anyway.

744
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,080
So you’re just gonna let it stay this way forever?

745
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,680
No.

746
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
As soon as I can deal with my dad,

747
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,400
I’ll tell Ice the whole truth.

748
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,800
I just…

749
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,440
don’t want anyone to hurt him again.

750
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,800
Hello?

751
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,720
Warm.

752
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,120
I told you, if you’re still around,

753
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,000
my company is going to take a hit.

754
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,080
This news is huge, you know that?

755
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,200
No.

756
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,960
Please, I just want...

757
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,120
I told you to be careful!

758
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,360
You never listen!

759
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,840
Hey.

760
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,440
Hey.

761
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,120
Shit.

762
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,720
Tina.

763
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,360
Tina!

764
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,400
Hello?

765
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,600
Tina, where are you?

766
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,400
Hey!

767
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
Stop calling me already.

768
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
You copied a song and you still dare to call me?

769
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,160
Tina.

770
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,560
Tina, listen to me!

771
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,480
Tina!

772
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,000
Shit.

773
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,200
Damn it.

774
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,920
Ice.

775
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,240
Sorry, the number you are trying to reach

776
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,200
cannot be contacted at the moment.

777
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Ice.

778
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,160
Sorry, the number you are trying to reach

779
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,440
cannot be contacted at the moment.

780
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,360
Fuck.

781
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,960
You’re selfish too, Ice.

782
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,520
Hey.

783
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,440
What are you doing here?

784
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I came to see my boyfriend, of course.

785
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,520
I missed you, can’t I come see you?

786
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,760
I told you that day already.

787
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
We broke up.

788
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,280
Wait.

789
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,640
Let’s talk.

790
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,240
I have nothing left to say to you.

791
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,240
Okay, okay.

792
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,400
I’ll get straight to it.

793
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,880
I just realized that

794
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,400
you never gave me something.

795
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,640
What?

796
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,640
I already returned everything you gave me.

797
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
My headphones.

798
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
Even though we broke up,

799
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,480
I still want to..

800
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,760
You don’t have to say anything, I’ll go get them.

801
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,280
Do you want anything else?

802
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,360
We’ve got grilled pork skewers too. No.

803
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,240
What would you like?

804
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Hold on a sec. Sure, take your time.

805
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,880
(Saint: Have you eaten yet?)

806
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,040
(Saint: Want anything? I’ll bring something up.)

807
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,440
Um…

808
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,360
How much for the grilled pork?

809
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,960
Ten baht per skewer.

810
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,480
I’ll take ten skewers.

811
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,160
Would you like sticky rice too?

812
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,880
Two packs, please. Sure.

813
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,840
Sure.

814
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,480
(Saint: Have you eaten yet?)

815
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,600
(Saint: Want anything? I’ll bring something up.)

816
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,600
One hundred twenty baht.

817
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,040
Here you go, thank you.

818
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Thanks.

819
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,720
Hey!

820
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,680
What the hell are you doing?!

821
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,720
What, I can’t?

822
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,560
You asshole!

823
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,920
What the hell are you doing?!

824
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,680
Take it!

825
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,960
I think I told you wrong earlier.

826
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,520
I don’t want my headphones anymore.

827
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,720
Then what do you want?

828
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,200
Huh?

829
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,800
Hey!

830
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,040
Stay still.

831
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,960
Warm!

832
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,200
You bastard!

833
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,840
You son of a bitch!

834
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,760
Good.

835
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,040
My whole life, I’ve never gotten anything before Saint.

836
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,760
So now I’ll fuck you before Saint does.

837
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,200
And I’ll record it too,

838
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,680
in case anyone wants to see

839
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,960
a washed-up ex-porn star

840
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,080
fucking a failed trainee like me.

841
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,080
Shit.

842
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,760
I’ve been waiting for this for so long, Ice.

843
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,560
You piece of shit.

844
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,680
This drug will make you beg me for it.

845
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
Come on, moan for me.

846
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,120
Moan out loud!

847
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,200
You fucker!

848
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,720
You bastard! Hey, Ice!

849
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,200
Ice! Shit!

850
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,520
You fucker!

851
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,000
Got drugged yourself, huh?

852
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,160
How does it feel?

853
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,360
Good?

854
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,680
(Saint)

855
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,560
Saint!

856
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,000
Hello, Ice?

857
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,640
Saint!

858
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,920
Ice.

859
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,760
Saint!

860
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,400
Hello, Ice!

861
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,800
(Saint)

862
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,840
Saint.

863
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,760
Ice.

864
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,680
Saint, help me.

865
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,440
Ice? Hello?

866
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,560
Saint, help me.

867
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,360
Saint.

868
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,960
Saint.

869
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,840
Saint.

870
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,040
No one’s coming to save you.

871
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,280
Saint.

872
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,720
Saint.

873
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,360
Warm!!

874
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,640
What the hell are you doing?!

875
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,200
Ice!

876
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,920
Saint!

877
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,040
Saint!

878
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,840
Saint!

879
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,760
Saint!

880
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Calm down, man.

881
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,720
Saint.

882
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,280
Let me go.

883
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,000
I didn’t do anything wrong.

884
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,280
Take him away.

885
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,680
Can this be used as evidence?

886
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,640
Let me take a look.

887
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,520
From the initial investigation,

888
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,600
the suspect overdosed on drugs and mixed it with alcohol.

889
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,320
Please take care of it.

890
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,400
Yes, sir.

891
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
I’ll proceed with the case.

892
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,240
Excuse me. Goodbye.

893
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,720
Ice.

894
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,360
Ice.

895
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,920
Meena.

896
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,880
Yes, Saint?

897
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,440
I think we should take Ice to the hospital right away.

898
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,080
Okay, I’ll go get a car.

899
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Ice, are you okay, dear?

900
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,320
Saint, please look after him.

901
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,040
Drink some water.

902
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,960
Are you feeling better?

903
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,400
Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.

904
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,880
Can we not go?

905
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,720
No.

906
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Get up.

907
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,360
Saint, kiss me.

908
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,360
No.

909
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,840
Saint.

910
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,160
Just once, please, kiss me.

911
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,560
Come on, I’ll take you to the hospital.

912
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,040
Ugh, why’s there so much traffic?

913
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,720
And that car? Why don’t they just turn?

914
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,640
Use the signal, ugh!

915
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,520
We're in a hurry here!

916
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,640
How’s he doing?

917
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,480
Is Ice okay?

918
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,920
I really don’t know.

919
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,200
From now on, I promise, I won’t be careless again.

920
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,360
I won’t let strangers enter the building easily ever again.

921
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,000
I’m truly sorry.

922
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,200
Ice,

923
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,000
I’m sorry.

924
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,160
Take it slow.

925
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,720
Drink some water first.

926
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,600
Are you feeling a bit better now?

927
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,120
Yeah.

928
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,320
Just a little dizzy, that’s all.

929
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,480
But I’m okay otherwise.

930
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,920
Aren’t you going to change clothes?

931
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,080
No.

932
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,120
I wanted to stay until you woke up.

933
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,720
I never thought

934
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
Warm would do something like that to me.

935
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,520
Because he’s a bastard.

936
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,000
But don’t worry, the cops already arrested him.

937
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,320
After this, your karma with him is done.

938
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,200
I’m sorry

939
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,480
for letting you go through something dangerous again.

940
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
It’s okay.

941
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,080
It’s not your fault.

942
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,600
Even though I said I wanted to protect you,

943
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,760
in the end, I was never in time.

944
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,720
How could anyone have known this would happen?

945
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,360
If you had known beforehand,

946
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,240
would you have let me be in danger like that?

947
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,120
About last night, being drugged and all

948
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,280
if it weren’t for you,

949
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,360
things could’ve been so much worse.

950
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,240
Thank you so much.

951
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,400
Even though I like protecting you,

952
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,160
I still want you to only go through good things.

953
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,600
Yeah.

954
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,880
Or maybe Saint and Book like each other.

955
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
Wait.. do you like Book?

956
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,200
Why am I annoyed?

957
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
They’re even wearing matching shirts.

958
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,480
Oh?!

959
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,200
I’m mad now.

960
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,400
Happy now?

961
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,080
Wait, are you jealous?
