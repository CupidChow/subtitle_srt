00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,360
Hello, my name is Ice.

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,400
If you wanna get horny, subscribe now.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,640
And come see for yourself.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,520
This is the guy I told you about

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,040
the sophomore who dropped out.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
So hot!

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,720
Back then, his leaked pics were everywhere online

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
The gays were all over him, getting off like crazy.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,640
He even had drama with a professor from our uni.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,000
He accused the professor of doing it.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,440
Are you serious?

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,160
But actually, he was hitting on the professor

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,760
even though the guy already had a wife and kid.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,240
And when the professor wouldn’t play along

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,480
he threw a huge tantrum.

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
I don’t know.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,080
but it ended with the professor’s wife

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,960
having a miscarriage.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,480
and he got banned, so he dropped out.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,480
Next thing we knew, he was a porn star.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,560
But I heard he’s coming back to study in our year.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,039
I think whatever he films, that’s his own right.

23
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,160
But making false accusations

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,039
against the professor

25
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,640
that was way too much.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
Why would he even come back to study again?

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
Right?Right?

28
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,840
There he is!

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Where? That one.

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
He’s hot though. Oh my god!

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,840
So hot!

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,960
Is it still me that you love?

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,560
I still hold on to every promise

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,360
and my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,680
Change these cold nights

36
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,160
and bring us back to where we belong.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,840
That's all I want to ask.

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
An Unwelcome Return

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,920
Big entrance, huh?

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,160
First day and you’re already famous

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,680
so fitting for Ice.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Was it you who did the photos?

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,160
What?

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Must’ve been rough, huh?

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,079
Printing out so many of them.

46
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,480
You must’ve watched all the porn films

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,000
I starred in, right?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Which one’s your favorite?

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,480
Hell no, who’d want to watch porn with you in it

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,840
I’m asking you seriously?

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,720
Do you even realize

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,840
how much trouble your comeback

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,800
has caused other people?

54
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Especially Saint, my friend.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,000
Show some shame, will you?

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you mean?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,480
Professor Sara specifically assigned Saint

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,600
to monitor your behavior

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,360
since he’s the class president.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,920
I never asked for that.

61
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,440
This asshole’s just provoking me.

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
What do you want, huh?

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Huh?

64
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Stop!

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
This is a university.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
If you want to fight, do it somewhere else.

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,440
Tell your friend.

68
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
I was minding my own business.

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,440
It was your friends that picked a fight with me.

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,680
Move.

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,520
Picked a fight?

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,080
You were the one provoking me first.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Damn it.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Hey! Stop filming right now.

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,000
If you don’t

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
I’ll report you all for violating the PDPA law.

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
You don’t need to worry your friend

78
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
will get in trouble

79
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,360
I’ve been bullied by the whole faculty

80
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,640
and he still couldn’t do anything

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
You don’t need to look after me.

82
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
I’ll tell the professor myself

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,360
so we don’t have to keep running

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,240
into each other

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Alright?

86
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,200
Wait, you two planned this just to mess with Ice?

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
No, man.

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,280
We didn’t know anything.

89
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,000
We were just reminding him, that’s all.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,760
Don’t you remember

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,120
what he did to Professor Mint last year?

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,720
But that still

93
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,880
doesn’t give you the right to do this to anyone.

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,720
Shit, here comes the professor.

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Where are you all trying to run off to?

96
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
And what’s going on here?

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Clear this up right now.

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,560
Help clean up the floor, everything, now.

99
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,640
Hurry, pick it all up.

100
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Don’t just stare, clean it up, all of it.

101
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,440
What a mess, are you really okay?

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,840
Are you sure you don’t want

103
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,960
to step in and resolve this?

104
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,200
But that won’t do.

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,640
Either way

107
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,159
I need to deal with whoever did this to you.

108
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,200
Professor, can you not assign

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,480
Saint to monitor me?

110
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,440
No, yours is a special case.

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,480
The committee made it clear,

112
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,200
a sophomore with good grades and maturity

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
must supervise and

114
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,000
be responsible for your conduct.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Then can I pick someone else?

116
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
Besides Saint

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,200
do you even know anyone else in your class

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,240
or anyone who volunteered?

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,080
Oh, sorry.

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
I didn’t mean it like that.

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,480
I just meant Saint’s the right choice.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,960
He meets all the requirements, class president

124
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
good behavior, and excellent grades.

125
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,000
And I heard you two knew each other

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,440
even before university

127
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,520
With Saint watching over you

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,400
things should be easier, right?

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,040
Yes.

130
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
Thank you, professor.

131
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,560
I hope this semester will be a fresh start for you.

132
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,159
Good luck.

133
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
From the latest draft of my script

134
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
the story takes place in 1997

135
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Kit lives with his biological mother Choon

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,440
and Sin

137
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,120
his stepbrother brought along by his stepfather

138
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,240
Kit and Sin’s love blossoms amidst hardship.

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,080
The main message we want to convey is love

140
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
in the shadows within a repressive society.

141
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,600
Not bad, the storyline and message are complete.

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,240
But as I’ve mentioned before,

143
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,800
for student projects seeking

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,640
sponsorship from our company

145
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,560
a script alone isn’t enough

146
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,039
it has to align with our CSR.

147
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,799
Actually, my story touches on stigma reduction

148
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,559
and gives a voice to people at risk of suicide.

149
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,120
But every story has a message already.

150
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
If it’s just the script

151
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,520
then I’m afraid we’ll have to pass.

152
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Wait a moment.

153
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,000
The casting is interesting.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,200
The actor playing Sin, is it Ice

155
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
the former porn star with leaked videos?

156
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,480
Those clips, Ice was forced to film them.

157
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
I understand

158
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,240
I just personally want to give him a chance too.

159
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Our company values people

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
even those with troubled

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,760
pasts or who’ve been victims before

162
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,440
Everyone deserves a chance tofollow their dreams

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,240
and become actors too

164
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
As for CSR,

165
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,920
we can work on that later.

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,560
And the other lead actor, still not casted yet?

167
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,800
Give me two weeks, please.

168
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
I’ll find someone.

169
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Can’t you do it sooner?

170
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,280
We want to submit the film to the

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Youth Film Competition this year

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
And you’ll start shooting in two months, right?

173
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,520
Do you really think you have that much time?

174
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Please secure the lead by this Friday.

175
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Otherwise, we’ll have to give the opportunity

176
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,280
to another project that’s more ready.

177
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
No problem.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,760
Hey.

179
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
How’d the pitch go?

180
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,520
Before that, tell me?

181
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Who was that punk?

182
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Mud, from my year, before I dropped out.

183
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,440
Where is he? I’ll take care of him.

184
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Wait, calm down.

185
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
I can handle it myself.

186
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,240
Just didn’t expect things to blow up

187
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,400
so hard on the first day.

188
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,480
And you’ve already got work stress

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,360
don’t add this on.

190
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,240
Anyway, Midnight Sunday passed the pitch.

191
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,040
I cast you as Sin, the lead.

192
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,360
But do they know about my past?

193
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,000
They do and they liked it.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,040
The only thing left is casting the other male lead

195
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,840
and we have to lock that in by Friday.

196
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,880
So Ice, you need to help me with the casting tape.

197
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
But can I get through the next two days first?

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,480
I’m busy sorting out the dorm.

199
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,040
Got a room already?

200
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,880
Yeah.

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,120
It’s awesome.

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Wow.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
14,000 baht a month

204
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
split in half, that’s 7,000 each.

205
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,560
But at least it saves a lot on travel costs.

206
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
Looks good though.

207
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,360
So who’s your roommate?

208
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
I don’t even know yet.

209
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,280
The agent arranged it for me.

210
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,800
But I did give them a full list of conditions.

211
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
I’m still confused

212
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,400
how a good roommateended up with me.

213
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,880
You’re really lucky, man.

214
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,440
Just let me have one good thing, please.

215
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
I want some things to go right.

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
Well, you already got a good room.

217
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
As for the roommate

218
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,080
you’ll see if he’s good or not.

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,760
Amen.

220
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Don’t pray to me.

221
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,080
I’m praying for a good roommate.

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,880
(First day of the semester and here he is! )

223
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,800
("Hot upperclassman alert” with that top-tier aura)

224
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,000
(he should just be a star already.)

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,480
(That's him? The young stock market prodigy)

226
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,760
(heir to the real estate empire, “Saengarunwong.”)

227
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,520
Excuse me?

228
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,720
Yes?

229
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,160
I’m Ice, here to check in for the dorm.

230
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
Aren’t Jack and Joke getting together anymore?

231
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,640
I’m still pissed they sent Noo Lek to the dumpster.

232
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,840
She was such a good actor.

233
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,120
Excuse me.

234
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,640
Excuse me.

235
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,680
Excuse me!

236
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,600
Hello.

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,520
Hi.

238
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,640
My name’s Ice.

239
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,560
Okay.I’m here for the check-in.

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,600
Your full name?

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,360
Karun.

242
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Karan? Alright.

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,800
Karun.

244
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,040
Karun, Karun, Karun... Ok.

245
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,360
Got it, your name’s on the booking.

246
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,080
Shall we go?

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,600
Yes.

248
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
Elevator’s this way.

249
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,240
Come quickly, follow me.

250
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,960
Let me tell you something

251
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,360
your roommate is super handsome

252
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,200
super generous.

253
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,960
Exactly what you asked for.

254
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,880
And most importantly

255
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,480
he doesn’t bring people over.

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
These days

257
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,280
good roommates are rare but I found one for you.

258
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,840
It’s like the heavens gifted you this one.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,680
Here we are, 803.

260
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,040
Normally he’s back by now, classes are over.

261
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,720
Let’s try calling him.

262
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,760
(Mina)

263
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
No answer, maybe he’s not home.

264
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
But no worries.

265
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,360
Oh! No key needed?

266
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
It’s not locked.

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
He must be inside.

268
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,720
Come in, come in.

269
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,680
Follow me, Ice.

270
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,640
Nice, huh? Spacious and grand.

271
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,200
Yes.

272
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,920
Of course you’ll love it

273
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,720
I picked the best room for you.

274
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,280
So that's why he didn't pick up.

275
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,560
He’s in the shower, water’s running loud.

276
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,920
Have a seat.

277
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,400
Let’s do the paperwork.

278
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,360
Here, sign this.

279
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,640
This is the dorm contract.

280
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,720
Trust me, I don’t scam.

281
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,400
Pretty, isn’t it?

282
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,280
If you like it, then transfer the money.

283
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,640
Three months upfront, 21,000 baht deposit.

284
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
Transfer now?

285
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,440
Yes, right now. Don’t be shy.

286
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
Ah, perfect.

287
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
We’ll live comfortably,

288
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,240
like a family.

289
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,360
This room has two full air conditioners,

290
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,400
a huge TV, and also..

291
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,640
Oh my gosh, help me Lord!

292
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,120
Saint!

293
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
What are you doing here?

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
You two know each other?

295
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,600
This is the roommate you told me about?

296
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
There’s no way I can live with him.

297
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I’m out.

298
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,920
Ice, calm down.

299
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,240
Wait, calm down and talk first.

300
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
Saint, what’s going on?

301
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,560
Ice, wait! Calm down, honey.

302
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,560
If not here, then where will you stay?

303
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
Anywhere but here.

304
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
That’s not possible.

305
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,400
You signed the contract.

306
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,840
The deposit’s non-refundable.

307
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,600
What?!

308
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,920
Don’t “huh” me

309
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,760
read before you sign next time.

310
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,200
(Dormitory contract: three-month deposit.)

311
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
(No refund if tenant cancels.)

312
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
See?

313
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,119
See?

314
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,839
No refunds.

315
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,040
Here’s your key.

316
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,359
Be happy, now it’s my time to watch Gel Boy.

317
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:19,160
Stop holding back

318
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,960
just love first~ this version is the best.

319
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Hi.

320
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
This is our room.

321
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,960
Balcony’s on the left.

322
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,640
That’s my room, and here’s the bathroom.

323
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,840
On the right is...

324
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,120
my room and the kitchen.

325
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,880
Shared areas, we both clean.

326
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,600
Private space, don’t cross boundaries.

327
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,440
Electric and water bills, we split equally.

328
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,720
So don’t live lavishly, save energy.

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,440
Okay.

330
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,560
Night time is for resting and homework.

331
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,760
So don’t make noise.

332
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,360
I don’t make noise anyway.

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
No outsiders allowed

334
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,280
first to break the rule moves out.

335
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I'm not moving, you're the one moving out.

336
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Mmm, smells so good.

337
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Smells good and tastes good.

338
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,560
Better share it with Cee.

339
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,840
Might take a while, good food must be shared.

340
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,520
Be back soon, kids.

341
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,600
(So that’s why you two are avoiding each other?)

342
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,280
(Stop holding back, just love first~ Right?)

343
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,280
(Big kiss scene!)

344
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,000
Whoa, whoa!

345
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,920
Oh!

346
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,440
Oh my god, Ice, they’re on top of each other!

347
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Really? On top?!

348
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh, Saint, it’s just Mina, not an outsider.

349
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,040
Just me with a face mask on.

350
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,360
Not against the rules, right?

351
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
Let’s keep talking then.

352
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,200
Sure.

353
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,560
Wow, I’m loving this.

354
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,440
I like gel nails like these.Really?

355
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,040
I was thinking of getting mine done too.

356
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,280
But I’ll let them grow longer first.

357
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,920
What are you two talking about?

358
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,840
Let me join.

359
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,160
It's about a BL series, do you even get it?

360
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
Gel Boy, right?

361
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,640
Here’s the story.

363
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,040
What is it about?

364
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
You watch it? Move closer.

365
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,000
So, there’s FourMod, Bua, Babin, and Cheer.

366
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
Cheer likes Bua but Bua doesn’t like him back.

367
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,760
Then suddenly Cheer likes FourMod

368
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,040
so Bua pulls back.

369
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,840
It’s messy, see?

370
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,280
Look, look, this part.. see here?

371
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,000
It's so cool.

372
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,480
Uh, why are you sitting on top of each other?

373
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,680
(Sorry, I haven’t bought a laundry basket yet.)

374
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,760
Where else could you find a roommate like this?

375
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,520
Hey!

376
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Shit, it’s broken.

377
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
Do you even know how much this costs?

378
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,880
I’m sorry, I really didn’t know it was in there.

379
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
I’ll get it fixed.

380
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,600
Do you really have that

381
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,360
big a problem with leaving me alone?

382
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,640
But I never planned on leaving your life.

383
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,520
Stop. I don’t want to argue.

384
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,040
Just stop bothering me and

385
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,680
don’t be nice to me either.

386
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
At least be consistent.

387
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,680
Keep to yourself, don’t cross my line again.

388
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,680
That’s it.

389
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,200
Do you know this leaves glue marks?

390
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,640
If the landlord fines us, I’ll pay.

391
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,800
Stop acting like you care about me.

392
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,080
(P'Warm)

393
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,160
(Ice: P’Warm, I’ll leave my guitar there first）

394
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:22,440
（I’ll come get it another day.)

395
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,000
(Ice: Also, I’m auditioning for the music club.)

396
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
(Ice: But don’t worry, I won’t mention you at all.)

397
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
(Ice: Even though you barely show up）

398
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,920
（to the club anyway.)

399
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Hurts.

400
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,440
Don’t! Don’t!!

401
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I didn’t do it.

402
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,760
Dad, please! Dad, don’t hit me.

403
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,480
Stop! Get out!

404
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
I didn’t do anything.

405
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,200
Mom!

406
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,040
Hey! Anyone home? Can you hear me?

407
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
It’s time to pay up.

408
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,440
Hey!

409
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,520
Hey, check it out.

410
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,040
I’ll circle around back.

411
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,840
Should I climb the window?

412
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,720
Can you hear me or not?

413
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,320
(Saint: You should take care of your own life)

414
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey, open up.

415
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,160
(Saint: I won’t throw away my future）

416
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,760
（for someone with no future like you.)

417
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,160
Hey! Can you hear me?

418
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
(Saint: Don’t contact me again.)

419
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,440
Hey.

420
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,920
Open the door!

421
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,200
Open the door, don’t make me mad.

422
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Open it now.

423
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
Hey, open the door!

424
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Saint!

425
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,520
Saint!

426
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,840
Saint!

427
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Saint!

428
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Saint!

429
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Didn’t you say you’d never leave me?

430
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Didn’t you say you’d never leave me?

431
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
I never planned to leave you.

432
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Ice.

433
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Today’s the music club audition.

434
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,520
Anyone who is interested, step inside!

435
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
Strong potential here, all three of you

436
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,800
bright future.

437
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
How many did we get today?

438
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,160
About twenty.

439
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,360
Over twenty already, good turnout.

440
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,680
(Warm: Sorry, just saw this.)

441
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,320
(Warm: I don’t think you need to audition. ）

442
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,480
(You can just talk to me anytime.)

443
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,840
( Warm: ^_^)

444
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Hey, that’s a freshman, right?

445
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Are you a first year?

446
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,440
Oh, I’m Pas, the club president.

447
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,520
So, are you here to audition?

448
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,440
Why don't you go inside?

449
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,240
Uh… no, I’ll pass, thanks.

450
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,760
Don’t be shy, I’ll take you in.Come on.

451
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,400
Don’t be shy.

452
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,840
This way. Come in.

453
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,480
Sorry, excuse me.

454
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,080
Sorry.

455
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,800
Mud is so cool, bro! Damn!

456
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,760
He can lift that, come on, show us!

457
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,520
I’ll be back in a bit.

458
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,840
Wave for the crowd! Wave!

459
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,800
And that’s just a taste of our music club.

460
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,200
If you have passion and talent,

461
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,760
don’t be shy.

462
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,520
Come sign up and audition with us.

463
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,800
Our doors are open to everyone.

464
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
But for you..

465
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
we don’t take trash like you.

466
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,360
Get lost.

467
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
Then how did they accept you?

468
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,840
What do you mean by that?

469
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Things always seem hard

470
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,040
to get through that thich skull of yours.

471
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,240
Are you mocking me?

472
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,120
Why don’t you think for once?

473
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,360
Wow, why don't you think for yourself?

474
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,200
Mus! Hey! Stop!

475
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
What are you trying to do?

476
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,440
This way, please.Thanks.

477
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
Hey, Saint, perfect timing.

478
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I’ve got a question

479
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,160
about the budget for the songwriting contest

480
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,960
how much did we get?

481
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,560
So we know

482
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
who we’ll invite as judges.

483
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,560
Not sure yet, we need to wait for the dean.

484
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,280
That’ll take forever.

485
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,840
Hey, what the hell?

486
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,800
You’ve crossed the line.

487
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,120
Mud, chill.That Mud’s voice?

488
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,640
Shit, is he picking a fight with a freshmen?

489
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,720
You want to fight?

490
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,960
Mud! Stop!

491
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,880
Mud!

492
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Pas, good to see you.

493
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Been here long?

494
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,239
Long enough to hear you picking on freshmen.

495
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,400
Today’s recruitment day, can’t you behave?

496
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,199
Sorry on Mud’s behalf.

497
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,480
Our club welcomes talent and passion in music.

498
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,120
But Ice doesn’t seem to have either.

499
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,520
Go look for another club.

500
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,120
And what you just showed, you call that talent?

501
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,560
Wait, hey, kid. Shit…

502
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Calm down. Take it easy.

503
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,120
Don’t leave yet.

504
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,800
Mud, apologize to him.

505
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,840
Go on.

506
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Then let’s see it.

507
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,800
Show us what you’ve got, Ice.

508
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Fine.

509
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
Hey! What are you doing?

510
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,640
(Do you still remember the day we were in love?)

511
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,120
(I remember every second that I had you.)

512
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,000
(I still see you so clearly.)

513
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,240
(All our things are still in the same spot.)

514
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,640
Hoooo

515
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,080
(Even if our love ended, no matter how long ago,)

516
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:27,480
(that doesn't mean my heart can't start over.)

517
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,160
(Is it still me that you love?)

518
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,840
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

519
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,200
(My heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

520
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,720
(Change these cold nights )

521
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,360
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

522
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,120
(That's all I want to ask.)

523
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,880
Ice, the song you sang earlier

524
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
did you write it yourself?

525
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,280
Yes, I did.

526
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,640
Wow, that was really impressive.

527
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,840
I hope you don’t take Mud’s words to heart.

528
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,080
And congratulations, you passed the audition.

529
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,640
Even if it wasn’t your intention. Yay!

530
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,000
I’d like you to join our club.

531
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,960
Thank you, but… no troublemakers, right?

532
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,480
Just Mud and Ten.

533
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,440
But if you mean Saint, he’s not in our club.

534
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,120
Why would you even invite Ice in, Pas?

535
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,520
He’s a troublemaker.

536
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,920
Well, if we accepted you and Ten,

537
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,600
why not him?

538
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,600
What?

539
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,720
It’s been a while since we had a strong songwriter.

540
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,040
Help us? Ok?

541
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,040
Gotta go.

542
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,400
He’s gone.

543
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,520
Come on.

544
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,600
What? Hurry.

545
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,720
What? Quickly.

546
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Mud, what the hell are you doing?

547
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,200
That’s his bag.

548
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
There’s no way a guy like him

549
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,000
could write good songs himself.

550
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,400
I bet he copied from someone.

551
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,840
If we find proof, he’ll get kicked out of the club.

552
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,760
Better yet, maybe even the university.

553
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,880
But if he didn’t copy,

554
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,640
then we’ll be the ones expelled.

555
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,280
Just search, maybe we’ll find something.

556
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,560
Still questions in my heart

557
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,640
I’ve never spoken out loud…

558
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,360
What the hell is this?

559
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,000
I can’t even read it.

560
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
Shit, he's coming.

561
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,520
Quickly.

562
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,960
What the hell are you doing?

563
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,880
Mud? What are you doing?

564
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,720
Just a sec.

565
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,120
He's near! He's nearly here!

566
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,680
Come on Mus, let's go.

567
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:07,960
(If you want it back)

568
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,560
(see you at 7pmat the side of the university.)

569
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Hey.

570
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,040
Give me back my notebook.

571
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah, I'll give it back.

572
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,320
But you have to proove

573
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,400
that you didn't copy someone's song.

574
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,840
What right do you have to steal my things?

575
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Give it back!

576
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,120
So many feelings we both keep inside.

577
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,200
Wouldn’t it be better if you felt the same too?

578
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,120
Whoa, that gave me chills.

579
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,360
My heart’s racing, really racing listening to that.

580
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Did you write it yourself?

581
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,840
Here, next to it

582
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
he even wrote down happy memories

583
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,120
he did for the other person too.

584
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,440
Ooh, who could that guy be?

585
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,000
Mind your own damn business.

586
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,840
I said give me back my stuff.

587
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,520
Hey, he’s mad now.

588
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,280
Whoa, I’m actually scared.

589
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,920
Mad?

590
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
I think someone like you

591
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,840
doesn’t even need to be in school.

592
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,680
Just wasting a spot.

593
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,240
All you do is cause trouble, nothing but a burden.

594
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,200
Wherever you go, you bring people bad luck.

595
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,680
Even your parents didn’t want you.

596
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,800
Bastard!

597
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,480
Shit, he really punched you!

598
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,200
Let go!

599
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,240
I said let go!

600
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,800
It’s my stuff, why are you messing with it?

601
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,680
You let go!

602
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,440
I won’t let go!

603
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Let go!

604
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
You hit my friend?

605
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
You asshole!

606
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,720
No, you’re the asshole!

607
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,520
Ice!

608
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,120
Mud! Ten! Ice!

609
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,480
Damn it! Ice! Stop!

610
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:11,880
Hey!

611
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,680
What's wrong with you?

612
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,240
Stop right now!

613
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,760
What the hell

614
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,440
Didn’t you hear me?

615
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,600
why do you keep messing with me?

616
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,880
As the president of the student council

617
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,360
I’m ordering you two to stop!

618
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Lanee, you saw it right? He hit me first!

619
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,120
This is Ice, right?

620
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,400
Tell me what really happened.

621
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
We were just walking here.

622
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,280
And then he rushed up and punched me!

623
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
I asked Ice.

624
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
Come on, talk it out properly

625
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,360
so there’s no misunderstanding.

626
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,600
Ice!

627
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,240
Look at him!

628
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
Who does he think he is acting like that?

629
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,120
You have to punish him!

630
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,240
Mud, before you threw the punch, what happened?

631
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,040
Did you provoke him?

632
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
Why are you saying that?

633
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
You’re supposed to be my friend!

634
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
I said tell me the truth!

635
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,840
It's all torn up.

636
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,840
You dropped this.

637
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,440
I told Mud no fighting on campus and

638
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,840
he just goes and do it right beside school walls?

639
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
The lyrics are pretty interesting though

640
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,000
Wait? You read it?

641
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
How else would I know what it is?

642
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,760
So many feelings we both keep inside…

643
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,360
Are you mocking me?

644
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,400
Damn it, let go!

645
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,720
Calm down and just listen!

646
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:23,960
I’m not listening!

647
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,080
Where’d you even learn this move?

648
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,440
What temple did you train at?

649
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,600
Let me go, Saint!

650
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,760
If you don’t stop, don’t blame me for what happens

651
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,200
I won’t stop, what will you do?

652
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,040
Let go!

653
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,480
Saint!

654
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,200
What are you doing?

655
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,360
Are you crazy?

656
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,920
Let me go, Saint!

657
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,920
Don’t!

658
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,080
Stay still!

659
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,280
It hurts, Saint, let me go!

660
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,400
Why are you so strong?

661
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,920
Saint, let me go!

662
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,080
Stay still!

663
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,880
What are you doing?

664
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,920
Where are you going? Untie me first!

665
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,000
Come back here!

666
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,120
Where are you going?

667
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,040
Saint!

668
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,440
What are you doing? Let me go right now!

669
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Leave me alone.

670
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,360
You’ll just end up hurt.

671
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Why are you so stubborn?

672
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,040
Hey, you’re too close.

673
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
You’re crossing the line.

674
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,960
Satisfied now?

675
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,560
Tell me honestly

676
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,920
do you really think I’d bully your song?

677
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
What do you take me for?

678
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,520
Looking at me now

679
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,920
that’s exactly the kind of person you are.

680
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,840
I’m sorry, I know it’s not enough

681
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,560
but still, I’m sorry.

682
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,080
(P’Sea)

683
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,920
Untie me first, P’Sea is calling, hurry!

684
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,480
Nope, you’ll just punch me.

685
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,240
Then how am I supposed to answer?

686
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,120
Hurry! What if it’s something important?

687
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,240
(P’Sea)

688
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,680
Saint!

689
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,160
Hello, Sea.

690
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,160
(Hello, Ice.)

691
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,040
Hi, what’s up?

692
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,120
Saint, you bastard!

693
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,040
You idiot! Damn it!

694
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,360
Hello, Sea.

695
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,120
Tomorrow at 3 PM

696
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,960
come record the test casting for Sin’s role, okay?

697
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,120
I already announced auditions for Kit’s role.

698
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,720
A lot of people are interested.

699
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,000
I’ve selected the ones I think

700
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,360
would match with you.

701
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,520
Got it.

702
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,840
Hey, Saint, come back and untie me first!

703
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,120
Alright everyone, ready?

704
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,280
I’ll be giving you a scene

705
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,360
that’s a little different from the actual script.

706
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,640
Look at scene eight.

707
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,160
Sin, whose eyesight is failing

708
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,360
tries to grab something to wipe his tears.

709
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,440
He ends up picking up Kit’s shirt.

710
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,600
Sin accidentally smells it without realizing

711
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,760
just as Kit walks in and sees it.

712
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,360
Any questions?

713
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,080
Any questions?

714
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,000
Don’t you think Kit is too harsh on Sin?

715
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,600
Such a red flag.

716
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,880
True, but we have to understand

717
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,640
that the social context backthen was different.

718
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,000
He was under heavy pressure from society.

719
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,240
So sexual aggression was stronger

720
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,280
than in today’s world.

721
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,400
That’s what our film is trying to show.

722
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,840
Any other questions?

723
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,920
If I play with my eyes closed like this

724
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,240
how do I act?

725
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,280
Just act like you can’t see your partner.

726
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,440
The real Sin couldn’t see, he was in pain.

727
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,840
This NC scene is crucial.

728
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,720
We need an actor with fiery chemistry with you.

729
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
Even if you can’t make eye

730
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,040
contact with your partner.

731
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,840
Basically, pick the person you feel the most with.

732
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,240
Okay, let’s begin.

733
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Alright.

734
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,680
Okay, first person, come on in.

735
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,400
Three.

736
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,240
Two.

737
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,080
One.

738
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,800
Action!

739
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,160
Hey, what are you doing?

740
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,400
Do you like me? Answer me!

741
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,960
Cut!

742
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,160
Okay, thank you, you can go now.

743
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,160
Whoa, I just watched your clip, you were so hot

744
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,680
Hey hey, please step out, okay?

745
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,200
And how did you even get in here?

746
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,280
Ice, are you okay?

747
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,720
Ok?

748
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,240
Okay, next person please

749
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,600
Uh, sorry, who’s this?

750
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,200
This is the last one, right?

751
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,560
Yeah… if we still can’t find the right one, then...

752
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
It’s fine.

753
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,640
Yeah.

754
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,280
Third person, you’re up.

755
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,960
Here already?

756
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,840
Oh, okay.

757
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,720
Alright, everyone to your places.

758
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,800
Ready?

759
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,600
Okay.

760
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,000
Third person, please.

761
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Three.

762
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Two.

763
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
One.

764
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
Action!

765
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,880
What the hell are you doing?

766
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,280
Nothing, I didn’t do anything.

767
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,120
Don't! I didn't do anything!

768
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:08,800
I didn't do it!

769
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,840
No! I didn't!

770
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,120
Give it to me!

771
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Let go, I didn’t do anything!

772
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,960
Didn’t do anything? Then what’s this?

773
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Kit, are you inside, son?

774
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,440
Kit!

775
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
Kit!

776
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,960
I heard him just now.

777
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,120
You like me, right?

778
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,800
Answer me.

779
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,160
Cut!

780
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,840
That was wonderful!

781
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,480
I loved it.That's was so good!

782
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,760
Yeah.

783
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,440
Saint... You..

784
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,760
Are you a child?

785
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,360
You're the child!

786
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
You keep following me around.

787
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,200
Why are you so confident?

788
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,560
Then tell my why did you audition for this role?

789
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,840
Can I ask you something?

790
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,240
Can you return this diary to Ice for me?

791
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,040
Reading someone else's diary is rude, you know.

792
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,160
But I think there are some things you should know.

793
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,640
Why do you like red sunflowers?

794
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,840
Because it probably caught my eye

795
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,000
the moment I walked in.

796
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,640
If that's the case, I'll be willing to work hard.

797
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,320
I'll go study communication arts with you myself.

798
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,960
What?

799
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,520
Now that we're close, we can study together.

800
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,880
If something's bothering you

801
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,240
you can always come and talk to me.

802
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,480
So, have you managed to get the money

803
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,640
to pay off your father's debt yet?

804
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,040
After that incident, I decided to drop out.

805
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,600
I think maybe this shitty, broken life

806
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,200
is probably fitting for someone unlucky like me.
