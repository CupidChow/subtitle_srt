1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Be with me?

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,920
Okay, my girlfriend.~

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,160
I realized I like you.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,400
Can you like me back?

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,800
What are you doing?!

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,560
Mom!

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,440
Dad is gone.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,000
Then...

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
Then why didn’t you tell me?

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,400
Didn't you tell me not to contact you?

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,119
You don’t have to be afraid of anything now.

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
From now on, I'll be by your side.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,080
Ice!

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,560
Dad, is this him?

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,440
Yes.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,320
Why did you never tell me

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,360
that my brother was this handsome?

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,040
Are you leaving already?

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
I was going to invite you to stay for dinner.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to leave now.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,000
Thank you so much for inviting me.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,560
Happy birthday in advance.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Take this to have on the way.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,640
Thank you.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,440
It's almost Ice's birthday.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
Happy birthday in advance!

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,320
Thank you.

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,720
Next time we're in Bangkok,

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
let's have dinner.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,240
Sure.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,400
Thank you.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,000
But I have to go now.

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Well..

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,280
Good bye.

36
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,880
You should go.

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll take care of this.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Thank you.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,880
Good bye.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,280
Good bye.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,240
(I hope you enjoy it.)

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I invited you all here.

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
Because I want to talk to the director.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,280
I understand you're filming a short film.

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
So is this a scene from the film or what.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
It was during a break.

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,560
And did they have to hug.

48
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
Uncle.

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
That day Ice’s mom.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,440
She arrived right when we were filming.

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,959
And Ice had a small misunderstanding with his mom.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
So Saint went to comfort him.

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,160
That’s all.

54
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,760
Yes.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
As a director, if the actors aren’t comfortable.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It’s hard to continue shooting.

57
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,960
But if outsiders see this.

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,840
They’ll think differently.

59
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,480
I don’t think there’s anything strange here, uncle.

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,280
So does that mean you and Saint.

61
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,600
Are actually dating?

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, we’ve been together for a long time.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,560
As friends.

64
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,240
Friends?!

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,240
I’d never think of Saint as anything more.

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,840
Mr.Khom.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
Mom.

68
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
What is this.

69
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,000
I was investigating the short film they shot.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But now I’m suspicious about something else.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,280
So what exactly are Lanee and Saint?

72
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,520
Are they dating? Mrs.Jan?

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
I’ll speak with my daughter first.

74
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I’ll go too.

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
What is going on, Lanee?

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
I want to know everything.

77
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,760
Actually.

78
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I’m dating Sea.

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Why?

80
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,160
You’ve never told me anything.

81
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,600
I’m sorry mom.

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
But I’ve been really uncomfortable.

83
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,760
And I think I need to tell you.

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
That I don’t like Saint.

85
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
You can be angry at me.

86
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,560
But I just don’t want to lie to myself anymore.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don’t want to lie to others.

88
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,440
And I don’t want to lie to you anymore.

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,760
Lanee.

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,440
If you told me earlier.

91
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,920
I wouldn’t have arranged your engagement with Saint.

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,560
What do you mean?

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,920
Since you said you’re dating Sea.

94
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm not stopping you.

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
But

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,720
the problem now is,

97
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I need to clear things up with Saint’s dad.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,640
I have one last question for you.

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes.

100
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,920
What are you and Saint?

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,680
We’re just actors working together.

102
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
I think it’s normal.

103
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,440
For actors to support each other.

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,080
Saint and I are professional.

105
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,000
We don’t bring personal feelings into work.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,760
If you have questions about the filming process.

107
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
You can ask me.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,640
Mr.Khom.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We need to talk.

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,880
Yes, Mrs.Jan.

111
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Will you be okay.

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
If our kids don’t get engaged.

113
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
Our kids must get married.

114
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,200
My daughter is dating Sea.

115
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
And I let her choose who she likes.

116
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,680
About making the kids post their online status

117
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,440
as dating..

118
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
I think we should remove it.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,840
If we announce they’re not together.

120
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,159
Investors will pull out.

121
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Khom.

122
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,840
You need to accept reality.

123
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,200
And I’m sure.

124
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
You already have a backup plan.

125
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,800
Right?

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,240
I think for now.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
We shouldn’t do anything

128
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,760
that will alarm the investors.

129
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
I think.

130
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,680
I need to reconsider you again.

131
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,040
Sorry.

132
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,720
For bringing you to meet my dad.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,160
It’s okay.

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
How was my acting?

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,440
Did I really look stressed?

136
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,080
Saint and I work professionally.

137
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,760
Don’t worry.

138
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,440
I’m fine.

139
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
Wait.

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,200
Saint.

141
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Is my Dad still making you follow me?

142
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
I’m really sorry.

143
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I don’t want to do this.

144
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
I’ve been following you guys on set.

145
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Now I can’t keep up with class.

146
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,680
If you don’t want to do it then

147
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
why do it.

148
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,760
I have to.

149
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,480
If I don’t.

150
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,560
Your dad won’t keep me and my mom.

151
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,440
I don’t know if

152
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
You two actually like each other or not.

153
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
But I have my own life.

154
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,000
If possible.

155
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,320
I want you two to

156
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,560
cause less drama and be less suspicious.

157
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
So I won’t have to follow you anymore.

158
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,040
Tonight you two should stay separately.

159
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Because your dad wants me and my mom to

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,800
monitor you both.

161
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,360
I’ll go then.

162
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,280
Woo!

163
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,840
And now we have

164
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,400
the last two awards.

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,480
The two songs announced

166
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
will be performed at the university countdown event

167
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
on New Year’s Eve.

168
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,800
And without further delay.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,640
The first runner-up award.

170
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,800
Goes to!!

171
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,200
Red Sunflower!

172
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,560
to Red Sunflower!!!

173
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
By Karun Thongdee.

174
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,760
Woohoo!! Yay!!

175
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Yes.

176
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,680
Great job everyone.

177
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,200
Amazing.

178
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,960
Yes.

179
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,520
Let’s go.

180
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,280
Ice let’s go.

181
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,440
Woohoo!!

182
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,360
Let’s go.

183
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,920
I told you we could do it.

184
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
I loved it, I loved it too.

185
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes.

186
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
Hello.

187
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,920
Hello.

188
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,120
Let’s invite the university president.

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Mr.Nikom Saengarunawong to present the award

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,040
and take some photos.

191
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,880
Let it stay a secret love,

192
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,600
like the lyrics say.

193
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,880
Thank you.

194
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Let’s get a photo of the whole band.

195
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
Is there something you dislike?

196
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,680
Since you gave it zero points.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,440
Music is subjective, Mrs.Jan.

198
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh.

199
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,000
I see.

200
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,480
Seems like our preferences.

201
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,040
Are very different.

202
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
(Scores for Songwriting Competition 2025)

203
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,360
(Total: 0/100)

204
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
Woo!

205
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
Ice.

206
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,560
You’re incredible.

207
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,720
Second place.

208
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Mud, sit down. This my homie!

209
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,240
I told you Ice has talent.

210
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Because you helped me record it.

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,960
You helped me so much.

212
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
So cool, bro.

213
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,360
Come on, let's celebrate.

214
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go!

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,920
One time!

216
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Yay!

217
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,920
Ice,

218
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,920
isn't Saint going to come?

219
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,640
He's not coming.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,560
Probably busy with stuff at home.

221
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
Oh.

222
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
And you, did you get

223
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,600
an idea for the song performance yet?

224
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,160
I’ve thought of some ideas.

225
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
But nothing solid yet.

226
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Ice, you can schedule practice with me tomorrow.

227
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Maybe while practicing,

228
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,320
you’ll think of something.

229
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
Music practice?

230
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes!

231
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,560
I’m free anyway.

232
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,600
Are you free?

233
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,280
Yeah.

234
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,800
We’ll go.

235
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,880
We won’t miss it.

236
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,000
Really.

237
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
Let me come too.

238
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,960
Hey, I’ll find a practice room for you guys.

239
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,920
Don’t worry about me.

240
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,680
Then

241
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
tomorrow let’s practice music together.

242
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,280
Let’s do it.

243
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Let’s do it!

244
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,200
Woohoo!

245
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Music practice, bro!

246
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
Hey,

247
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
we still don’t have a club group photo.

248
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
Should we take a group picture.

249
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,280
Yeah sure!

250
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
That's a good idea.

251
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,720
How do we take it?

252
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Well,

253
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
who will take it.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,720
Me?

255
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Is that okay.

256
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay.

257
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
Okay.

258
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,840
Okay.

259
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,560
Here.

260
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,080
Okay.

261
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,960
Closer.

262
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,480
Okay.

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
Everyone ready.

264
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,240
Ready.

265
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
One.

266
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,840
Two.

267
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Three.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Today I got scolded by my dad again.

269
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,640
Just accept it.

270
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,880
Your dad won’t let you go easily.

271
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,160
Yeah.

272
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
When will I get to be with Ice?

273
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
There will be a day.

274
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,520
When your dad accepts it.

275
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh.

276
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,080
Oh, Saint.

277
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,760
Don’t tell me you’re sleeping here again?

278
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,200
Then where am I supposed to sleep?

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,600
You two sleep in that room.

280
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,200
I’ll sleep here.

281
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,920
Okay.

282
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,720
Mud.

283
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t get drunk.

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,280
Huh.

285
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t get drunk.

286
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,800
I am drunk.

287
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,760
Book, do you know.

288
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,560
Ten didn’t walk me home.

289
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,080
Such a shitty person.

290
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,680
He ran off before it was even dark.

291
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
But at least Ice came to drop me off.

292
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,240
Otherwise I’d be wasted.

293
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,960
What?

294
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Go shower first.

295
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,920
Can I just sleep. You reek of alcohol.

296
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,720
Go. I’ll just sleep.

297
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,800
Go shower.

298
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,040
I’ll shower tomorrow.

299
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Go shower.

300
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,800
I'll take one tomorrow.

301
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
Then I’ll take you.

302
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,520
Will you go.

303
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
But you have to wash me.

304
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,680
I’ll take you.

305
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,160
How is it going to be?

306
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,160
Okay, okay.

307
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,280
Let’s go.

308
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,079
Let’s go.

309
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,200
Fast.

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,359
Go quickly.

311
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,240
I’m going to shower with my boyfriend, Saint.

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,440
See you, bro.

313
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,000
Go fast.

314
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
It’s cold.

315
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Next time don’t drink so much.

316
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,560
Then what should I do?

317
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,680
My heart loves it.

318
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,000
Are you addicted to alcohol?

319
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,840
Not addicted to alcohol.

320
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,200
I’m addicted to you.

321
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,680
Love you.

322
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,600
What are you saying.

323
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
Wait.

324
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,720
Saint is here.

325
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,520
Good,

326
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,000
makes it exciting.

327
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,440
Hello.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
Who is this?

329
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,920
It’s me.

330
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,040
Saint.

331
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,000
I’m using Book’s phone to call.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Oh.

333
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,200
I’m not coming back to the room tonight.

334
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
I know.

335
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,960
Congrats

336
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
on the award.

337
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,120
Thanks.

338
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
You can come take pictures with the trophy too.

339
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,360
I brought it to the room already.

340
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Sure.

341
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,960
Yeah.

342
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
And the headphones

343
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,040
with your engraved name arrived yet?

344
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,520
Yeah.

345
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,440
Thanks.

346
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
It arrived faster than I expected.

347
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
I like it.

348
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,560
It’s nothing.

349
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Ice.

350
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,760
I’m sorry.

351
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,320
For just standing there today.

352
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
You handled everything alone.

353
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,680
This is already good enough.

354
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,440
Bear.

355
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I’m sorry.

356
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
That I used the song you helped write

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
and didn’t credit you.

358
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
It’s okay.

359
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,920
This song is my gift to you.

360
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,520
Yeah.

361
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,360
Our lives right now are like the poet Li Bai.

362
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
How?

363
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Are you going to jump into the river

364
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,040
and chase the moon?

365
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,360
If I could, I would.

366
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,880
Then why didn’t you come?

367
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,640
Your dad’s henchman isn’t following you anymore,

368
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,600
right?

369
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
And where’s my phone

370
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,400
Give it to Book.

371
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,680
But anyway tomorrow.

372
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
You have to come see me.

373
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,560
Yeah.

374
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,240
Okay.

375
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I’ll hurry to you tomorrow.

376
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
Good night.

377
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,320
Good night.

378
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
When did you come back?

379
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,200
A while ago.

380
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,280
I saw your trophy.

381
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
It's not only my trophy.

382
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,800
It’s your trophy too.

383
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Is this washed already?

384
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,240
Yeah.

385
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,120
But

386
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,520
there are still the white clothes

387
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
that haven’t been washed yet.

388
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,840
Hey, do you have any?

389
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Then we can wash them together with this pile.

390
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah, I do.

391
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,160
A lot too.

392
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Don’t forget your in-ears in your pocket again.

393
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Are you crazy?

394
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,760
If I forget them, the one who’ll be sad is you.

395
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Yeah right.

396
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
Come on,

397
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,920
I’ll help hang them.

398
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,760
By the way,

399
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
this feels like that scene we filmed, right?

400
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The one where Seen and Kit were hanging clothes.

401
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,440
Hey!

402
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,880
So that's how you're going to play?

403
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,520
Come on.

404
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,880
Doesn’t look like it at all.

405
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
In that scene…

406
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,880
they were about to kiss, right?

407
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,400
What kiss?

408
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
I mean the scene where the mom interrupted them

409
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
and found out that Seen and Kit liked each other?

410
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,600
But

411
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
the mom isn’t here yet.

412
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,160
Hello, Pas?

413
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,640
Hello, Ice.

414
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,280
The music practice room is full,

415
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,560
so we’re thinking of practicing

416
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,000
at my home studio instead.

417
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,440
Sure.

418
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,280
Can you send me the location

419
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,520
so I can go there?

420
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,000
No need,

421
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
I’ll pick you up.

422
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,520
Uh…

423
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,440
Okay..

424
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,080
Then I’ll send you my location.

425
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,840
You’re going to practice?

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,720
Yeah.

427
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
I’ll drive you.

428
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,400
Hey,

429
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,800
it’s fine.

430
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,200
Pas is coming to pick me up.

431
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I’ll take you myself.

432
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,120
Hey.

433
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Just drop me here.

434
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Today…

435
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,040
Can I go in and watch you practice?

436
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,960
Huh?

437
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,200
Ice.

438
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,120
Hi, Pas.

439
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Am I late?

440
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
No, not at all.

441
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,280
Ten and Mud just arrived too.

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
How did Saint end up dropping you off?

443
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,320
Uh..

444
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Well, I was with Ice.

445
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,880
Pas,

446
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,680
can I watch you and Ice practice today?

447
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
Ice, is that okay?

448
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, it’s fine.

449
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Just relax.

450
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,960
Make yourself at home.

451
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,120
Your place is really cozy.

452
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Do you collect vintage stuff too?

453
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,160
Oh.

454
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,520
These are all my dad’s.

455
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,880
He likes vintage things.

456
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,800
Pas!

457
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
This one is a rare model!

458
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I remember there are only like 200 of these.

459
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,320
Yeah.

460
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,200
My dad bought it for my mom

461
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
when he proposed to her.

462
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,840
And you, Ice? Is there a guitar you want?

463
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,600
Of course.

464
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,520
What model? Tell me,

465
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,720
maybe I can find it for you.

466
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,360
Well…

467
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
actually…

468
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,160
from this brand.

469
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,840
Oh. It looks pretty similar.

470
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,200
(Thank you for coming into my life)

471
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,040
(as a ray of sunshine,)

472
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,640
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

473
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,120
(from once withered to bloom again.)

474
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,320
(Thank you for making everyday)

475
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,160
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

476
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,040
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

477
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:28,480
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

478
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,120
Whoa.

479
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
This mic sounds insanely good.

480
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,200
Of course it does.

481
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,680
This is the Sennheiser MD 421.

482
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,200
Almost twenty thousand baht each.

483
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,800
You can use it for concerts and studio recording.

484
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,480
Do you like it?

485
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,760
I do.

486
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,640
Then I’ll give it to you.

487
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,640
Pas.

488
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,560
No, it’s okay.

489
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,760
I can’t accept it.

490
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,600
Just think of it as your birthday present.

491
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
I really can’t, I’d feel too bad.

492
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,560
Keep it.

493
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,920
I really want you to use it.

494
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,440
Okay.

495
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,640
Sure. Thank you so much.

496
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,240
So, how was what we practiced earlier?

497
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,200
Was it okay?

498
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,880
Yeah.

499
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,640
I think the instruments were a bit loud at the start.

500
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,640
Maybe if we bring Ice’s vocal up, it’d be clearer?

501
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,480
Hey, Saint,

502
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,160
you know music too?

503
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,240
No.

504
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,480
I just think listeners

505
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,360
would want to hear Ice’s voice clearly.

506
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,720
Hmm.

507
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,760
He’s right.

508
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,920
Then let’s give Ice a solo for the first verse.

509
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
The rest of us will come in

510
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,560
on verse 2 and 3.

511
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,480
Ice, you can do a low baritone there.

512
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,000
I’ll follow a bit behind.

513
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Let’s make it verse 3 a dominant chord.

514
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,680
It's a C#7.

515
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,920
Let’s switch to A, then C#7,

516
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,360
then F# minor, how’s that? Yeah.

517
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,840
Yeah, that works. Yes, perfect.

518
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,280
Okay.

519
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,360
Let’s run it again.

520
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,200
Yep.

521
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,240
Ice?

522
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Should we try flying a drone like this?

523
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,600
It looks cool.

524
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Aren’t you going overboard?

525
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,080
It’s just a university project.

526
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,640
We’ll think about it later.

527
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,160
Let’s continue practice.

528
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,880
Chord.

529
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Okay everyone, let’s keep going.

530
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,960
Okay.

531
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,000
Alright, ready?

532
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,640
Let’s try again.

533
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,240
If you’re stressed,

534
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,120
why not let the music carry you a bit?

535
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,880
Do you always play music when you’re stressed?

536
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,240
Yep.

537
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,520
I think everyone has a song

538
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,280
or melody they use to heal themselves.

539
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,400
Do you have one?

540
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
I used to.

541
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,680
But now…

542
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,000
I feel like my song

543
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,240
is becoming someone else’s song somehow.

544
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,280
Oh?

545
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,920
Why do you think that?

546
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,320
Maybe someone else

547
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,280
can play that song better than me.

548
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,200
Hmm.

549
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
I think…

550
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
everyone

551
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
has different strengths.

552
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,720
Like Robert Greene said in

553
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,920
The Art of Seduction,

554
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,200
he said that

555
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,000
you don’t have to be good in the same way as others.

556
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,080
You just need to be good at being yourself.

557
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,880
If my dad

558
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,920
understood even half of what you just said,

559
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,360
understood even half of what you just said,

560
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,480
Um..

561
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,960
I think I know now.

562
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
Thank you so much.

563
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,000
But I’ll excuse myself for now.

564
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,520
Oh? Alright.

565
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,000
Okay.

566
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:04,840
Thank you.

567
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Good-bye.

568
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,560
Pas, thanks for bringing me home.

569
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
I had to come set up the mic anyway.

570
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,400
But I just found out

571
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,880
you live in this apartment.

572
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, I rent here.

573
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,120
Saint helps split the cost,

574
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,400
so it’s not expensive.

575
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,600
Oh, so you live with Saint?

576
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,440
Yeah.

577
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,000
How was practice today?

578
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,040
Good.

579
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,520
I got to try some new things.

580
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,280
I’ll have to prepare a lot more for next time.

581
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,840
Yeah.

582
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,520
But if I have more ideas,

583
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,000
I’ll tell you right away.

584
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,760
I’m sure one day you’ll be an amazing artist.

585
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Let me get your autograph now.

586
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,160
Right here.

587
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,640
That’ll be a long time from now.

588
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,680
For now, I’ll just practice with the mic you gave me.

589
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,480
So that I'm used to it.

590
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,080
Alright.

591
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,240
Give it a try.

592
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
This is my room.

593
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,199
Wow,

594
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,719
it’s pretty big.

595
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,159
Make yourself at home.

596
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Happy birthday to you~

597
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,000
Happy birthday to you~

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,360
Happy birthday, happy birthday~

599
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:43,000
Happy birthday to you~

600
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,840
Woo!

601
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,480
Wishing you lots of happiness,

602
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,360
wealth, great health,

603
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,480
and may whoever you love love you back.

604
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Happy birthday, Ice!

605
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,000
Wishing you lots of happiness.

606
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,520
Make a wish!

607
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,920
Saint made this specially for you,

608
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,520
super limited edition.

609
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,840
This recipe, Ice used to love it as a kid.

610
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,600
Here, go season the pork.

611
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,200
Hey.

612
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
Smells good, right?

613
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,120
Yay!

614
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
Thank you so much, everyone.

615
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,320
Happy birthday, Ice!

616
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,400
Have lots of happiness!

617
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
It’s okay, Ice.

618
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,040
I’ll come set up your mic again next time.

619
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,800
Happy birthday.

620
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Have fun celebrating with your friends.

621
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,000
Pas,

622
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,480
stay and have cake with us first.

623
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,360
Alright.

624
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,560
Here,

625
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,200
try it.

626
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,280
See if it tastes good.

627
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,720
Sticky rice waterfall grilled pork cake.

628
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,040
How did you even come up with this?

629
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
It tastes just like Mom’s.

630
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,320
Actually,

631
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
your mom helped me make it.

632
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,280
Hi.

633
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,040
Mom?

634
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Happy birthday, honey.

635
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480
Mom…

636
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,080
I hope you’re the happiest you’ve ever been.

637
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
Mom.

638
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,160
Here’s your birthday present.

639
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,920
I rushed over so this is all I've got.

641
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,880
The money you sent me.

642
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,520
I never spent it.

643
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,000
I saved it all for you.

644
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,520
And I’ve been saving my own money too.

645
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,120
I thought…

646
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,840
if someday we got a chance to live together again,

647
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
you won’t have to struggle anymore.

648
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I’m sorry that all this time

649
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,880
I’ve been such a useless mother.

650
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,400
Don’t say that, Mom.

651
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
I’ve been a coward.

652
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,920
I’ve been selfish.

653
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
I always thought that

654
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,880
if I could turn back time,

655
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,520
I would storm in and take my child back,

656
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,120
no matter what happened.

657
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
Live or die,

658
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,240
come what may.

659
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,280
And when you called me,

660
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
I shouldn’t have pushed you away like that.

661
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,920
It’s all in the past now, Mom.

662
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,160
Back then we were both just doing the best we could.

663
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,440
Your hand,

664
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
what happened to it?

665
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,640
Nothing, Mom.

666
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,000
Don’t worry about it.

667
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,120
Ice,

668
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,160
tell me the truth.

669
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,840
When I was running away from the debt collectors…

670
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,600
I fell while running

671
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,600
and something cut my hand.

672
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,800
Did it hurt a lot, sweetheart?

673
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,960
Not really.

674
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,520
Everything just felt numb at that moment.

675
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,040
I’m sorry.

676
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,160
I’m so sorry.

677
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,040
I’m really sorry.

678
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,000
It’s okay, Mom.

679
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,360
(Ice: Get home safely.)

680
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,520
(Kaew: heart sticker)

681
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,000
How are you?

682
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,600
Your mom already left?

683
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah.

684
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,400
She had to rush back to look after the homestay.

685
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,120
Look.

686
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,680
She even sent me a heart sticker.

687
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
I’m sorry for not telling you first

688
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,720
about inviting your mom.

689
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,440
Thank you, Saint.

690
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,480
It’s the best gift I’ve ever received in my life.

691
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,480
Yeah.

692
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Seeing you happy

693
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,200
makes me happy too.

694
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,000
Ice…

695
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
I might not be good at guitar,

696
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,160
and

697
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
I might not understand music the way you do,

698
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
but I want to stay by your side

699
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
and keep supporting

700
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,360
you like always.

701
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Like always.

702
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,840
Actually, all this time

703
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
I’ve been trying to help you.

704
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
Since the mafia forced you to pay off that debt,

705
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,480
I was the one who called people to get them arrested.

706
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,360
I bought this apartment room for you.

707
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,120
I told Professor Sarah

708
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
to let me look after you at the university,

709
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,080
tried to find chances to see you,

710
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
joined the short film project

711
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,600
even though

712
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,080
I can’t act at all.

713
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,840
Why are you telling me all this?

714
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,960
From now on…

715
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,760
let me be your boyfriend.

716
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,840
I promise

717
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,520
I’ll make every one of your dreams come true.

718
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,040
Be my boyfriend, Ice.

719
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
No matter if my dad forbids it,

720
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,680
kicks me out,

721
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,040
or locks me up.

722
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,280
I promise,

723
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,800
I swear, I’ll find my way to you.

724
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,440
I’ll protect you,

725
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
no matter what happens.

726
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,440
I love you, Ice.

727
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,560
(I once went through pain.)

728
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,080
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

729
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,840
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

730
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,360
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

731
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,960
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

732
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

733
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,000
(Thank you for coming into my life)

734
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,800
(as a ray of sunshine,)

735
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,400
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

736
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,120
(from once withered to bloom again.)

737
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,280
(Thank you for making everyday)

738
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,240
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

739
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,160
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

740
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

741
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,960
Do you think Saint and Ice are together yet?

742
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Maybe they’re secretly together…

743
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,520
like we were.

744
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,800
I'm just scared that…

745
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,960
even though I already broke up with Saint,

746
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,480
Saint’s father still wouldn’t allow him

747
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,000
to date Ice anyway.

748
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,320
People…

749
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,600
if they really love each other,

750
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,120
no matter how hard it is,

751
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,960
you can’t stop them.

752
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,480
Believe me.

753
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,520
Sure.

754
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,960
Hey guys!

755
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,320
Let’s toast!

756
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,880
Come on, come on! Bottoms up!

757
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,520
Let’s go!

758
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,680
Can you show me first?

759
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,400
Huh?

760
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,160
Show me how you do it.

761
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,040
No problem.

762
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,240
I’ve had three glasses already,

763
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
and I finished all of them.

764
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,440
But you guys haven’t finished any!

765
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,320
Woah!

766
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Book, drink more!

767
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
Getting there! Mud!

768
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,120
You’re drinking way too much.

769
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,160
Just a little bit!

770
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,240
Right, Pas?

771
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,720
Hey.

772
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,320
Right?

773
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,120
Who knows.

774
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,520
Do whatever you want.

775
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,400
Huh?

776
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,640
Okay, that’s enough. Easy stuff.

777
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,280
This is a friend from your faculty?

778
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,560
Ah.

779
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,280
This is my roommate.

780
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,760
Book.

781
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,600
Yep.

782
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,440
Oh.

783
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,000
Ah, nice to meet you, Book.

784
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,560
Same here.

785
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,000
Are you okay?

786
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,760
I..

787
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,120
I’m gonna go to the bathroom for a bit.

788
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,360
Oh, sure.

789
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
(Even if…)

790
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,600
(Even if we can’t be lovers…)

791
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,920
(I’ll still be your fan, Ice. From Pas.)

792
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,560
(Even if we can’t be lovers…)

793
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,160
(I’ll still be your fan, Ice. From Pas.)

794
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,360
Thank you for coming into my life

795
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,200
as a ray of sunshine,

796
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,160
that gives meaning to a sunflower like me

797
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,840
from once withered to bloom again.

798
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,240
Thank you for making everyday

799
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,400
no longer lonely as it once was.

800
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,600
I'll give back with all the love in my heart.

801
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,120
Always Red Sunflower of yours.

802
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:20,600
Hey!

803
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,080
What are you doing?

804
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,640
That tickles.

805
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,200
Day by day you’re getting clingier,

806
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,040
just like a little bear.

807
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,520
Please,

808
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,800
you’re the one who’s clingy,

809
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,280
you little panda cub.

810
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,400
Ice…

811
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,600
I love you.

812
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,960
I liked you ever since

813
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,720
the first moment you stood in front of my house.

814
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,880
I liked you too

815
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,040
ever since you gave me your shoes at the bus stop.

816
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,680
I love you, Saint.

817
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
Goodnight.

818
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,240
Goodnight.

819
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,280
(Thank you for coming into my life)

820
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,760
(as a ray of sunshine,)

821
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,240
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

822
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,920
(from once withered to bloom again.)

823
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,200
(Thank you for making everyday)

824
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,920
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

825
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,760
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

826
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:14,600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

827
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:22,040
(The distance from the sun to a sunflower like me.)

828
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:28,400
(No matter how far, the light will always reach me.)

829
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,520
(And nobody can ever take your place)

830
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,200
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

831
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,480
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

832
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,880
(Thank you for coming into my life)

833
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,480
(as a ray of sunshine,)

834
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

835
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,720
(from once withered to bloom again.)

836
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,480
(Thank you for making everyday)

837
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,840
Now that you're my boyfriend.

838
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,440
Is there anything else you want to do?

839
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,360
You can do anything you want now.

840
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,360
I'm going to hug you

841
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,920
and tell you sweet dreams every night.

842
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,800
When you understand what I'm trying to say?!

843
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,320
I...

844
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,520
You never consider my feelings!

845
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,160
Do you know that?

846
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,120
I think we should spend some time apart

847
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,240
to think our relationship over.

848
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,120
Ten, can I sleep over?

849
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,120
If one day I don't let you hug me.

850
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,200
What would you do?

851
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,760
I've never thought of that day.

852
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,760
You don't want to hold my hand

853
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,880
because you're embarrassed of me around other people?

854
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,920
Forget about other people.

855
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,800
I only care about my boyfriend.

856
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,080
Alex from freshman year.

857
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,960
He has no record of attending any classes,

858
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,520
except for Professor Mint's.

859
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,680
For us to defeat

860
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,520
someone as cautious as him,

861
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,560
we must expose him

862
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,800
without giving him a chance to redeem himself.
