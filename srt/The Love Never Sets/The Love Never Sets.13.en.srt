1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,160
It's all over Ice.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,360
You don't have to have nightmares anymore.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,760
Someone sent this letter to you.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,120
The personal cash check

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,400
I have attached to this letter

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,080
is my apology as university president

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,680
And as a request from me as a father,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,440
stop contacting Saint

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,080
before my son is put in even more danger.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Ice...

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,320
You're choosing him?

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Fine.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,440
I’ll do this for your mother’s sake.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,600
Go wherever you want.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,680
But don’t expect me to help you.

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,840
I won’t give you a single penny.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,200
Wait for me a little longer, I’ll do everything.

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
So that my dad can't do anything to us anymore.

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
Even though

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
even if you’re not yet the billion-baht son-in-law of Saeng Aruna.

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,040
But I’ll make all your dreams come true.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,000
Huh?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,240
What’s wrong with the photo?

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,640
You don’t look handsome.

25
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,480
People will say

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,000
I took unflattering photos of my boyfriend.

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,360
Come here.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,920
Give it to me.

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,640
I’ll help take some for you.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Do you even know how to take photos?

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,800
It’s okay, I’ll teach you.

32
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,880
Here, try this.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,080
Hold it like this.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,479
Like this?

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Just aim right here.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,960
Okay.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
If the background is bright,

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
the photo will be overexposed.

39
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Do you get it?

40
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,400
How is it?

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Let’s do it again.

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,040
I’ll change the pose.

43
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,680
But this time I want a cute pose.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,560
Which pose?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
The bear pose.

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,360
Do I look handsome?

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,320
Well…

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
Yeah, kind of.

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,600
But you’re more handsome.

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,320
See?

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,600
That’s not true.

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,720
You’re more handsome.

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,600
Look at the colors too.

54
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,560
What?

55
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,079
Hey, stop arguing.

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
I’m your tutor, okay?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,079
Such a shame, huh.

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
It’ll only be in bloom for a little while longer.

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,600
Then it’ll wither.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,360
Why are you being dramatic now,

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
you grizzly bear.

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,120
I’ll just grab you with mu claw!

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,360
You have successfully grabbed the doll.

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,160
Please open the lid to retrieve the doll.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,800
Yes.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,720
Where?

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is the little bear in here?

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Hello everyone!

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Welcome to Midnight Sun.

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
This is our final day on set.

71
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,600
It doesn’t mean we’re quitting filmmaking.

72
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,360
It means that

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
we’re about to wrap shooting!

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,840
Yay!

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
Woo!

76
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,480
As of now,

77
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
for anyone who hasn’t booked tickets for the premiere,

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,760
it’s too late.

79
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,040
But that’s okay, you can watch the replay on

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
the iQIYI app.

81
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,240
Please give us lots of support.

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,560
Oh!

83
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh my gosh!

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,159
Support! Woohoo!

85
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,840
I meant the viewers waiting to watch.

86
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Let’s move to another couple.

87
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Here’s the next pair.

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Honestly, this couple didn’t even have to come.

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
But they chose to anyway.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,520
Do you want to be published online?!

91
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh wow, so fierce.

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,400
Hey.

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,480
I’m just teasing.

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,000
Ohhh.

95
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,800
Anyway, we’d like to thank Book,

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,080
the founder of E-Book,

97
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,560
who became successful

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,960
at the youngest age in Thailand.

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
And Mud, your follower as well.

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
Not his follower.

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,040
I’m his boyfriend.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Oh!

103
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Oops.

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,880
Whoa.

105
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
Oh!

106
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,480
Huh?

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,760
If I don’t say it like that, he’ll get mad at me.

108
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,640
Let’s move on to the last couple.

109
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,280
This is the hottest couple right now.

110
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
Ice, the rising star,

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
and Saint, the former billionaire heir,

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,400
who decided to..

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:42,920
Oops!

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,000
Let’s change the topic.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Oh, okay, take two.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,240
Ice and Saint,

117
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,440
the ship everyone is holding their breath for,

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,040
wondering how it’ll end.

119
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
They say

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,360
young puppy boys who are still virgins are..

121
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,720
Very fierce and very possessive of their owners.

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Right?

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,920
I’m not a virgin.

124
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
Oh! Oh!

125
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
He’s not a virgin!

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Woo!

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Wow,

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,280
if the behind-the-scenes is already this intense,

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,840
imagine what it’s like in front of the camera.

130
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
Seriously!

131
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,240
Stay tuned for the next episode of

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,640
Midnight Sun.

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,200
Bye-bye!

134
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Careful.

135
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Let me have a kiss.

136
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
Lanee.

137
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,960
Hmm?

138
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,000
You kiss my cheek every day

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,760
until my cheeks are all wrinkled.

140
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
But your cheeks are so soft.

141
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,960
Like this.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,480
Like this.

143
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,760
Let go or I’ll take my shoe off.

144
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
Can’t you take it off like this?

145
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,159
We’ll fall.

146
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,920
Huh?

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,840
We won’t fall.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Are you sure we won’t fall?

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Let go, hurry.

150
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,400
Ah!

151
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,720
Ah!

152
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Oops.

153
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,040
Are you okay?

154
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,480
I’m fine.

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
Oops.

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
Now I'm kissing you.

157
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,480
We’ll both get wrinkly together until we’re old.

158
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
I thought you were doing something else.

159
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,159
Why did you shower for so long?

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,159
Shaving.

161
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,040
I thought you were secretly jerking off.

162
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,280
I’ll kick you.

163
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,800
Help me out, will you?

164
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,000
I’m really not good at this.

165
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
Sure.

166
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,400
Stay still.

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,080
You’ll bleed.

168
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,560
I’m seriously asking.

169
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Why do you always get horny in the bathroom?

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
People are allowed to have weird preferences, right?

171
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
And when you sleep with me at night,

172
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
don’t you feel anything?

173
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
At night I’m tired.

174
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,720
I use up a lot of energy.

175
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
What’s wrong?

176
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Nothing.

177
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,280
It’s just…

178
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
I think it’s not that late yet.

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
You probably

180
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,920
aren’t tired.

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,720
Not yet.

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
Where is it?

183
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,800
This time,

184
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
I want it on the bed.

185
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,720
Awake already?

186
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Not really.

187
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
How was it just now?

188
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,560
Did it hurt?

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It didn’t hurt,

190
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
just exhausting.

191
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,440
And I’m tired from traveling.

192
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Can I sleep a bit more?

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
Okay,

194
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,280
I’ll go to the bathroom first.

195
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,680
Mm.

196
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,480
Saint.

197
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,760
What time is it?

198
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,800
Almost five.

199
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,080
Don’t we have dinner with your family today?

200
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,720
Oh right.

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,520
Hey, where are my pants?

202
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
Hey, give them back.

203
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,880
Hey!

204
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you doing?

205
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
Another round?

206
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
You’re such a pain.

207
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,840
You’ll get it in a second.

208
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,760
Guess you’re fully awake now.

209
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
Hurry up and wash your face and brush your teeth.

210
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,120
Your family will be waiting.

211
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
Let’s go.

212
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,240
Hey.

213
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Don’t peek.

214
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,400
Just a little.

215
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,400
Why are you smiling so much?

216
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,320
Probably happy

217
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
to be having dinner with your family.

218
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,400
Hey.

219
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,320
Don’t stare at him like that.

220
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,280
You’ll make him shy.

221
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,680
I like Saint.

222
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,560
Saint?

223
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,160
Yes?

224
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
What do you like to eat?

225
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,520
Spring rolls?

226
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
Sure.

227
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,160
Make it a big piece.

228
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
A big one.

229
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,240
Thank you.

230
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
So

231
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,840
when will you invite Saint’s dad

232
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,280
to have dinner with us?

233
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
I want to meet him.

234
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,320
I just got him kicked out of his house.

235
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,280
Oh.

236
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
Fathers can kick their kids out?

237
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
Oh.

238
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll will explain later.

239
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,840
But Dad, don’t kick me out, okay?

240
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,560
I’m trying to prove something to my dad.

241
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,400
That Ice and I

242
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
can be happy together,

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,280
even if it’s not how he planned it.

244
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,200
Mm.

245
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,319
But right now, I’m pretty broke.

246
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,280
I spent all my savings buying Saeng Aruna Wong stocks.

247
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,520
So this meal, thanks to you guys

248
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
it really saved me.

249
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,160
If there’s anything you want me to help with,

250
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,640
just tell me.

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,960
Yes, Mom.

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,680
Mom.

253
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,280
Hmm?

254
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
Please wait a little longer.

255
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,760
I still have a lot to prove to his father.

256
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,800
As for you…

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,320
hang in there for me.

258
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,440
I promise

259
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,320
I’ll make your dream come true.

260
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,640
Just being able to eat with your family like this,

261
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,120
my dream has already come true.

262
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,840
Ice,

263
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
could you give me more rice.

264
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
This one never stops eating.

265
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
Is it good?

266
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Do you need anything else?

267
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,320
Oh.

268
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,040
The rice is almost gone.

269
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,400
Ice, go get some more, dear.

270
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,920
Yes, Mom.

271
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,920
It’s okay, I’ll get it.

272
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,680
Okay.

273
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,160
(1997)

274
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
Ah!

275
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Well?

276
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Has anything improved ever since Seen left?

277
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,640
What are we supposed to do now?

278
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
How are we supposed to live?

279
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
Should I go beg on the streets

280
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,400
so I can feed the two of you?

281
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,160
Never doing anything

282
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,440
other than yelling at his own son!

283
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,480
Stop talking about Narong like that!

284
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
Go upstairs and apologize to him!

285
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,240
Go!

286
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
Go apologize right now!

287
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,040
Go!!

288
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,000
The day Seen left.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,040
I said leave!

290
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,640
That was the day my whole world

291
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,040
Shit! went to hell.

292
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,400
Kit!

293
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
Come back here now!

294
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Come back right now!

295
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,040
Kit!

296
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,080
Everyone in my house

297
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,400
went insane.

298
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,880
Hello?

299
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,920
Uh…

300
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,720
it’s me.

301
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,560
Narong.

302
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
What do you want?

303
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
Calling to borrow money again?

304
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
Wasn’t last time enough?

305
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,760
It's just that...

306
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,920
I’m really desperate right now.

307
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,200
Just one installment, okay?

308
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
Please help me.

309
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
I heard your wife and kid are sick.

310
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,720
Then who’s going to pay me back?

311
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Don’t call me again.

312
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
My wife doesn’t like it.

313
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,560
Aah!

314
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Narong!

315
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
Narong!

316
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,560
Narong!

317
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,160
Narong!

318
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
Why did you do this?

319
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,520
Why did you do this?

320
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Why did you leave me?

321
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,760
I can’t be alone.

322
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,960
Get up.

323
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,360
Narong!

324
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
Get up first.

325
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,480
Get out!

326
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,280
It’s all because of you.

327
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,800
Because of you!

328
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,520
Get out!

329
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,160
I said get out!

330
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,560
I don’t understand.

331
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,920
Why does everyone still blame

332
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
Seen’s return

333
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,080
has brought back bad luck?

334
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,240
It’s almost dark.

335
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
I don’t want to go home yet.

336
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,600
Seen?

337
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,240
Should we run away together?

338
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,000
Wait for me here.

339
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
We're going to start a new life

340
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
in a place where no one knows us.

341
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,160
Kit.

342
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,040
Mom.

343
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Are you going to leave me all alone?

344
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,240
Are you going with...

345
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,240
that filthy thing?

346
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Are you still in contact with him?

347
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,920
Why don't you listen to me, son?

348
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Don't say that, Mom.

349
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,160
He's still part of our family, Mom.

350
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,880
No.

351
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Since he caused his father’s death,

352
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,080
he no longer deserves to be part of this family.

353
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,920
Let me ask you directly.

354
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Between me and him,

355
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
who do you choose?

356
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
Why do I have to choose, Mom?

357
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I just want us to stay together.

358
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,360
If you say that, you’re choosing him, right?

359
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,520
Since I have no one left…

360
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,360
Them..

361
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,840
why should I live?

362
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,000
What am I living for?

363
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
Mom!

364
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,600
I’m going to die.

365
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
I have to die. Mom!

366
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,120
I have to die.

367
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,960
Don't! I have to die.

368
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,520
I have to die. Mom, don’t!

369
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,440
Let go!

370
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,200
I have no one left!

371
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,320
Let go!

372
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,880
Let go!

373
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,920
You chose him.

374
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
Let go!

375
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,320
Let go!

376
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
I’m sorry for being a burden.

377
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,680
From now on, I hope you’ll be very happy.

378
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
In the next life, let’s never meet again.

379
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,720
What happened?

380
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,520
I saw a crazy person wearing a mask,

381
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,880
dancing, then jumping into the water to die.

382
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,440
Seen!

383
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,080
Seen! Hey, calm down.

384
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Hey.

385
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,840
Hey.

386
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,520
Kit! Calm down!

387
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,680
Move, asshole!

388
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,200
Move!

389
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,120
It’s because of all of you!

390
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,480
Made him end up like this!

391
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,800
Get out!

392
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,240
I told you to get out!

393
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,680
Fuck!

394
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,480
LGBTQ+ youth are four times more

395
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,080
likely to contemplate suicide than their peers.

396
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,680
This accounts for 18%

397
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,080
of people with diverse sexual identities.

398
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
The causes include depression,

399
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,760
stress from stigma,

400
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,000
and misunderstanding within society.

401
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,960
Stop stigmatization, stop suicide.

402
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,720
(Inspired by a true story)

403
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,920
(Thipthara Phuthongkham would like to thank TQB)

404
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,600
And that concludes

405
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,280
the student short film Midnight Sun.

406
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,160
I’d like to invite the director, the cast

407
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,480
and crew to come up to the stage.

408
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,480
Woo!

409
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,800
First, I’d like to ask a few questions

410
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,840
to our two lead actors.

411
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,800
Saint,

412
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,760
I heard this is your first time acting in a film,

413
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,720
and the role you played is

414
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,680
very different from who you are.

415
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
Was it difficult?

416
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,600
Honestly,

417
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
it was quite challenging.

418
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,920
It took some time for me to tune into the character.

419
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,200
But if I had to say what was the hardest part,

420
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,360
it would probably be…

421
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
the chemistry between the two of us.

422
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,560
That was the hardest.

423
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,600
Next, may I ask Ice a question?

424
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,920
Of course.

425
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,320
Was there any scene that really made

426
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,120
you feel emotionally immersed?

427
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I feel like...

428
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,720
The scene that felt the hardest and most intense for me

429
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,200
was probably the scene where Seen commits suicide.

430
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That scene had a very strong impact.

431
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,400
Yes.

432
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,720
Because…

433
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,880
maybe it’s because I personally relate to it.

434
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
Ice, you’re very strong

435
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,160
for having gone through those experiences.

436
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,480
Now for the final question.

437
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,760
I heard that during filming,

438
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,480
the actors weren’t told in advance

439
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,880
how the ending would turn out.

440
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,880
Could you tell us more about that?

441
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,600
I can answer that.

442
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,120
Sea said that

443
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,240
we used this technique

444
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
so that the emotions expressed

445
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
would align most closely with Kit’s feelings,

446
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,440
not just the perspective of an actor who knows everything.

447
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,960
At that time, I thought

448
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
Seen would be waiting for me by the sea.

449
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,160
But in the end,

450
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,840
he wasn’t there.

451
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
It reminded me of a time

452
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
when I wanted to go out and find someone

453
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,000
I loved very much,

454
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,560
but in the end,

455
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,560
I didn’t go.

456
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,000
I think

457
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
if I hadn’t gone to help them that day,

458
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
I would have regretted it deeply.

459
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Let’s give them a round of applause.

460
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,480
Lastly, I’d like to ask the director

461
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
if there’s anything you’d like to say.

462
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,320
Well, honestly,

463
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,560
the film has already said everything.

464
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,680
But what I want to say is

465
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
thank you so much to everyone.

466
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,360
Thank you, Saint.

467
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,719
It feels like destiny that Saint got to act with Ice.

468
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,199
I’m happy we became close.

469
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,080
Thank you, Ice,

470
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,440
a person I love dearly.

471
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,880
And finally,

472
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,040
the person I want to thank the most is

473
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,639
Lanee.

474
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
Not only as an executive producer,

475
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
but you are is everything to me.

476
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,320
Without you, I don’t know

477
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,080
if this film would have turned out this perfect.

478
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I love Sea's film.

479
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Hello. Hello.

480
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
Hello, Auntie.

481
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,520
You're so talented.

482
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,360
How was it?

483
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
I’ll be right back, dear.

484
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,640
I’ll be back in a moment.

485
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,640
Hello.

486
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,360
Hello.

487
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,560
You’re Mr.Khom, right?

488
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,360
Yes.

489
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I’m…

490
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
my name is Kaew, I’m Ice’s mother.

491
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,040
Yes.

492
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,240
Aren’t you going inside?

493
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
It’s okay.

494
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,040
I just stopped by to watch.

495
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,240
I’ll be leaving soon.

496
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh.

497
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,080
The kids are really talented.

498
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,480
They’ve come this far without any help from us.

499
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,600
As a mother,

500
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,160
I feel…

501
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,360
very guilty.

502
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,320
I wish I could have helped them more.

503
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,080
If I could turn back time,

504
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,040
I would find a way

505
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,360
to stay and watch my children grow up longer.

506
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,280
You shouldn’t wait until it’s too late, Mr.Khom.

507
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,920
I’ll excuse myself now.

508
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Goodbye.

509
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,760
(New-generation music label)

510
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,920
(To support the dreams of people with a past)

511
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Right now, Lanee, Book, and I together

512
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,880
hold 40% of the shares.

513
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,440
If I get 10% from Dad,

514
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,080
that means I’ll become the largest shareholder.

515
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,760
And we’ll change Saeng Aruna Wong Group

516
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,280
into SLI Group.

517
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,240
SLI Group, a new-generation music label,

518
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,520
to support the dreams of people with a past.

519
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,320
The proposal is fucking cool.

520
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,200
We’re not just doing music.

521
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,640
We also plan to make films.

522
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,960
For the film division,

523
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,680
Sea and I will manage it together.

524
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
So the missing 10%

525
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
has to come from Saint’s dad alone, right?

526
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Can’t we get shares from other shareholders?

527
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,240
Getting shares from Mr.Khom

528
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,960
is the best and easiest option.

529
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,760
If Mr.Khom transfers them to Saint,

530
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
he won’t need approval from anyone.

531
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,520
That’s true.

532
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,880
I plan to find a chance to talk to him

533
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,480
after the university countdown event.

534
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Speaking of the university countdown,

535
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,680
I’ve already prepared all the media

536
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,120
that will come to promote and cover it.

537
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Our stance is clear now.

538
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,760
All that’s left is our label’s debut project,

539
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,600
which will use the university countdown

540
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,400
as the first stage to introduce Ice.

541
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,480
We’ll have to see how it goes.

542
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,840
I believe Dad will see that

543
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,240
we do have a good future.

544
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,960
And now, the performance by our talented artist,

545
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,080
Ice Karun Thongdee, will begin in just a few minutes.

546
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,400
Is everyone excited?

547
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
Woo!

548
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,800
What?

549
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,520
Are you excited?

550
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,600
Everyone, do exactly what we practiced.

551
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,960
Give it your all.

552
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,600
Three, four, Red Sunflower together.

553
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,520
Got it. Sure.

554
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,160
Let’s go.

555
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,880
Three, four.

556
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,320
Red Sunflower!

557
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,280
Ten?

558
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,840
What’s wrong with you?

559
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,240
I just want to know how many minutes left.

560
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,880
How many minutes?

561
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,560
How many?

562
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
Two minutes.

563
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,760
Why?

564
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
Two minutes isn’t enough.

565
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,440
It’s here already.

566
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,040
What’s here?

567
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
It’s right at the entrance already, everyone.

568
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,240
Slippery chunks.

569
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,920
Slippery chunks.

570
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,760
Ugh.

571
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,720
I don’t know what this is anymore,

572
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,440
I can’t wait,

573
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,240
I’m going.

574
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,360
Ten!

575
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,160
Shit!

576
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:52,920
What the hell?

577
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,280
What should we do?

578
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,880
If we think positively,

579
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
he might make it back in time.

580
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,360
From the look of it,

581
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,240
there’s no way it’s getting out of his intestines

582
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,760
within two minutes.

583
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,160
Can we delay the performance just a little.

584
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,800
I don’t think that’s possible.

585
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,800
Huh?

586
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,320
We have to perform before

587
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,680
the New Year countdown.

588
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,640
What’s going on?

589
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,560
Ten has explosive diarrhea.

590
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,200
He probably won’t make it on stage in time.

591
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,360
All the musicians are standing by backstage already.

592
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Can we do a sound check one more time?

593
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:31,040
Woo!

594
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,040
How about we cut the electric guitar?

595
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Then there won’t be a solo section.

596
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,120
But we don’t have a choice.

597
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,920
And now, if everyone is ready,

598
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,080
please give a big round of applause for Ice’s band

599
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,960
with the song Red Sunflower.

600
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,080
Let’s go with that.

601
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
Three people is fine.

602
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,440
Go.

603
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,440
Let’s go.

604
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,360
Hello everyone.

605
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,360
My name is Ice.

606
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,800
I never imagined

607
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
I would get to see something like this in front of me.

608
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,760
Thank you all so much.

609
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,160
(I once went through pain.)

610
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,360
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

611
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,400
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

612
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,560
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

613
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,400
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

614
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,200
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

615
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,240
(And nobody can ever take your place)

616
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,520
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

617
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,080
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

618
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,360
(Thank you for coming into my life)

619
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,120
(as a ray of sunshine,)

620
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

621
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,480
(from once withered to bloom again.)

622
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,560
(Thank you for making everyday)

623
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,440
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

624
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,240
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

625
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,960
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

626
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Before the final hook ends,

627
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I’d like to say something first.

628
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,640
Today,

629
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
I want to give credit

630
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,520
to the person who helped me write this song.

631
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,160
At first,

632
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,200
the two of us planned to keep this a secret.

633
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,720
But today…

634
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
I’m ready to say it out loud.

635
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,640
That…

636
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Saint is the co-writer of this song.

637
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,440
Woo! (Fighting!)

638
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,000
Can I hear it for Saint?

639
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,240
Woo!

640
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,280
Woo! (Fighting!)

641
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,040
And

642
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,840
this is also my inspiration for writing the song.

643
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,480
When we were working on it,

644
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,240
someone once said that

645
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,480
sometimes a song about a secret crush

646
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
doesn’t have to be a happy-ending song,

647
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,720
because not everyone

648
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,960
we like will like us back.

649
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,280
But thank you, Ice,

650
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
for turning your song

651
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,440
into a song with a happy ending.

652
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,560
It’s not just my song.

653
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,560
It’s our song.

654
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,480
(Thank you for coming into my life)

655
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,240
(as a ray of sunshine,)

656
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,720
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

657
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,520
(from once withered to bloom again.)

658
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,480
(Thank you for making everyday)

659
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,400
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

660
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,240
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

661
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,720
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

662
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,520
Woo!

663
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I can't take it anymore!

664
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Bye!!

665
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
Since when can you play electric guitar like that?

666
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,560
I’ve got a lot more surprises for you.

667
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,440
Hey,

668
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,880
let me ask you something.

669
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,560
If back then…

670
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,160
I hadn’t chosen you to play together,

671
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,520
or if I hadn’t agreed to be your roommate,

672
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,440
do you think we’d still end up like this today?

673
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,880
I don’t know.

674
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,400
But I think…

675
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,440
I’d find my way back into your life anyway.

676
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,120
Even though you knew

677
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,400
I’d probably kick you out?

678
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,840
Mm.

679
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,000
But still…

680
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,640
At least one thing is obvious, right?

681
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
I acted best in that scene.

682
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,920
How do you know?

683
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,040
Wanna do another casting round?

684
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,200
Seen.

685
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,520
Can I do the scene where I kiss you?

686
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,800
You like me, don’t you?

687
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,000
If I ask, you have to answer.

688
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,960
So how was the casting result?

689
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,480
Passed, obviously.

690
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,680
I mean…

691
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,960
That scene had to be you, right?

692
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
In front of shrine?

693
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,000
They might be watching.

694
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
But I think…

695
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
The gods are probably on our side.

696
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,640
Hello, Aunt Bua.

697
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,560
Hello, Saint and Ice.

698
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,520
You’re early today.

699
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,120
How have you been, Aunt Bua?

700
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,200
I’m doing well.

701
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,480
Please come this way.

702
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,560
Aren’t we going inside?

703
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
The Master asked you to wait here first.

704
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,280
Aunt Bua,

705
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,200
since when did Dad start planting these flowers?

706
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,880
Or is he just messing with me?

707
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,760
Why don’t you try asking

708
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,960
Mr.Khom yourself, Saint?

709
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,800
Do you like these sunflowers?

710
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,720
Sorry?

711
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,280
At first, I planned to replant the red sunflowers.

712
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,160
But once I actually tried,

713
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,480
I realized that red sunflowers

714
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,480
are really hard to find.

715
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:35,360
No wonder you two love them so much.

716
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,200
Alright.

717
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Let’s get straight to the point.

718
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
You probably know

719
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
why I called you here.

720
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,480
To be honest,

721
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,400
I really have no idea, sir.

722
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Are you serious about Saint?

723
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,160
Yes.

724
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,840
No matter what happens,

725
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,640
you won’t leave him,

726
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,320
you won’t make him sad.

727
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,440
Yes.

728
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,120
No matter if he’s sick or poor,

729
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,000
or in another ten years,

730
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,800
when he’s old and completely useless,

731
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,800
I still won’t leave him.

732
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,120
But right now, I am poor though.

733
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,280
I heard you went around buying up company shares.

734
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,400
Is that true?

735
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,520
Yes.

736
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,320
As for the remaining ten percent of the shares,

737
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,040
I’ve decided

738
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,280
to give them to you.

739
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,360
From now on,

740
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
you’ll be the major shareholder

741
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,160
of Saeng Aruna Wong Group.

742
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,200
As for you,

743
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,200
I’m sorry,

744
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,560
I scolded you a lot before.

745
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,560
I had Benz take photos of you two

746
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,240
because I wanted to know

747
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
how you were doing

748
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,120
after you left the house.

749
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,760
I tried going to therapy.

750
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,000
That’s when I realized

751
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,520
that I was actually

752
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,600
the one who was abnormal.

753
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,920
You know, Saint,

754
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,920
when I tried

755
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,200
music therapy,

756
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,920
the sound I heard,

757
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,960
the sound of my hand hitting the drum,

758
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,640
was the same sound

759
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,400
as when I slapped you.

760
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,840
I’m sorry, Saint,

761
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,040
for filling our memories

762
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,760
with nothing but bad things.

763
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,520
Everyone has gone through bad times.

764
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,680
Please don’t blame yourself, sir.

765
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,360
This might sound selfish,

766
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,280
but if you don’t mind an old man

767
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,080
with a wicked heart like me,

768
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,200
this house is always open

769
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,080
for you to come back and live here together.

770
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,680
Alright?

771
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,280
Saint,

772
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,760
you know this, right?

773
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,600
This house has always been in your name.

774
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
All this time,

775
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,840
he has been like the sunflowers in the garden.

776
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,360
Whenever someone rang the doorbell,

777
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,480
he’d always look out, every single day,

778
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,000
waiting for the day you’d come home.

779
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,200
Saint.

780
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,320
I missed you too.

781
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,080
I'm sorry.

782
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,440
I miss you.

783
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,440
One.

784
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,160
Two.

785
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:47,880
Three.

786
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,240
Yay!

787
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
The shop is open!

788
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:51,920
We’re open!

789
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,280
Hurry up!

790
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:53,880
They’re here!

791
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,120
They’re here now!

792
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,160
Saint and Ice’s photobook,

793
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,000
with exclusive behind-the-scenes content,

794
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,640
from the two of us and Benz.

795
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,920
Besides those,

796
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,640
there’s also a lot of merchandise.

797
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,760
Come pick yours first!

798
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,000
You can scan here.

799
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,360
Scan right here.

800
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
This one?

801
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,040
Scan over here. That one?

802
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,800
Ah, the car’s here!

803
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,600
Hey!

804
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,680
Everyone, please stay calm!

805
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,840
Not yet, please!

806
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,320
Calm down!

807
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,800
Move aside.

808
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,560
What do you mean?

809
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,880
It’s me, you idiot.

810
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,040
Oh.

811
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,240
Is there ever going to be a first day of school

812
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,640
that's not hectic?

813
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,160
Ice, can I take a selfie with you?

814
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,760
I really like you.

815
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
Woo!

816
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
Could you tone it down a bit?

817
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,320
See, his partner is standing right there watching.

818
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,640
Uh…

819
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,800
Sorry.

820
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,600
Sorry, I’m just kidding.

821
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
I’ll take the photo for you.

822
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,720
Thank you.

823
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,480
Hey, did you hear

824
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,800
they’ve known each other since they were kids?

825
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,080
They’re such a perfect match.

826
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,600
For real.

827
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,880
Saint, the president of SLI Group,

828
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,360
and Ice, the rising male artist.

829
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,760
And Ice even tutored Saint

830
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,520
until he got into university.

831
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,680
Oh my god!

832
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,040
That’s amazing.

833
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,960
So cute.

834
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,400
A perfect golden couple.

835
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,280
They call that qīng méi zhú mǎ.

836
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,040
I’ll excuse myself now.

837
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,400
Please make way.

838
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
Excuse me.

839
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,960
(High-Security Prison Café)

840
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
How does it feel

841
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,560
to see so much attention on SLI Group?

842
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,000
I’m really happy that SLI Group

843
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,200
has finally launched officially.

844
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,760
Yes.

845
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,400
And now that you’ve debuted Ice Karun Thongdee

846
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,800
as your first artist,

847
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,480
can you tell us

848
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,800
if there are plans for a second artist yet?

849
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,720
Yes, there is.

850
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,200
Ice personally picked

851
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,720
and is grooming this one himself.

852
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,200
Can you give us a hint who it is?

853
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,320
How do you sell the coffee?

854
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,640
How have you been?

855
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,720
Just like you see.

856
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,560
I’m like any other inmate.

857
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,200
Are you training for a job at the café?

858
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,160
Yeah.

859
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:34,840
Oh.

860
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,640
This is probably what I like most.

861
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,920
I want to apologize to you, Ice.

862
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,720
For losing control

863
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,640
and doing terrible things back then.

864
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,560
At the time, I only thought about

865
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,840
wanting to feel like I’d won.

866
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,480
It was really stupid.

867
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,360
Since when did you start doing drugs?

868
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,200
Why?

869
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,640
I never knew.

870
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
I use it when I’m stressed.

871
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,360
Sometimes I don’t know

872
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
who to talk to.

873
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,960
Warm.

874
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,200
Actually, I wasn’t a good partner either.

875
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,680
I’m sorry.

876
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,280
But you know, right, Warm,

877
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,240
that you really were my warmth once.

878
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,040
I just want to tell you that

879
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
I forgive you now.

880
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,760
And I hope

881
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,640
you can forgive me too.

882
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah.

883
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,120
I’m sorry too.

884
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,360
Yeah.

885
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,640
So…

886
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,320
have you thought

887
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,480
about what you’ll do after you get out?

888
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,760
Do you still want to be a singer?

889
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
No one’s going to give me a chance.

890
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,040
Hey.

891
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,520
But don’t pity me.

892
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,320
This is what I deserve.

893
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,080
Opportunities

894
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,200
come from not repeating your mistakes.

895
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,000
Then come stay with us.

896
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,760
Saint, our friends, and I

897
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
started a company together.

898
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,080
Huh?

899
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,360
Just like you saw in the news.

900
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,920
SLI Group is a music label

901
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,640
created to support people

902
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,800
with dreams who have a past.

903
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,080
What do you mean?

904
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,800
It means if you truly change,

905
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,920
don’t be afraid that

906
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,160
no one will give you a chance.

907
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,120
We’re ready to give you one to

908
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,480
become a singer.

909
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,920
When you get out,

910
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,840
if the song’s ready,

911
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,400
don’t forget to audition at my label.

912
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,720
Yeah.

913
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,560
If you’re brave, then hit me.

914
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,600
I'm kicking you out!

915
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,560
If you’re brave.

916
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,800
I’m not scared.

917
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,280
I can be scared.

918
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,080
Come!

919
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,640
If you’re brave, hit me.

920
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,200
Go ahead and try.

921
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,560
Charge!

922
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,400
Yay, I won!

923
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,920
This place is really nice.

924
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,920
It’s beautiful and peaceful.

925
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,720
Then come visit often.

926
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,400
Now that we’re family,

927
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,720
just message me anytime.

928
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Everyone,

929
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,200
let’s take a photo together.

930
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,440
Make me look handsome, Saint.

931
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,440
Of course.

932
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,160
Hurry.

933
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,440
Come on, Dad.

934
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,440
Go! Come on.

935
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,120
You should join too, Dad.

936
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,480
How can a family photo not include you?

937
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,960
Come on, Dad.

938
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,240
Stand right here.

939
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,720
Uncle, smile big.

940
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,240
Family photos need big smiles.

941
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,360
Alright.

942
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,200
Here we go.

943
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I’m exhausted.

944
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,720
Let me eat something.

945
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,520
Can I take a photo?

946
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,160
Sure.
