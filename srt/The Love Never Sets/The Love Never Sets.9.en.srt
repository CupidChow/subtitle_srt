1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you think Saint and Book, like each other?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,600
I didn’t want you to be angry.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,360
But I had to distance myself because…

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,360
My dad told Benz to keep an eye on me.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Then why were you flirting with Book?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,360
I’ve always been clear.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,920
About who I want to be with.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
We want both of you

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
to be a couple for one day.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Be my boyfriend for one day?

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,320
My bear?

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,760
Don’t move so much.

13
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,120
What are you supposed to call me?

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,080
Call me Little Bear.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
Are you serious?

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, creepy.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,759
If you don’t call me that,

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,920
I’ll tell Sea.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,039
Annoying.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
So,

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,360
what about tomorrow?

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
Where are we going on our date?

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
Don’t worry about that,Panda.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
Little Bear has it all planned out.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,800
Tomorrow,

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
make sure you wake up on time.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,720
Five a.m.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Huh,

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,720
five a.m.?!

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
I’m not going with you.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Who goes on a crazy date at five a.m.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
Go alone then.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,240
I’m not going.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
But Sea said so.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,640
Or if you're not going to do it.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,160
I’ll handle Sea.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
but I’m not going on the date.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who goes at five a.m. anyway.

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,920
Well…

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
I’ll wake you up.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
I’ll wake you.

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,320
Go ahead.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,600
I’ll wake you.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,680
I’m not going.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,600
Are you trying to force me.

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,440
Huh.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
We’re a couple.

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,920
How is it forcing?

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,600
Ouch.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
It hasn’t even started yet!

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,720
Goodnight, Panda.

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,800
Morning.

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,159
Not yet.

54
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,720
I want to sleep some more.

55
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,120
Wake up.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,000
Wake up.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Wake up, we got to go.

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Wake up, it's already late.

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Just a little more.

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,560
Are you getting up or not?

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,360
No.

62
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,000
Fine.

63
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Wake up.

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Get up already, come here.

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,000
Wake up.

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,920
Get up, you’re late.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,560
Hurry.

68
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,320
Hurry.

69
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,600
Hey.

70
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,240
Saint.

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Hurry up.

72
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,400
No.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
I’m not getting up.

74
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Saint!.

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,520
I’m awake, I’m awake.

76
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Let go of me.

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, okay.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
I’m letting go.

79
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,080
You’re heavier than I thought.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,440
You don’t have to do all this, you know.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,280
No.

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Since I’m doing it,

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
I have to make it realistic.

84
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Like when Kit and Seen go on dates.

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,200
Like how?

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey.

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,160
What are you doing?

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,880
Brushing your teeth.

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
Hey, I can do it myself.

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Well, before this you didn't have me.

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,200
Here.

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
No need.

93
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
Wash your face.

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,600
You’re starting to do more than

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
what Sea ordered you to.

96
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,080
No I’m not.

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,320
Even if she didn’t tell me to.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
I still want to do it.

99
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,840
(I once went through pain.)

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,320
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

101
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,840
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

102
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,800
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,760
Here.

104
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,080
What?

105
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Wear this.

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,440
No.

107
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,800
Fine.

108
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
What are you doing?

109
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Why aren't you wearing it?

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm going on a date with you like this.

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,520
Whatever.

112
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,640
Hey.

113
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,600
What do you mean whatever?

114
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,520
Hey. What?

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,800
Are you going to wear it? Saint.

116
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Ow. Oh.

117
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,720
No.

118
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Are you going to wear it?

119
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,040
No.

120
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Why would I wear it?

121
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
Then we'll stay like this.

122
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,200
If I had a boyfriend,

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,320
I'd lay around hugging him like this all day.

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,080
Uh... Fine.

125
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll wear it.

126
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
(Thank you for coming into my life)

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
(as a ray of sunshine,)

128
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,520
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

129
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,000
(from once withered to bloom again.)

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,200
(Thank you for making everyday)

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,840
Hey!

132
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,040
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

133
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,840
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,760
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,160
(The distance from the sun to a sunflower like me.)

136
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
(No matter how far,)

137
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,400
(the light will always reach me.)

138
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,280
(And nobody can ever take your place)

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,680
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

140
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,400
Have some.

141
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,520
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

142
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,440
(Thank you for coming into my life)

143
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm a great boyfriend, right?

144
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,040
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
(from once withered to bloom again.)

146
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
(Thank you for making everyday)

147
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,720
Hey.

148
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,280
What are you doing?

149
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,680
No.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
We're..

151
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
We're on a date as a couple?

152
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,440
Ah.

153
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
(Thank you for coming into my life)

154
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,480
(as a ray of sunshine,)

155
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,280
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

156
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,320
(from once withered to bloom again.)

157
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
(Thank you for making everyday)

158
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,840
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,640
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

160
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
We could enter a Loy Krathong contest

162
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,040
dressed like this.

163
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
We look like characters from classic literature,

164
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,640
right?

165
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,280
Yeah.

166
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,800
Am I pretty?

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,040
Pretty.

168
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,840
What was that?

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,440
Very pretty.

170
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
Lanee is really pretty today.

171
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
When you compliment me like that…

172
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
I get shy, you know.

173
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,880
Do I really have to dance?

174
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,800
What?

175
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,760
Well,

176
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,520
I saw they needed it for the workshop.

177
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,680
So I went to find it for you.

178
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,600
Mm.

179
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,960
I'll teach you.

180
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
First move, okay.

181
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,080
This is me.

182
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Okay again.

183
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,680
Me.

184
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,240
Come on.

185
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Me, like this. No.

186
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,320
Me.

187
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,480
Please?

188
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,040
Me.

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,720
I’m happy.

190
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,480
I’m happy.

191
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm so happy to be here with you.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
You’re really over the top.

193
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Hey, it’s so you can use it in the workshop.

194
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Isn’t that good?

195
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
It is.

196
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Then…

197
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,800
What does this one mean.

198
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,720
Watch.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
Where.

200
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,080
I.

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,400
Love.

202
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,000
You.

203
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,320
I love you?

204
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,360
Mm.

205
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Are you saying you love me?

206
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
If you already knew the dance moves,

207
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,440
you should have told me first.

208
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
I wanted you to teach me, it’s cute.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Then I’m going to be mad at you now.

210
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,880
Oh, let me make it up to you.

211
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,640
Can I?

212
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,800
Can I?

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Fine.

214
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
You dance well.

215
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,000
You’re pretty.

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,480
You don’t need to be an executive producer anymore.

217
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Go act as Scene instead of Ice?

218
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,760
Seriously?

219
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,280
I'll do it.

220
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,080
We’ll fire Ice tomorrow.

221
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
But you have to say it yourself.

222
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
I’m not getting involved.

223
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Huh, you’re the director?

224
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,800
You have to talk to him.

225
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,600
But there’s one thing I want to be more.

226
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
What is it?

227
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,120
Your girlfriend.

228
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,720
Lanee?

229
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,960
Be with me.

230
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,920
I know you feel the same.

231
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
From now on

232
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
don’t be cute with anyone else.

233
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,280
And don’t do the pouty face for anyone either.

234
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Okay?

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,280
Okay, my girlfriend.~

236
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay.

237
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I have a girlfriend now.

238
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
Let’s take a photo.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
Oh. Okay.

240
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,920
Cute pose.

241
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,200
Cute pose, okay. One.

242
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,600
Two.

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,160
Three.

244
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
One.

245
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,200
Two.

246
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,120
Three.

247
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,600
Ready.

248
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,120
Three.

249
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,720
Two.

250
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,240
I’ll get it for you.

251
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,480
Here.

252
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,000
Hey,

253
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,760
this looks nice.

254
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,080
You can custom order it.

255
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,360
One of a kind.

256
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,720
Yeah.

257
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,640
How much is it.

258
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,640
Only twelve thousand.

259
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,280
Want it?

260
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,120
I’ll engrave your name too.

261
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,960
What design?

262
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,560
Uh…

263
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
No thanks.

264
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,520
Oh, Saint.

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,000
There you are.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,200
I finally found someone I feel comfortable with.

267
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,440
Not like someone else…

268
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
Being around them is suffocating as hell.

269
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,840
Yeah right.

270
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,720
I’m not handsome and kind…

271
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,280
Comfortable like your other friend.

272
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,920
Saint.

273
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,320
Come hang out with me today.

274
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,360
He's driving me crazy.

275
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Hey,

276
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,880
how long are you two gonna talk?

277
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,280
We came as four and you’re only talking to each other.

278
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,160
Saint.

279
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,119
Come look at tie-dye with me.

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,079
Ice.

281
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Do you know when I was just with him just now.

282
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,720
He didn’t talk to me at all!

283
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,960
So suffocating.

284
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
Calm down.

285
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,120
Are you fighting with Book or what.

286
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
The other day I asked him about Saint.

287
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,800
He said I was toxic and talking badly to him.

288
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,360
He said I’m not like Saint…

289
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,040
Who makes him feel comfortable.

290
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,400
Book said that.

291
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Yeah.

292
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,280
I swear those two must like each other.

293
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,560
Shit.

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,080
What do I do.

295
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Wait…

296
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,440
Are you

297
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
jealous of Book?

298
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,680
Huh.

299
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
What do you mean jealous?

300
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,400
Huh?

301
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,680
If you’re not jealous,

302
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,120
why are you stressed like this?

303
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
Ice, stop saying dumb shit.

304
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,000
See?

305
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,600
I don’t know if Saint and Book like each other.

306
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
But you…

307
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,040
You one hundred percent like Book.

308
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,000
Fuck that!

309
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,960
Mm.

310
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,240
I just want to know

311
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,600
if Saint and Book really like each other.

312
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,000
I…

313
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,880
I just want to be nosy.

314
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,520
Did Saint ever say anything to you about Book?

315
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,880
Like hinting,

316
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,440
bringing him up, something like that.

317
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,200
I don’t know.

318
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
But I’m sure they like each other.

319
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm sure about it

320
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,440
Try thinking if he ever mentioned Book?

321
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,360
I said I don’t know.

322
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
If you want to know, just ask him.

323
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,080
Huh?

324
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,160
Hey, wait for me.

325
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
Mine turned out so nice.

326
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,120
Right.

327
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,040
Yeah,

328
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,360
you're so talented.

329
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,320
Teach me.

330
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,360
I still can’t tie it.

331
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,280
Just keep doing it.

332
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,120
Come, I’ll do it for you.

333
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,920
No.

334
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,000
What.

335
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
Why can’t I help.

336
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,360
You’re annoying.

337
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,360
Don’t bother me.

338
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
Why do you hate me so much.

339
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
I don’t hate you,

340
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,040
it’s just my shirt.

341
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
I can do it myself.

342
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
No, I’ll do it.

343
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,560
No.

344
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,840
Let go.

345
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,440
I’ll do it myself.

346
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,720
Let go.

347
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,440
I’ll do it myself.

348
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,240
I said let go.

349
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,080
Let go.

350
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,760
Give it.

351
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,520
I said let go.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,120
Let go.

353
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,640
Ow.

354
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,360
Hey.

355
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,400
Are you okay. Shit.

356
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
I said let go.

357
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,640
See? It’s all stained now.

358
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,280
I’m sorry, Book.

359
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,160
I didn’t mean to.

360
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,800
Come here.

361
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,480
Where are we going?

362
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,000
Come on.

363
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
(Natural dye tie-dye cloth,)

364
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,560
(community agricultural enterprise.)

365
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,360
Shit.

366
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,160
It won’t come out.

367
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,400
You!

368
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,680
Forget it.

369
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,560
No.

370
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,960
I’ve done a lot of wrong things to you.

371
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,480
I don’t want to be a shitty friend in your eyes.

372
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I want to be a good friend in your eyes too.

373
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,480
If it won’t come off then it won’t come off.

374
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,760
Give me back the shirt.

375
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,680
Do you like Saint or what?

376
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,520
Huh?

377
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
I’m asking you, so answer.

378
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,480
I’m leaving.

379
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Answer me first.

380
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Let me go.

381
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,560
Answer me first!

382
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,840
Why do you want to know?

383
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,600
Do you like me?

384
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah!

385
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,760
Do you even realize what you just said?

386
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,600
I like you.

387
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,560
I’m not okay

388
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,160
when you spend a long time with someone else.

389
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,560
Like when you’re with Saint.

390
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,800
I’m sorry I freaked out on you the whole week.

391
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,000
But everything I did…

392
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,040
I realized I like you.

393
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,160
Can you like me back?

394
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
From now on

395
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
don’t go liking anyone else anymore.

396
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,080
Can I be the one

397
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,560
who gets to fall asleep hugging you every day?

398
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,200
Not just as a friend.

399
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
I like you.

400
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Do you like me?

401
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,080
Come here, I’ll help.

402
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,160
What’s wrong?

403
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,800
I have a question I want to ask.

404
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,880
But I don’t have to ask.

405
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,920
But I also don’t want it to keep bothering me.

406
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
Then just ask.

407
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,560
If I can answer, I will.

408
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,520
About the red sunflower.

409
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,840
You used it to flirt with Book, right?

410
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,600
No.

411
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
And Book likes sunflowers so much…

412
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
He even hung them in his room.

413
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
So you two really liked each other, right.

414
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,880
About that?

415
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,240
That picture was

416
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,840
the cover photo for a column.

417
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
That he wrote for me.

418
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,160
He said

419
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,320
he liked when

420
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,000
someone had feelings for the one they love.

421
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Like the meaning of that flower.

422
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,720
Midnight Sunflower.

423
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,240
A flower that blooms

424
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,040
even in the darkest times.

425
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Like a love that stays beautiful…

426
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
Even in the deepest night.

427
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,240
No matter how far apart two people are…

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
The love they once had…

429
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
It never changes.

430
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,920
(Thank you for coming into my life)

431
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,200
(as a ray of sunshine,)

432
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,760
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

433
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,840
(from once withered to bloom again.)

434
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
A love that remains beautiful

435
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,840
even in the darkness.

436
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,760
Is the meaning of the flower called…

437
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,240
Midnight Sunflower.

438
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,080
How did you know that?

439
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,600
Didn’t you say you like this flower.

440
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,160
You remembered?

441
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,480
You also read this magazine?

442
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,360
Yeah.

443
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
I once wrote a letter to someone.

444
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
Through a column in that magazine.

445
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Same for me.

446
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Full Moon Night

447
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,600
and Mr. Sunshine.

448
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,040
Wait.

449
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Good night,

450
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
I hope we meet again tomorrow.

451
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,440
You..

452
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
You were the one who sent letters to me.

453
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,720
When I was in therapy for gender dysphoria?

454
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,200
Yeah.

455
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,720
What a crazy coincidence.

456
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,760
Do you know…

457
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
Your letters…

458
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
They meant everything to me.

459
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,440
Back then I didn’t want to live anymore.

460
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
I didn’t even

461
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
want to open my eyes to breathe.

462
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
My whole world was dark.

463
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
But because of your letters…

464
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I wanted to stay alive.

465
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,880
I’m…

466
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Happy.

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So happy.

468
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,200
Thank you.

469
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,200
Come on.

470
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Let’s play in the water.

471
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,360
No, I don’t want to get wet.

472
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,480
Hey.

473
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,320
Don’t.

474
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,040
I’ll get wet.

475
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,160
Come on, let’s play in the water.

476
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,360
No, I’ll get wet.

477
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Hey.

478
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Isn't he afraid of getting AIDS or what?

479
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, since when did they get so close?

480
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,840
Ugh,

481
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
gross!

482
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,200
(I.)

483
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
(I love.)

484
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,000
(I love you.)

485
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,680
(What about you?)

486
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,320
(I.)

487
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
(I love.)

488
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,160
(I love you.)

489
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
So beautiful.

490
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,160
What is it?

491
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Do you know Li Bai?

492
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,280
He’s the poet who rowed out to catch the moon.

493
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Li Bai rowed out

494
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,240
and saw the reflection of the moon on the water.

495
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,640
Sparkling.

496
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,800
So he wanted to possess the moon.

497
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,720
And he jumped into the water to grab it.

498
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,120
In the end he died.

499
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
Because in reality…

500
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
The moon is in the sky,

501
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,480
not the reflection in the water.

502
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,040
Who would be stupid enough to

503
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,520
reach for the moon in the water and die.

504
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,960
Only drunk people.

505
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,760
You don’t understand the beauty of the story at all.

506
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,360
It’s because

507
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Li Bai loved the moon so much.

508
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,080
Even if he couldn’t have it…

509
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,320
At least

510
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,280
he tried.

511
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,080
People who give

512
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
everything for what they believe in…

513
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
It’s romantic.

514
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Well then…

515
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I’ll take good care of it.

516
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Thank you.

517
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,639
Hey.

518
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,320
Are you messing with me?

519
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,320
How?

520
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
When you hang clothes you have to shake them.

521
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,400
Hey.

522
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,719
Getting revenge?

523
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,080
So you want to do this?

524
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,960
Fine.

525
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,240
Where are you going!

526
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,160
Come here!

527
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,840
Mom.

528
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,480
Don’t.

529
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
Don’t, don’t.

530
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,120
I’ve wanted to tell you for a long time but.. Stop!

531
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,560
I didn’t see anything!

532
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,360
Mom, Seen and I love each other.

533
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,120
How dare you admit it?!

534
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,200
How dare you say?!

535
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
That you love him?

536
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,560
Do you want to see me die?

537
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Do you want to see me go insane?

538
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Mom,

539
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
Seen and I just love each other.

540
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,440
Stop arguing!

541
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,400
Remember this,

542
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
if you insist on loving him…

543
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
Don’t call me your mother.

544
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,000
Ahh!

545
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Go then!

546
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,360
I’m not going!

547
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,320
Go! Let go!

548
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Go!

549
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,200
Go!

550
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
Dad!

551
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
I’m not going!

552
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,200
Dad, do I really have to go?

553
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,000
Dad! I don't want to go.

554
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,200
Seen!

555
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,840
Hey!

556
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,120
What the hell are you doing?

557
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
Seen.

558
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,160
Seen!

559
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,160
Where are you taking him?

560
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,640
Seen!

561
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,520
Seen!

562
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,600
Seen!

563
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Cut!

564
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,640
Scene seven, take two.

565
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,360
Next scene?

566
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,200
I liked it.

567
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,000
I think Saint did a great job.

568
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,840
Very good.

569
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,040
Saint was terrific.

570
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,720
How was it?

571
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,560
Ok.

572
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,880
Great.

573
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
You were so great.

574
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Lanee?

575
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,360
Is there any scene you want to change?

576
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,240
What about the kiss scene?

577
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,040
By the clothesline, right?

578
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,640
Yeah.

579
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,760
Ah okay.

580
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,040
Alright then, since we still have plenty of time.

581
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,800
So we…

582
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,840
I want to go back and shoot

583
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,680
the kissing scene at the clothesline.

584
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,840
Where Choon walks in.

585
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,000
Because when you kissed back then.

586
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
You two looked so hesitant.

587
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,400
Is that okay?

588
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,640
Yes. Yes.

589
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Very good.

590
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,040
But this time

591
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,360
I want it to feel more intense than before.

592
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
And make it hotter.

593
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,760
Mm.

594
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
Try kissing like

595
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,840
you’ve wanted to kiss each other for a long time.

596
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,160
The vibe of filling in all the moments.

597
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,480
When we used to hold back in the past.

598
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay?

599
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,800
Mm.

600
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,480
Ready?

601
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,640
If you’re ready then.

602
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,720
Three.

603
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,520
Two.

604
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,640
One.

605
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,480
Action.

606
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
Kiss more intensely.

607
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Kit slowly takes off Seen’s shirt.

608
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,200
What is that, Khem?

609
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,560
What are they doing?! Kaew,

610
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,960
they’re shooting a porn film.

611
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,360
Porn film?

612
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,120
Yes.

613
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,800
What are you doing?

614
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
Mom?

615
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,600
Ice.

616
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,960
You’re acting in porn to make money?

617
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,160
Mom?

618
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,760
I’m not.

619
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,120
I can see it clearly.

620
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,120
Are you

621
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,440
intentionally using Uncle Pakorn’s rental house

622
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,240
as a location to shoot porn?

623
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,600
This is Uncle Pakorn’s rental house?

624
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,560
Yes.

625
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,040
Why are you acting like this.

626
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
Can you stop shooting porn?

627
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,440
Please.

628
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
Mom,

629
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,240
I’m not shooting porn anymore.

630
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,480
And I didn’t know this was Uncle Pakorn’s house.

631
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,840
I’m just shooting a short film.

632
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,760
Don’t lie to me.

633
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,600
I’m not lying.

634
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,840
If you don’t believe me,

635
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,000
go check the front of the house.

636
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,000
Are you sure?

637
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,200
It’s just that… there might be a love scene or two.

638
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,120
Believe me.

639
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,240
Are you short on money or something.

640
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Give me your bank number, I’ll transfer you some.

641
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,320
Mom, I have money.

642
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,160
I’m not doing everything just for money anymore.

643
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Give me your bank number.

644
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,280
And use this money to take care of your father.

645
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,160
Mom…

646
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Dad is gone.

647
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,840
You…

648
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,040
You…

649
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,880
What do you mean?

650
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,760
What are you saying?

651
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,840
Back then

652
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,480
when I had to shoot porn,

653
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,960
it was because I had no choice.

654
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I had to pay off Dad’s debt.

655
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,600
Then why didn’t you tell me?

656
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,280
Didn't you tell me not to contact you?

657
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,160
(Can I stay by your side quietly.)

658
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I feel so terrible.

659
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,480
For walking out and leaving Mom crying alone.

660
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,680
But I couldn’t handle it either.

661
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,840
Do you think I was that wrong?

662
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,160
No.

663
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
Everyone has the right to not be okay.

664
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
And to walk away.

665
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
You know…

666
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,800
Since the day Mom told me

667
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,200
not to contact anyone.

668
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I never talked to her again.

669
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,280
Happy birthday to you.

670
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,920
Happy birthday to you.

671
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,640
Happy birthday, happy birthday.

672
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,520
Happy birthday to you.

673
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,000
Thank you.

674
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,200
Happy birthday, son.

675
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,000
I wish you to be the happiest kid in the world.

676
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,840
Make a wish, Ice.

677
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,000
And blow the candles.

678
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,080
Here.

679
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,680
Oh.

680
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,080
Uh…

681
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,200
What cake is this?

682
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,280
What is this?

683
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,680
Uh…

684
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,240
What.

685
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,920
It’s our son's birthday.

686
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,040
You should’ve bought me booze!! Ah!

687
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,800
Not bought me a damn cake! Ugh.

688
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,760
You…

689
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,840
Ugh. You need to be punished!

690
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,360
Dad no!

691
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,200
What?

692
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,200
Did you hit my kid!

693
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,240
Did you hit me, you bitch! Ah!

694
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,040
Ah!

695
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,680
Don’t!

696
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,640
Die!

697
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,640
Get out of my house right now.

698
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,560
Get out.

699
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,480
Go! Ice, go!

700
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,880
Hey, you don’t get to take your kid!

701
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,400
He's mine!

702
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,680
Go alone, Kaew!

703
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,600
If you take my kid.

704
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,920
I’ll shoot every last one of you.

705
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,280
Get out.

706
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
I’m going.

707
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,320
Ice,

708
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,280
listen to me.

709
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,200
When you grow up.

710
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Work and save money

711
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,480
and run away from here.

712
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,640
Don’t you ever submit to that bastard!

713
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:41,280
What the hell are you saying, Kaew?

714
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,440
Drop dead!

715
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,720
Damn it!

716
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,640
Don't listen to your mother!

717
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,480
Listen to me!

718
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,800
I'm your fucking father!

719
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
What the fuck you looking at?!

720
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,400
Fuck!

721
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,800
It’s because of me.

722
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,360
It’s all because of me, I’m bad luck.

723
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,320
No.

724
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Don’t think like that.

725
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,320
You’re not bad luck or anything like that.

726
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Stop thinking this way.

727
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,880
From now on

728
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
you cannot blame yourself anymore.

729
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Promise?

730
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,880
You don’t have to be afraid of anything now.

731
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,600
If you can’t handle it.

732
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
You still have me right here.

733
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,880
I’ll be the one holding you whenever you cry.

734
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,480
From now on…

735
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
I’ll stay by your side.

736
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Okay.

737
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,560
(Thank you for coming into my life)

738
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
(as a ray of sunshine,)

739
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,880
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

740
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,920
(from once withered to bloom again.)

741
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,040
You're so brave,

742
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,160
I've give you a reward.

743
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,560
I'm going to take you out.

744
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,160
Ok?

745
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,640
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

746
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,600
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

747
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,880
So Lanee and Saint,

748
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,800
are they together?

749
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,600
My daughter is dating Sea.

750
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,200
Did my dad order you to continue following me around?

751
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,600
I'm really sorry.

752
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,600
I don't really want to do this.

753
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,640
Go take a shower.

754
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,040
I'll take you there tomorrow.

755
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,520
The money that you sent me.

756
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,120
I've always kept it away in another account.

757
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,960
So that you don't have to go through anymore hardships.

758
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,320
From now on,

759
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,520
can I take on the role as your boyfriend?
