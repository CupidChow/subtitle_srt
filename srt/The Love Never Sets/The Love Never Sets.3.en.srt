1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,720
I know it’s rude to read someone else’s diary,

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
but I think there are things you should know.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,960
I was both furious and disgusted.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
I thought dying was the best way out.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,760
I guess I started liking the sea more too.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,000
What is it?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,640
Because it’s beautiful.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,080
The closer I look, the more I want to stay.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,680
I heard that tutor boy came back to school.

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,040
Is he back?

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
Sometimes I really wonder

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,240
what’s going on in your head.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,720
When you talk to me, you say one thing.

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,680
In the end,

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,720
you’re just the kind of person

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,320
who stands by and watches.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,440
Professor about that question you gave earlier.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I still don’t quite get it.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,560
Well, if you’d like to understand it better,

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
you can come to my place

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,920
and I'll tutor you all night.

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,160
So does this mean you have a private tutor class?

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Yes,

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
it's a private class.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
Many students have joined me

26
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
in my one on one classes.

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
It's only the beginning of the semester

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
and you're already looking for fresh meat?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Then I'll...

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Please excuse me, we'll talk later.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,600
What are you doing?

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Are you going to blackmail him, like me?

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Did I do that?

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,240
Uh.. Why don't I remember that at all?

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Do I need to remind you?

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Do I need to remind you?!

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
How fucked up it was?!

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,720
How many students did you this to?!

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
Hey! What are you doing?

40
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Ice!? You again?

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Why do you keep bothering us?

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
It's not like I want to be involved

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
with this kind of person.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,920
If you're not bothering us, then when was that?

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,720
If I hadn’t stopped you,

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,400
you probably would’ve punched him already, right?

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Forget about it, just ignore him.

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,520
I can’t just ignore it.

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,040
I think this kid has issues.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,000
He likes to destroy other people’s families.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
I didn’t mean to hurt your family, Professor.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,240
I just wanted to warn Professor Mint not to

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
repeat his old habits with the new student.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
What habits?

55
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
What more do you want from us?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,360
You already made me lose my baby last time.

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,280
I didn’t make you miscarry, and you know that.

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
If you hadn’t interfered with my family,

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
my child wouldn’t have died!

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
I don’t understand why the university

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,079
still gives someone like you another chance.

62
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,040
Such a gentleman, huh?

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,720
Letting a woman defend you.

64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
One day I’ll expose you.

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
What are you doing!?

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Saint?

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
What’s going on over there?

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Let’s go check.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
I’ll make sure you pay for this.

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
Come with me to the dean’s office.

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,960
I’m not going.

72
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,600
Come with me!

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
If I have to go, this bastard’s coming too!

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,880
I said come with me!

75
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,360
อาจารย์เหี้ยนี่แหละทำชีวิตผมพัง

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,960
I said I’m not going!

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,480
Come here, now!

78
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,000
Ice!

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,560
Come here, now!

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,320
You’re coming with me!

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,360
Professor Fah, don’t!

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
Professor Fah, please stop!

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,200
Professor Fah..

84
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
Fah!

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
What’s going on here!?

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,600
I won’t let this slide,

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,920
this is the second time already.

88
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Why does the university still let a student

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
with a record like this stay enrolled?

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
I don’t understand!

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,520
Please, calm down,

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
they both probably didn't mean to.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Then answer this, Ice..

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,080
Why did you attack Professor Mint?

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
What did he do to you?

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Uh, when we were in class,

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
everything seemed normal.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,640
But after class,

99
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
he got into an argument with Professor Mint

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,240
and Professor Fah.

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,200
Luckily Saint got there in time to stop it,

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
but it was probably too forceful

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,560
and caused Professor Fah to fall.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Then I’ll ask you again.

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,560
Do you have anything to explain?

106
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,640
Why did you attack Professor Mint?

107
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,600
…No, I don’t.

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,480
And you, Saint?

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
No.

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,760
So what should we do now?

111
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,640
You still want this student to stay at the university?

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
And what about my safety and Professor Mint’s?

113
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,040
Who’s going to guarantee that?

114
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,240
Please calm down, Professor Fah.

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
The disciplinary committee

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,960
already has procedures in place.

117
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,280
But in this case,

118
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,240
nothing meets the criteria for a severe punishment,

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
like expulsion or anything like that.

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,920
If we just wait,

121
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I'll probably be harassed every day.

122
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,920
How about this?

123
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,040
Maybe you should report this directly to the dean.

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,440
He might have a better way to handle it.

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
Professor Fah..

126
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
I’m really sorry that you fell earlier.

127
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
I want to take full responsibility for what I did.

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Please, don’t make this a big deal.

129
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,040
Wait,

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Saint.. Are you saying you’ll take disciplinary punishment?

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes.

132
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,680
You do know that

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
if you accept disciplinary punishment,

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
no matter how good your grades are,

135
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
you’ll lose eligibility

136
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
for the Outstanding Student Award this year, right?

137
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, I understand.

138
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
Either way, this semester

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I’ll be looking after Ice.

140
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
That way, Professor Fah, you can feel assured

141
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
this won’t happen again.

142
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,600
Let’s just end it here.

143
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
Fine.

144
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
But please,

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,240
don’t let anything like this happen again.

146
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
Then sign here.

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,600
(Aditep… Student under disciplinary action)

148
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,280
Mud,

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,120
don’t leave yet. I need to talk to you.

150
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,920
Yes.

151
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,559
I’ll help you.

152
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,159
Why would you help me?

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because it’s my fault too that

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
I bumped into Professor Fah.

155
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
Let me help clean up with you.

156
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Can you stop getting involved with me?

157
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
Why?

158
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Because I did wrong,

159
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,440
and I have to take responsibility.

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,920
And the more you hang around me,

161
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
the worse it’ll be for you.

162
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Fine.

163
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,400
If you really want to clean, then do it yourself.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Hey, Ice, wait!

165
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,960
I just want you to know,

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
whatever you’ve been through,

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
from now on, if anything happens,

168
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,400
you can tell me. I’ll help you.

169
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
What could you possibly do to help me?

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,680
Can you stop trying to come back into my life?

171
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,880
It’s too late.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,800
Just let me go.

173
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,080
I know now why you tried to kill yourself

174
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,200
and about what happened between you and Professor Mint.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But don’t be scared,

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you still have me by your side.

177
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,600
How do you know?

178
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,840
I read your diary.

179
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,520
I believe you.

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,120
Why did you do that?

181
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Why are you trying to get involved with me again?

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Please, let me help you, Ice.

183
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
If you really want to help me,

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
then stay out of my life.

185
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,880
Hey, babe.

186
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,280
Oh, hey.

187
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,000
Hmm?

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,160
I smell awful,

189
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,880
I was just cleaning up trash.

190
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,440
Why’d you do that?

191
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Volunteering at the university.

192
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
Oh, new headphones?

193
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
What happened to mine?

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My roommate broke them.

195
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,440
Really?

196
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,200
What happened?

197
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,000
Hmm?

198
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,600
It's nothing.

199
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,960
Why aren’t you sleeping in your dorm tonight?

200
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you miss me or something?

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I’m just sick of my roommate.

202
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,400
That roommate again!

203
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Want me to go deal with him for you, babe?

204
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,880
No,

205
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,920
it’s fine.

206
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,280
It's ok.

207
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,400
You sure?

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah.

209
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
So, how was class today?

210
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Anyone bothering you?

211
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,520
No one, babe.

212
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Did you see Saint at school?

213
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,200
How could I? We’re in different years.

214
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Good.

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
You want to rest for a bit?

216
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Hey, where’s my guitar that was right there?

217
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
Oh,

218
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,560
I took it to my friend’s studio to record something,

219
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
but I think I left it there.

220
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,280
Yeah…

221
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
But babe,

222
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,640
can I borrow your guitar for my tour?

223
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
For this concert?

224
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
Please?

225
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,920
You should’ve asked first, don’t you think?

226
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Come on, babe,

227
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,320
you weren’t even using it.

228
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
I didn’t want it to rust,

229
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,960
so I used it to keep it in good shape.

230
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,520
And now I’m attached to it, it feels so good to play.

231
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,360
Please, babe,

232
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
if I play your song on stage,

233
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,360
I’ll tell everyone that

234
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
it’s a song my boyfriend wrote for me.

235
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,080
How’s that sound?

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
I Promise.

237
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,000
Okay?

238
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,000
I promise.

239
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,200
Promise?

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,640
Hmm?

241
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I Promise,

242
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,640
Ice.

243
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Hmm?

244
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,400
You’re the cutest.

245
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Who do you belong to, huh?

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,920
Babe,

247
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
we’ve been together for a while now.

248
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Can’t we kiss like other couples do?

249
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
My friend’s been dating this person for one day,

250
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
and they’ve already done way more than just kiss.

251
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
Warm…

252
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
I smell so bad,

253
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,960
I need a shower first.

254
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,640
Huh?

255
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,080
I’m all sweaty, Warm.

256
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
I’ll be quick.

257
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,680
Really?

258
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,560
Ice, uh....

259
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Oh, shit!

260
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,760
Hey,

261
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,560
Pas's father came to be

262
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,120
the music therapist teacher today.

263
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,360
Wanna check the class out?

264
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
No,

265
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,280
you go ahead.

266
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
I’ll just wait here.

267
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,320
But I think you look a little down today.

268
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Maybe try something new?

269
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
It looks fun,

270
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I think it’d help.

271
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,680
Book’s going too.

272
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Yeah, let’s go.

273
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,240
Come on,

274
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,360
let’s go heal our hearts.

275
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Okay, let’s go.

276
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Alright, everyone, welcome.

277
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Hello.

278
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,120
Hi.

279
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,920
Hello.

280
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,480
So for today’s therapy class,

281
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,440
the goal isn’t just to play instruments,

282
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,200
music helps us feel

283
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,320
and connect with what’s inside of us.

284
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Alright,

285
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,280
let’s find an instrument you’re drawn to,

286
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,360
or you can just listen to the sounds first.

287
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,640
Go ahead, try it out.

288
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,800
We’ll start with a simple question today:

289
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Who do you miss the most right now?

290
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,520
And how are you connected to them?

291
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,040
Sometimes the smallest sound

292
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,480
is actually the loudest one in our hearts.

293
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,320
So, how do you feel, Ni?

294
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I’m… not sure.

295
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,720
That’s okay,

296
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,040
try playing and listen to what it tells you.

297
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
But he knows right...?

298
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
Did you really write this song yourself?

299
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,600
Yeah.

300
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,040
But it’s not finished yet.

301
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,520
Even unfinished, it’s beautiful.

302
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,680
You can write something this sweet,

303
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,640
you must’ve been in love before, right?

304
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Actually, no.

305
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,800
Really?

306
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,760
Have you ever had a crush on anyone?

307
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,880
Well…

308
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,520
I’ve only been focused on work and school.

309
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,520
Good, that’s good.

310
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,240
And what about you?

311
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
You like someone?

312
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,760
Hmm… by the way,

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
this guitar must’ve

314
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
been with you for a long time, right?

315
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,400
Yeah,

316
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,080
it was my mom’s.

317
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
She used to be really good at guitar.

318
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
If we don’t get to see each other again…

319
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,320
can I fix your guitar for you?

320
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,920
Fix it?

321
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,640
(Is it still me that you love?)

322
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:45,080
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

323
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,280
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

324
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,760
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

325
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,720
(can it still be me that you love?)

326
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,080
(I still hold on to every promise,)

327
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,880
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

328
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,360
(Change these cold nights )

329
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,840
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

330
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,760
(That's all I want to ask.)

331
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,760
Thank you.

332
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,200
Thank you.

333
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,560
That was so good.

334
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,320
Thank you.

335
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
How'd you get here?

336
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,600
Won't your dad get mad?

337
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
I'll just be here for a while

338
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
and then I'll head back to study.

339
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,480
Ah.

340
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,640
Hurrr.

341
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
It's fine.

342
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm all out.

343
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,280
One more.

344
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
But this time I'll help.

345
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,880
Just help me look.

346
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,320
Wait.

347
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,000
Huh? Is it straight?

348
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,680
It's straight.

349
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,280
Well?

350
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,800
Ok,

351
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
let's start.

352
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes!

353
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,040
Here, this is for you.

354
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Really?

355
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
Thank you.

356
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,280
Will we ever meet again?

357
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,240
Of course,

358
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
because I’m going to enter university with you.

359
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,360
Is it cute?

360
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Yes.

361
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Let me see.

362
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,120
That one’s fine too.

363
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,560
If you’ve found the instrument that

364
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
feels right to you,

365
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
then think about

366
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
the person you’re missing or thinking of.

367
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,840
What do you still hold onto with them?

368
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,960
Then slowly play and let the music flow.

369
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Dad, why are you doing this?

370
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,440
Go change, you’re meeting with Lanee’s family.

371
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,840
Don’t make me repeat myself.

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
I don’t like Lanee.

373
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
She’s my friend.

374
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
I’m going to celebrate with Ice.

375
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
Go change

376
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,920
and come downstairs!

377
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Now, imagine that

378
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,160
you’ve met the person you’re thinking of.

379
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
How would you feel?

380
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,920
Happy, sad,

381
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,560
relieved, or in pain?

382
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,600
Let yourself enter that memory slowly.

383
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,440
Let go!

384
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
You think I’m stupid?

385
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,800
You’re still planning to see him?

386
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
I’ve already told the school to suspend him.

387
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,920
Stop seeing him,

388
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
think about your father for once.

389
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Why are you doing this, Dad?

390
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,760
Dad!

391
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,280
Dad!

392
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Dad!

393
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,080
Dad!

394
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Let me go!

395
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,280
Give me back my phone!

396
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,440
If you don’t stop obsessing over that tutor,

397
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,160
don’t ever expect to be let out.

398
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,440
Dad!

399
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Dad, please don’t do this.

400
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,240
Dad!

401
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,720
Keep a close eye on him!

402
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,400
If he keeps acting crazy,

403
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,480
lock him up and don’t let him leave.

404
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Then think about what you’d like to tell that person,

405
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,760
something you want them to know.

406
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,040
Try expressing it through the instrument.

407
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,280
You’re lucky we got to you in time.

408
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,880
When you arrived,

409
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,920
we had to pump your stomach immediately.

410
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,080
You may feel tired

411
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,040
or nauseous afterward, that’s normal.

412
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,880
You don’t have to hurt yourself anymore.

413
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,520
You’re safe now.

414
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,480
The police have already deleted all the videos.

415
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,640
We’ve detained the people who forced you to do it.

416
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,720
If anything happens again,

417
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,800
report it to the police right away.

418
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,560
Thank you.

419
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
Thank you, officer.

420
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,800
Get plenty of rest, alright?

421
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,960
Okay.

422
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,000
Thank you, doctor.

423
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
Thank you for all the information.

424
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,920
Yes.

425
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,760
If it weren’t for you, things could’ve ended badly.

426
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,040
Thank you.

427
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,360
I’m sorry, Sea.

428
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,200
It’s alright, everything will get better.

429
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,880
Get some rest.

430
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Excuse me, I’m going to the bathroom.

431
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Keep playing, everyone.

432
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,360
What the hell is wrong with Ice?

433
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,840
Because of him, I got called in by the professor

434
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,360
even though I didn’t do anything.

435
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,760
And he got Saint punished too.

436
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,080
And Professor Sara only made him pick up trash?

437
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
What a joke! Totally unfair.

438
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,239
I feel like paying him back.

439
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,560
Mud,

440
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,760
what are you gonna do to Ice now?

441
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,920
Don’t know yet.

442
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
But he’s gonna get what’s coming to him.

443
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,280
Trash like him still gets to study here?

444
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Why do you hate him so much?

445
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
I don’t hate him,

446
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
I just want to make our society better.

447
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,720
Mud,

448
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,840
calm down, man.

449
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
If someone never had a problem with you before,

450
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
why would they start one out of nowhere?

451
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,080
Ever think maybe Professor Mint

452
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,960
did something to him first?

453
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,640
I don’t know.

454
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
But he hurt my friend,

455
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
so I’m gonna make him pay.

456
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,160
Whatever, don't say I didn't warn you.

457
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
You’ll see soon enough.

458
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,280
You never stop whining, Book.

459
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,760
So annoying.

460
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,800
Hey, Ten!

461
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,880
I’ve got the perfect plan for revenge.

462
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
What do you want me to do now, Mud?

463
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,160
What the hell are you staring at?

464
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,760
Hey!

465
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
What are you looking at?

466
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
Go, go.

467
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,680
Which room?

468
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Hold on.

469
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,320
Which room?

470
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,000
This one.

471
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Hurry up.

472
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,600
I’ll do the writing myself.

473
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Yeah, just hurry up.

474
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,000
Hold it still, dude.

475
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,240
(TRASH)

476
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
I’ll make sure everyone sees this clearly.

477
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
If he reads this, man, I’ll cry tears of joy.

478
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
(EVIL)

479
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,320
Damn, it’s hot as hell.

480
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,840
What?

481
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,800
Why are you taking that off?

482
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,080
It’s hot.

483
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,720
Then why’d you make me wear this?

484
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,080
Here, we’re done.

485
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,560
Hey.

486
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
Dude, someone’s coming.

487
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
Is it Ice? I don’t know.

488
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,280
What is that?

489
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,240
Go, go.

490
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,880
Put the hat on.

491
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,880
Just go, forget it. Ten, you idiot.

492
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
(EVIL TRASH)

493
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Alright, safe and sound.

494
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Okay, bye-bye, see you.

495
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Ice, what are you doing, dear?

496
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,560
Ice?

497
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,080
Huh!?

498
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Who did this?

499
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,720
What happened?

500
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
If the landlord sees this,

501
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,520
they’re gonna kill me.

502
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Are you okay?

503
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
There! Saint!

504
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,560
Hurry,

505
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,240
come here!

506
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,480
Something happened!

507
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,120
What happened?

508
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
Here.

509
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,160
See for yourself.

510
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
(EVIL TRASH)

511
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,840
If the owner asks for compensation,

512
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,800
I’ll pay.

513
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,040
It’s fine, I’ll handle it.

514
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,280
I’m really sorry.

515
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,960
I have to apologize to Ice and Saint for what happened.

516
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,520
I’ll tighten the building’s security.

517
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,440
From now on, outsiders won’t be allowed in at all.

518
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,160
But right now, I’ll go check the CCTV footage.

519
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,000
There are two camera angles.

520
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,760
Give me a second,

521
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,240
I’ll be right back.

522
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,160
Stay calm, everyone!

523
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
Stay calm! I’ll be right back.

524
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,280
You okay?

525
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,000
Are you hurt?

526
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
I’m fine, move.

527
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,520
(TRASH)

528
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,160
Ice.

529
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,440
Ice.

530
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,320
Hey.

531
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,240
Ice.

532
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,960
Wait.

533
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,800
Hey.

534
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,840
Don’t worry about the door.

535
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,640
I’ll buy paint and fix it myself.

536
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
You can kick me out if you want.

537
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Why would I?

538
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,400
You didn’t do anything wrong.

539
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
The one who wrote on the wall is the one at fault.

540
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,320
If it weren’t for me,

541
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,520
you wouldn’t have to deal with this crap.

542
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,320
No,

543
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,480
this isn’t your fault.

544
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,840
I’ll go talk to Meena and find out who did it.

545
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,400
Forget it.

546
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
It’s easier if I just move out.

547
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,000
You’re not going anywhere.

548
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,760
Get some rest. I’ll clean it up.

549
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,920
Hey.

550
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
I said I’ll clean it.

551
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
Can you stop being nice to me for once?

552
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,000
Just be mad at me!

553
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,960
Yell at me!

554
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,440
I caused you all this trouble,

555
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,080
and you’re still being nice?

556
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Why are you still helping me?

557
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,840
Hello, this is Pas.

558
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,720
Are you close to Or's restuarant yet?

559
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm almost there.

560
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,280
I’ll head over soon.

561
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,720
Just a bit.

562
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
I’ll finish cleaning later.

563
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,800
(It’s because of me, the way I am.)

564
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:28,160
(I made you disappointed, I made you hurt.)

565
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,680
(Aren’t you tired of someone like me?)

566
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:42,760
(All I do is make you cry.)

567
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,520
(No matter how much I love you,)

568
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,920
(I still let you down.)

569
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,680
(Believe me, it hurts me too,)

570
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,240
(the things I’ve done.)

571
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,400
(I’m so sorry, this is all I can do.)

572
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,520
(Even though I love you so much,)

573
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,360
(I still end up hurting you.)

574
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:16,720
(Sorry that I’m like this.)

575
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,480
(I’d do anything if you could forgive me.)

576
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,800
(I never meant to hurt you.)

577
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,680
Woohoo!

578
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,880
That was beautiful!

579
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,200
So cute!

580
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,160
You sang so well!

581
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,840
Thank you so much, everyone.

582
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,000
Hope to see you again soon.

583
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Woohoo!

584
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Thank you!

585
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,440
That part just now was great.

586
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,880
I’m heading out, see you.

587
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,000
Ice,

588
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,800
you played so well tonight.

589
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,160
Guess I’ll have to come drum for you more often.

590
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,720
Not really.

591
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,560
I still have a lot to improve.

592
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
Come on, they were screaming for you.

593
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,720
Thank you.

594
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,640
Ice!

595
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,040
Hi. Hi! Hi!

596
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,600
The customers loved your performance!

597
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,080
You passed the audition.

598
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,680
So, can you play here every night?

599
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,000
Yes.

600
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,520
Thank you.

601
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,000
We’ll talk about the schedule later.

602
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,480
Sure.

603
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,880
Okay, great!

604
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,280
You were amazing. Hey, congrats, man!

605
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,760
The kid’s got talent, I’m telling you.

606
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,640
Yeah.

607
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Place is packed tonight.

608
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Good table spots too.

609
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
That corner’s not bad either.

610
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,760
Hey, you guys go grab seats first.

611
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,640
I’ll be right there.

612
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,920
If that’s all.

613
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
I’ll head home now.

614
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,440
Sure, sure. Go ahead.

615
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,160
See you later.

616
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,480
Get home safe. He’s in a rush, huh?

617
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Okay, bye!

618
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,400
Was gonna ask him to eat with us.

619
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,040
Zoom,

620
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,440
what are you doing around here?

621
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,600
Oh,

622
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,720
I came to drink beer

623
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,320
but I’m heading home soon.

624
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,360
Hey,

625
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,640
is Professor Mint telling you to go see him?

626
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,640
If he is, then so what?

627
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,240
So you’re still with him?

628
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,200
Even though you know how shitty he is.

629
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,000
What do you want me to do about it?

630
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,600
Expose him?

631
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,880
If Professor Mint gets exposed,

632
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,520
no one else will be his victim anymore, right?

633
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I don’t want a life like yours.

634
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,200
I don’t want a leaked video.

635
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,960
One more term and I graduate.

636
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,280
If this blows up,

637
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,120
my future’s ruined like yours.

638
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
So you choose to stay with him, huh.

639
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,040
Yeah,

640
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,120
if I help film and I survive,

641
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,000
I’ll stay.

642
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,000
Zoom,

643
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,960
listen to me.

644
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,040
You know what happens

645
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,800
when you mess with Professor Mint.

646
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,920
Our lives are kinda similar.

647
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,920
Our moms left, there's so much debt,

648
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,920
but I still have a dad to take care of,

649
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,920
not like you.

650
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Just let me graduate quietly, please.

651
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,840
I beg you.

652
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
So what’s the plan, Ten?

653
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,000
I think we need proof.

654
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,680
Either Professor Mint... or Professor Mint?

655
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,680
Fuck.

656
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,960
I can’t take it anymore.

657
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,000
But the live music’s really good.

658
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah. Live music’s great.

659
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,000
You gotta come here more often.

660
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,240
The music’s awesome. Yeah.

661
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,040
Hey Sea,

662
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,400
I’m heading to the bathroom real quick.

663
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,040
Ah, okay.

664
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,640
I think my stomach’s upset, can’t handle it.

665
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,080
You drank a lot, huh.

666
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,960
Yeah, I can’t. Alright.

667
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,560
Ice?

668
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,960
Hey.

669
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Ice.

670
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,640
Huh?

671
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,320
Ice. Huh?

672
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,760
Get up, why are you lying here like this?

673
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,400
No, I don’t want to.

674
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,320
Get up.

675
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,040
Hm?

676
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,560
Get up now.

677
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,400
Get up. What the hell.

678
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Why are you sleeping here?

679
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,440
Hey!

680
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Let go,

681
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,040
you can't have this.

682
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,080
I’ll drink it myself. Hey.

683
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
Hey, that’s mine.

684
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,640
Hey, that’s mine.

685
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Not okay.

686
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
What’s not okay?

687
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,440
What's wrong?

688
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,400
What happened?

689
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,800
Want to tell me?

690
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,680
I hate myself so much.

691
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,600
Why do I always bring bad luck to him?

692
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,320
Who are you talking about?

693
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,320
Saint?

694
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,680
Yeah,

695
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,840
but whatever,

696
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,920
it’s not the same anymore.

697
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,200
Calm down.

698
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,920
Saint actually cares about you, man.

699
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
Why don’t I feel it at all?

700
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,400
He really does care.

701
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,200
Hey.

702
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,000
Ice. I don’t feel anything.

703
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,080
Ice.

704
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,120
Hm?

705
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,480
Ice.

706
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,280
I don't believe it.

707
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,360
I just talked to you, are you asleep already?

708
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,080
I don’t feel anything.

709
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Ice.

710
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,480
Ice. Hm?

711
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,600
Ice.

712
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Hello, Sea?

713
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,160
Yeah, hello.

714
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,200
Saint, can you help me carry Ice?

715
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,680
He’s passed out drunk.

716
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,880
Yes, yes, I will.

717
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,000
Hey.

718
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,880
Hurry up.

719
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,840
Ice. Quick.

720
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,760
Go back to your room and sleep.

721
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,120
Come on. Hey.

722
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,920
Come here.

723
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,240
I’ll sleep wherever I want.

724
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:25,920
Go.

725
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,000
I don’t want to go back.

726
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,760
Ice. Walk properly, Ice.

727
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,360
I’m not going back.

728
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,520
Not going back!

729
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,520
Go back!

730
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,160
Not going back!

731
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,640
Come in.

732
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,480
Not going back!

733
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,640
Come in.

734
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,840
Watch his head.

735
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,800
Not okay.

736
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,880
Not okay at all.

737
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,480
Hey, take him back in one piece.

738
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,160
Don’t worry,

739
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,600
thanks for calling.

740
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,080
Sure.

741
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,920
It's all a mess. I’m so sorry ..

742
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,480
Hey!

743
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,160
that this is all I can do. Hey!

744
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,480
Ice.

745
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,760
Hey, Ice!

746
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,160
Ice, come back here. Ice.

747
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,400
Ice.

748
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,880
Don’t go.

749
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,800
Come back!

750
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,600
Ice! Don’t go.

751
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,800
Stop running!

752
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,000
Let me go!

753
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,560
Ice. Let me go!

754
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,000
No.

755
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,120
Ice, be careful you’ll fall.

756
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,320
I’m not going to,

757
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,280
I’m not that drunk, kiddo!

758
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,400
Sit properly.

759
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,960
I’m not drunk.

760
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,040
Ouch.

761
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
Sit still, I’ll wipe you down.

762
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,120
I’m too tired to sit.

763
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,880
Come on.

764
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,200
I don’t want to sit.

765
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,840
Take off your shirt. Saint.

766
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,520
Ice, you’ll fall forward.

767
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,800
I'm not gonna...

768
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,440
No…

769
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,720
Just sit for a bit, okay?

770
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:36,440
(I’m so sorry that this is all I can do.)

771
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,600
(Even though I love you so much,)

772
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,600
( I still hurt you.)

773
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,440
Ice, sit still.

774
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,080
Stop,

775
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,280
if you come in here, you’ll get hit, okay?

776
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,880
This is my stage.

777
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
(I'm so sorry..)

778
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,360
Happy now?

779
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,440
If you’re satisfied, come down and I’ll wipe you.

780
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,120
Come on.

781
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,520
Hey, stop! I’ll actually hit you, kid.

782
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,920
(I’m so sorry that this is all I can do.)

783
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,320
Come down, hurry. Let go.

784
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,440
Ow.

785
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,960
Come down now. Let go.

786
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,720
Let go.

787
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,640
Saint!

788
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Saint,

789
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,760
I’m sorry.

790
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,320
Are you okay, Saint?

791
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,920
Are you hurt? I’m sorry.

792
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,120
Are you hurt?

793
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,960
I didn’t mean it, sorry, Saint.

794
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,880
Saint.

795
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,440
Saint.

796
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,280
I’m not hurt.

797
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
If you want to hit me, hit me.

798
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,880
Sorry,

799
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
you must be hurt.

800
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,680
I’m sorry for everything, Saint.

801
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,640
Hmm,

802
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,360
Saint.

803
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,880
Whether it’s about school, the paint,

804
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,200
or me yelling at you.

805
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,360
I’m sorry.

806
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,360
You can punch me or yell at me.

807
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,280
But please don’t disappear from my life,

808
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,440
okay, Saint?

809
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,480
Hit me if you want.

810
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,880
Hit me.

811
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,000
Hit me.

812
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,360
Hey Ice, that’s enough.

813
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,280
Enough.

814
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,640
I won’t disappear anymore.

815
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,640
Do you mean it?

816
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,480
Yeah,

817
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,920
I promise.

818
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,680
Sorry

819
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,800
I was never able to help you.

820
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,800
Sorry.

821
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Sorry too, Saint.

822
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,800
It wasn’t your fault,

823
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,000
let me help you back from now on.

824
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,880
Thank you, Saint.

825
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Saint, thank you.

826
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,720
When you sober up,

827
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,240
I’ll tell you the whole truth.

828
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,120
Why did my outfit change?

829
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,560
Did you do something to me?

830
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,320
I didn't.

831
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,240
You were the one who took everything off.

832
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
Let's see your homework.

833
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,280
Give it to me.

834
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,480
Hey,

835
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,560
let me go. Ow.

836
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,080
Why do you guys have so many problems?

837
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,520
Come on and clear it up.

838
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,920
I like you.

839
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,560
I really do.

840
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,080
Saint.

841
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,280
Do you want to practice the scene with me?
