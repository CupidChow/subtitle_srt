1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,880
You can kick me out if you want.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,200
Why would I?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,640
If it weren’t for me,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,600
you wouldn’t have to deal with this crap.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,280
It's not your fault.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,160
The one who wrote on the wall is the one at fault.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,560
Put the hat on.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,960
You know what happens

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
when you mess with Professor Mint.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,160
Just let me graduate quietly, please.

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
I think we need proof.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,200
Sorry I was never able to help you.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,920
Sorry too, Saint.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,240
When you sober up,

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,560
I’ll tell you the whole truth.

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,039
(Ice)

17
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,039
Hello, you’re awake?

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
Yeah…

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,200
thank you.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,640
You must’ve taken care of me last night, right?

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,280
But, uh… you didn’t have to change my clothes

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
or underwear, you know.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,320
Hmm?

24
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,160
Change what?

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,360
Saint was the one who took you

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,000
back to your room last night.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,360
Saint?

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,560
Then…

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Saint saw my dick?!

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,600
Well, you were drunk out of your mind,

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
acting wild and refusing to go back to your room.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,440
Did I cause a scene last night or did I cry?

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
Did I do anything embarrassing or kiss anyone?

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh god, let’s just say

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,079
the video clip could tell it better than I can.

36
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,000
And don’t forget to thank Saint.

37
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Ice, stop moving already!

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,680
No.

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,160
Come on, let’s go back.

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,360
You’re hugging the pole like a damn panda!

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Ice, let’s go home, okay?

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
If you don’t let go,

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
I’ll bite you!

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Hey!

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
Ow!

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,720
What the hell, Ice?!

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,440
I’m not Ice,

48
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I’m a panda!

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
You’ve been bitten! You’re dead for sure!

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Let’s go!

51
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,160
Shit!

52
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Morning.

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,640
What?

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Nothing.

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Hey.

56
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,280
Let’s clear something up.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Why did my clothes change?

58
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
Did you take advantage of me?

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,640
What?

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,640
You’re the one who took everything off.

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,160
I said I’d wait outside,

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
but you wouldn’t listen.

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
You kept saying,

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
Saint, take it off for me.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
Something like, take it off

67
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,960
and something about hugs.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,840
I don’t believe you.

69
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,080
Wanna see the video?

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,400
You have one?

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,160
No.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,440
But Meena might.

73
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
You started undressing

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,120
before we even got in the elevator.

75
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,480
If you don’t believe me, check the CCTV.

76
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
Oh…

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,159
Did anyone else see?

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,720
Just me.

79
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Good thing I got you inside in time.

80
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
Otherwise, it would’ve gone viral for sure.

81
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,640
Why did I have to be the one

82
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,520
who saw your dick when you’re drunk?

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
If I wasn’t drunk, you wouldn’t have seen it!

84
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,200
And what happened to your hand?

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,480
Hot porridge burn?

86
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,160
Yeah, hot porridge burn.

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Burned so bad I should probably get a rabies shot!

88
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,760
Serves you right.

89
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,880
That’s what you get for messing with me.

90
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,680
If you wanna move out, now’s your chance

91
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,480
before the landlord charges us for the paint.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,680
What paint?

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,520
The..

94
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,159
paint on the door.

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
You could have just left it.

96
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,760
I would have scrubed it off.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don’t want people saying that

98
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,240
all I did was watch you get bullied.

99
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,240
Anyway, about the guy who did it,

100
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
Meena’s already checking the CCTV footage.

101
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,800
We’ll probably know who it was by today.

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,080
Hey, don’t cross the line.

103
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,680
Step back.

104
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,480
Here, breakfast.

105
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
Saint,

106
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,280
give it!

107
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
That’s it?

108
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah.

109
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
That’s it?

110
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

111
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,720
Is it spoiled?

112
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Welcome, Saint and Ice,

113
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,760
to the first Midnight Sun Workshop!

114
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Woohoo!

115
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
Yay!

116
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
Happy faces, come on!

117
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
Okay,

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,400
today we’re jumping right into scene work.

119
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,560
Remember the scene you auditioned with?

120
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,280
Yes. Yes.

121
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,000
Let’s see what you’ve got for us.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,320
If you're ready,

123
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,760
let's start.

124
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,919
Three.

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,960
Two.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,560
One.

127
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,480
Action!

128
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,480
What are you doing?

129
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,200
Nothing.

130
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,160
Give it here.

131
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Hey, don’t!

132
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
Let go!

133
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,640
Hey,

134
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,000
Don’t!

135
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Get out!

136
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,360
Don’t!

137
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Let go!

138
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,240
You might need to hold me tighter than that.

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
Let’s go again.

140
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,000
Three.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,240
Two.

142
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
One.

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,640
Action!

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
What are you doing?

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,400
Nothing.

146
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Give it to me.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Hey, let go!

148
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
Let go!

149
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,440
You like me, don’t you?

150
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
Uh…

151
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,000
aren’t you supposed to say that after the mom leaves?

152
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay,

153
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,480
stop for a sec.

154
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
I don’t think that worked.

155
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
Let’s talk.

156
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,960
What’s your take on the scene?

157
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,840
I’m still confused.

158
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
What kind of character is this?

159
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
Has he ever even been mad at anyone before?

160
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,840
He’s way too soft.

161
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,720
If it were me,

162
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,400
I’d hit back hard.

163
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Did you mean to make him so weak?

164
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,000
What do you think, Saint?

165
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,360
I don’t think it’s strange

166
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,640
that he's not angry.

167
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,800
Why?

168
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Because he’s probably angriest

169
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,120
at himself for being helpless.

170
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,440
He’s poor, can’t make money,

171
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,720
his dad’s sick,

172
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,200
and he can’t do anything to help.

173
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
He just keeps living day by day,

174
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
watching everything fall apart.

175
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,840
And his dad?

176
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Is he still a father at that point?

177
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
After everything he’s done,

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
why does Seen still forgive him?

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,880
He just loves his dad, that’s all.

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Love?

181
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
More like being a coward.

182
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
No, he just craves warmth.

183
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,960
Seen wants a loving family.

184
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,120
He believes one day his dad will change

185
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
from a bad person to someone better.

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That he’ll understand him

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,720
and love him again.

188
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
And you, Saint?

189
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,560
Any more questions?

190
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah.

191
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,280
Why does Kit hurt Seen?

192
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,720
Choking him,

193
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,200
slapping him, talking down to him.

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,440
And Seen still loves someone like him?

195
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
What do you think, Ice?

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
I think Kit’s just confused.

197
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,880
He doesn’t dare to admit

198
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
or show how he really feels,

199
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,320
so he pretends he doesn’t care

200
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,000
to make himself seem normal for that time.

201
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,200
By making the person he likes feel bad?

202
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
Yeah, it's set in 1997.

203
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,720
Back then, Thai media still portrayed gay people as bad.

204
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
Promiscuous, drug users,

205
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
killers and AIDS carriers.

206
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,080
People who were LGBTQ in that era

207
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,400
couldn’t come out.

208
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,760
When the inner and outer conflicts clash,

209
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,600
it leads to...

210
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,760
violent emotions.

211
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

212
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,360
Hey.

213
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,800
No reason.

214
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Maybe we should have you two switch roles next time.

215
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
But it just doesn’t look right in my head yet.

216
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
Let’s rehearse again,

217
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,560
you both still seem awkward.

218
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,000
I’ll direct this time.

219
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I read the script, and…

220
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,800
there are a lot of love scenes.

221
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,520
And some are intense, right?

222
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah.

223
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
If you’re uncomfortable,

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,120
you don’t have to do anything you don’t want.

225
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,080
But I don’t know if it’s too late to drop out now.

226
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,640
No,

227
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
I want to do it.

228
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,760
He wants to!

229
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Oh my~

230
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
But...

231
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,000
I might not be very good at it.

232
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I've...

233
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
I've never done it before.

234
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,440
Huh?

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,000
Really?

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
You've never done it?

237
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,520
Wow!

238
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,800
Everyone! Our lead actor is still a virgin!

239
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
Or will this drama be the first step

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,440
that leads Saint into more love scenes?

241
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Will he survive or flop?

242
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
Stay tuned.

243
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
Say hi~

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
Action!

245
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
What are you doing?

246
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,640
Nothing.

247
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,240
Give it here.

248
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
Hey,

249
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
let go.

250
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,880
Let go!

251
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,440
Let go!

252
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Let go!

253
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Wait,

254
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,520
this isn’t working

255
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,800
Ice, look at Saint first,

256
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
you don’t need to actually go into blocking yet.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Saint,

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,280
take your shirt off and let Ice smell it now.

259
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,520
Give it to me.

260
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
Take it off.

261
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
Hurry up.

262
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,120
Make eye contact so we can see their emotions first.

263
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,040
Seen, sniff the shirt

264
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,280
and make it smell like Kit for real.

265
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,040
Hurry up, take it.

266
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
Quick.

267
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
Three.

268
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,680
Two.

269
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
One.

270
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,280
Action!

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,120
What are you doing?

272
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,680
Nothing.

273
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Give it to me.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,840
Hey!

275
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,080
Let go!

276
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Don’t!

277
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,960
Let go! damn it!

278
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,160
Damn it! Let go!

279
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,840
Kit!

280
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
You grab his neck,

281
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
force him!

282
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Come on,

283
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,640
squeeze!

284
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,440
Let go!

285
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,960
Ow!

286
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,000
And then ask him something.

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Anything, improvise a little.

288
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Kit, what are you feeling, say it out loud.

289
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
You like me, don’t you?

290
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
You’re smelling my shirt.

291
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
Answer me.

292
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Let go!

293
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
Answer me!

294
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
Harder!

295
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Answer me!

296
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,240
I told you to let go, damn it!!

297
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,040
Hey!

298
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,200
Saint!

299
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Huh?

300
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,760
Are you ok?

301
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,920
Saint, are you ok?

302
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,600
I’m fine.

303
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,200
Are you okay?

304
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,320
You okay, right?

305
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,800
Does it hurt?

306
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
I’m sorry.

307
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
It’s fine,

308
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,319
you should apologize to Saint.

309
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,760
I’m fine.

310
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,319
I was going a bit hard too.

311
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,960
Honestly.

312
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

313
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,440
On casting day you two were amazing together.

314
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,320
Now today you can’t even look at each other.

315
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,640
Can you open up and clear this up?

316
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
You’re roommates

317
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,040
but you only talk when you’re drunk?

318
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,920
I tried but…

319
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
Our schedules don’t line up much,

320
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
so we don’t get to talk.

321
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,520
Then message each other.

322
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,480
I can’t,

323
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,680
he blocked my number.

324
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,360
Ugh!

325
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
I’m losing it!

326
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,800
If you care about my project at all,

327
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,520
talk to each other, please.

328
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,720
And take out your phone and unblock him right now!

329
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Now!

330
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,840
Geez, what's up with your friends?

331
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,120
Did you tell people about

332
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,560
what happened in the workshop room?

333
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,600
No.

334
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,920
I’ll talk to them.

335
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,160
Don’t.

336
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
This time I’ll talk to them.

337
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,760
Sorry!!

338
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,640
The two of us

339
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,000
acknowledge the wrongs we did to you before.

340
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
If the Mint situation gets exposed,

341
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,960
there won’t be more victims of Prof. Mint, right?

342
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,000
You know what happens if you mess with him.

343
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
We shouldn’t bully

344
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,360
or belittle or shame you for having done porn before.

345
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,840
And we shouldn’t judge you based on what others say.

346
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,040
Or stomp on you,

347
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,960
rub it in when you're down.

348
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,680
Sorry for stealing your songwriting notebook.

349
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,160
And sorry for painting your door.

350
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
Even if it was all Mud’s idea alone.

351
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Yeah!

352
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,160
Yeah.

353
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,920
Ten!

354
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,360
Okay, anyway, we apologize

355
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,760
for all the shitty stuff we did to you.

356
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,360
And to make it up to you.

357
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,840
I found evidence.

358
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Witnesses!

359
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,160
Ugh..

360
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,360
Come on, tell us what you did to him.

361
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,200
I printed pictures of Ice.

362
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
I tossed the paper around on the first day of classes.

363
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
The whole thing with

364
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,360
splashing water to mop the floor on Ice,

365
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
that was us too.

366
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,280
Anything else?

367
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,720
Sorry.

368
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,320
Ready?

369
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,960
Uh.

370
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,560
One.

371
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Two.

372
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,480
Three.

373
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,640
Hey!

374
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,840
What the hell are you doing?

375
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
The floor’s a mess now!

376
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,360
The teachers are going to yell for sure!

377
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
If you're done then help scrub it all clean.

378
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Shit, I told you we’d get scolded.

379
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,960
But honestly we didn’t want to do it.

380
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
Someone hired us to do it.

381
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,440
Don’t make excuses.

382
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,960
Hey.

383
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
I want to know who hired you.

384
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I don’t know.

385
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,240
Suddenly 3,000 baht was put in our locker.

386
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
And they told us to do as instructed.

387
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,200
And you all did it?

388
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,080
Well, the money was good.

389
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Do it once and get another 3,000.

390
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah, I also got it.

391
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,840
It's not easy to find 6,000 baht in one day!

392
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,080
Ice, I'm really sorry.

393
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,240
I really was wrong.

394
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Yeah, I believe you now.

395
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,200
That you’re truly sorry.

396
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,320
Yes!

397
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Then can I get a hug?

398
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,920
Hey, maybe later.

399
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
So from now on,

400
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
we’re friends, okay?

401
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,760
Is that fine?

402
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,960
And if there’s ever anything you need help with,

403
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,360
all five of us will help.

404
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
We’re willing to do it.

405
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,800
Right, guys?

406
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,080
Right, Ten?

407
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,640
Yeah?

408
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,680
Yeah,

409
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,520
sure.

410
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
Damn,

411
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,280
what the hell is this paint, it won’t come off.

412
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,960
Book!

413
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Book, you outside?

414
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,200
Yeah,

415
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,200
where do you want me to go?

416
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,920
Come scrub my back for me.

417
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,520
The paint got on me, I can’t reach.

418
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Then just use a back scrubber.

419
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,680
I don’t have one.

420
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,360
Fine, I’ll go buy one for you.

421
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,440
No.

422
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
You come in and scrub for me.

423
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,240
Hurry up, I’ve got plans tonight.

424
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,760
Okay,

425
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,080
but can you at least put on underwear or

426
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
a towel first?

427
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,000
Hurry up, damn it, stop stalling. Shit.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,840
What the hell?

429
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,920
What’s with you?

430
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Why are you acting shy?

431
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,120
Alright, you can scrub my back now.

432
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,480
Damn, sometimes I’m just so stupid.

433
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Always doing things without thinking.

434
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
Yeah,

435
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,800
I thought you’d be even dumber than this.

436
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,960
I’m glad you believe Ice.

437
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
I don’t.

438
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,320
I don’t believe Ice,

439
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,000
but I believe you.

440
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
You were right about everything.

441
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,760
You’re amazing.

442
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,120
Honestly,

443
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
if it weren’t for you,

444
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
I don’t know how I’d handle things.

445
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
Thanks.

446
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,560
Mm.

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Shit!

448
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Turn around, I’m done!

449
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
What’s wrong with you?

450
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,960
Yeah, all done..

451
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,840
Hey, wait.

452
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,560
What.

453
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,600
Let me see.

454
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Damn, Jymes Alan.

455
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,200
Yeah.

456
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,480
You got tickets?

457
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Someone forwarded them to me.

458
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
I don’t really know the person though.

459
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,000
You wanna go?

460
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,760
Sure!

461
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,680
But I don’t have money.

462
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,880
Take them, it’s fine, my treat.

463
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
Damn.

464
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Whoa.

465
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,760
You got two tickets?

466
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,480
Then...

467
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
can I have both?

468
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,360
I wanna take Cherry.

469
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,760
She’s a fan of Jymes Alan too.

470
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,160
Perfect,

471
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,720
I’m having dinner with her tonight.

472
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Damn.

473
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,120
Woah.

474
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Shit.

475
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,200
If I manage to win her over,

476
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,360
I’ll be your servant for a month.

477
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,280
Woah!

478
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,160
I’m off then.

479
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,440
Hey, wait,

480
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,840
can you drop it off for me?

481
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Just leave it in front of the TV.

482
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,840
I’m gonna shower.

483
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,160
I think we need a backup plan.

484
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,680
In case these two really can’t work together.

485
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,040
Like, kind really tune into each other.

486
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
We might have to change the cast.

487
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,520
(Lanee)

488
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,760
Honestly, Sea, just talk.

489
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,560
I am talking now.

490
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,360
I mean that, sis,

491
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,320
just talk to her.

492
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,120
She’s called several times and you haven’t answered once.

493
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,600
New girlfriend? Or an ex?

494
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,600
Who could it be?

495
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,360
Mm.

496
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,560
Hello, what’s up?

497
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,920
Where are you?

498
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,120
Studio.

499
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,120
Can you open the door for me?

500
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,240
Oh,

501
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,960
you’re here?

502
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,240
Why didn’t you tell me first?

503
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
Who do you think it is?

504
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,680
I think it’s the ex.

505
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,360
You didn't tell me you were coming,

506
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,640
how’d you get here?

507
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
I had the driver drop me off.

508
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,600
Everyone, this is Lanee...

509
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,520
Miss Lanee, daughter of TQB’s chairman,

510
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,680
our sponsor. Hello.

511
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,480
Hello.

512
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,360
Lanee, this is Cookie, and this is Katie.

513
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,960
Ah.

514
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Wow, you’re busy, huh?

515
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,600
Next time tell me if you're working.

516
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
I’d love to help.

517
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,240
Anything I can do to help?

518
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,960
No.

519
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Yes.

520
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,200
Actually, Sea's super stressed right now.

521
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,360
Because our two lead actors

522
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,000
can’t perform properly together.

523
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,400
Well, it's true.

524
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,080
Saint and Ice?

525
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,000
What happened?

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,240
I don’t really know, but I recorded it.

527
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
Let’s play it.

528
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,240
I hate you.

529
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,320
Just die already.

530
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,240
I told you to let go, damn it.

531
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,720
Is this how you guys workshop scenes?

532
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,760
Did you even do any ice-breaking before that?

533
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,280
Oh, we did! We went for hotpot together once.

534
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,720
I was actually just thinking..

535
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,480
maybe have them do a sit-up-and-kiss challenge.

536
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,560
Or feed each other tissue with their mouths.

537
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,640
Or just get them drunk

538
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
and let them make out for a whole round.

539
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Like that!

540
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,960
I ship them so much! Right?!

541
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,920
That’s exactly the kind of tension you see

542
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,240
when actors don’t feel safe.

543
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,520
And when they don’t trust each other.

544
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,640
You didn’t ask for consent first, did you?

545
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I don’t think we need to.

546
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,920
They already know each other from before.

547
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,560
Even if they’ve known each other since high school,

548
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,120
that doesn’t mean they can be scene partners

549
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
without any issues.

550
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,000
Especially when there’s unresolved tension between them.

551
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Wait,

552
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
how do you even know all this, Lanee?

553
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,840
I can tell just by watching the clip.

554
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,080
I’ll find a way for them to communicate

555
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,200
without having to say everything out loud.

556
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Because I doubt they’ll talk openly.

557
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
Okay.

558
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,600
Then

559
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,360
I’ll teach you how.

560
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
What are you doing?

561
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
Recording

562
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Both of you stop right there.

563
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,800
When actors are doing a workshop,

564
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
they need privacy.

565
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,160
Especially for an erotic scene like this.

566
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,840
They need a safe space.

567
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,000
Not everything has to be filmed for content.

568
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,440
Yes.

569
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Today’s workshop isn’t difficult at all.

570
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,440
We just need to hold hands

571
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
and look into each other's eyes.

572
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,080
And say the first thing that comes to mind.

573
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,720
Anything?

574
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,800
Like,

575
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,560
chair?

576
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah,

577
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,280
but actually, it should also involve the other person too.

578
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,600
The more we focus on our scene partner,

579
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
the more the words will feel closer to us.

580
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,240
When you hear a keyword from the other side,

581
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,000
think about it and see which word pops up.

582
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Then just keep the conversation going naturally.

583
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,320
Does that really help?

584
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,480
Be honest with your own feelings.

585
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Try it.

586
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay.

587
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,280
Brown eyes.

588
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Black eyes.

589
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,360
Cute nose.

590
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
Pink lips.

591
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,480
Be honest with your feelings,

592
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,560
director.

593
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,320
Huh?

594
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
Director Sea.

595
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,960
Oh,

596
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
okay, okay.

597
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Talented.

598
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,680
Not sure.

599
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,360
Talented.

600
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
Thank you.

601
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,440
Beautiful.

602
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,320
I know.

603
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,840
Ex.

604
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,880
Different.

605
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,480
Afraid.

606
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,199
Honest.

607
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,600
Not sure.

608
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,920
Promise.

609
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,760
I promise I won’t make you sad

610
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,840
or overthink

611
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,880
like your ex did.

612
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,040
Thank you.

613
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,360
Okay.

614
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,080
That’s basically what this workshop is like.

615
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,520
Actually, there were some words that weren’t keywords,

616
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,120
but that’s fine.

617
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,960
Now that both of us feel

618
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,600
more confident and trust each other more,

619
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,800
try doing some body contact.

620
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,160
Say one word that you feel the most right now.

621
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
I like you.

622
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,440
I really like you.

623
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,840
I like you too.

624
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,800
Director Sea, are you wearing Jollynn’s brand too?

625
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,560
You know Jollynn?

626
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,520
Yeah, it’s comfy

627
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,800
and doesn’t have those pressing wires.

628
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,280
That’s true,

629
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,360
I like it too and can wear it all day.

630
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,600
It’s not tight at all.

631
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,440
Look.

632
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,960
Comfortable and not constricting.

633
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,880
Enhances beauty without effort.

634
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,760
You’re basically the model for the ad yourself.

635
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So, do you like it?

636
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
It’s beautiful.

637
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,200
What?

638
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,520
Didn’t you say

639
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,760
I should understand a character that’s different from me?

640
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
Kit smokes.

641
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,960
So

642
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
I want to understand him better.

643
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,440
You don’t hate it anymore?

644
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,680
I never hated it,

645
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
did you just assume that?

646
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Which thing are you talking about?

647
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,840
Everything, really.

648
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,920
Why do you look confused?

649
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Like you weren’t the one who sent it.

650
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,160
I really didn’t send it.

651
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,920
Then who the hell typed that?

652
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,840
My dad locked me up back then.

653
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,600
Huh?

654
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,360
Why’d your dad lock you up?

655
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,360
Because of me?

656
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,520
When I found out about you and Professor Mint,

657
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I was going to go see you.

658
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,160
But my dad wouldn’t let me.

659
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Dad! I was so mad I almost hit him.

660
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,400
Please don’t do this. He said I was crazy.

661
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,040
He had people lock me up and took my phone.

662
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,200
Give me my phone back!

663
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,680
Or I’ll run away from home.

664
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,640
Watch him carefully. If he doesn’t stop this nonsense,

665
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,440
lock him up and don’t let him out.

666
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,520
Since then, my dad’s been watching me all the time.

667
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,680
So I had to block your number

668
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
and couldn’t contact you again.

669
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,520
I’ve been waiting all this time

670
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
to see you again.

671
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,840
I’m really sorry

672
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,320
I wasn’t there for you.

673
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
About Professor Mint,

674
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
the porn thing,

675
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and the hospital.

676
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,440
I’m really sorry.

677
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,400
But…

678
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Back then, I really couldn’t do much.

679
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,800
I’m sorry too.

680
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,320
You never stopped believing in me.

681
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
But I was the one

682
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
who didn’t believe in you.

683
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
So

684
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,240
we’re good now, right?

685
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,880
Yeah.

686
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,160
Then teach me how to smoke.

687
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This one’s a prop cigarette.

688
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,440
Please, Mr.Tutor?

689
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Fine.

690
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,120
Start by holding it properly.

691
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,800
Like this.

692
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,720
No, not like that.

693
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,080
Oh, you little kid.

694
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,760
Come here.

695
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Inhale.

696
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,560
You little kid.

697
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,720
Oh please,

698
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,560
last night you were drunk and crying in my arms.

699
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,560
How old were you then?

700
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,840
Give it here.

701
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Let your tutor show you.

702
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,600
Exhale first.

703
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
The next lesson is through the nose.

704
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,320
Like a dragon? Yeah.

705
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,080
Try it.

706
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,680
Inhale.

707
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,680
Hey.

708
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,920
You get five points.

709
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,120
Out of a million.

710
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,200
Yeah.

711
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,000
Like this?

712
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,840
Hey.

713
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
Hello.

714
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,240
Ice.

715
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,240
Before this, I didn’t think it through.

716
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,240
I just kept pressuring you guys to nail the love scene.

717
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,560
Instead of letting you two

718
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
understand the characters first.

719
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,120
To slowly build that connection.

720
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,440
And when you’re ready,

721
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,840
then let your own instincts take over.

722
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,400
I'm sorry.

723
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,120
I’m sorry for

724
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,000
making you uncomfortable like that.

725
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I’ll try not to do it again.

726
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,840
It’s okay.

727
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Thank you so much, everyone,

728
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,960
for caring about me.

729
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,120
And I’m sorry to you too, Saint.

730
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,040
We forgot to get your consent.

731
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,400
You probably didn’t feel good

732
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,280
about being forced to do a love scene.

733
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,840
It’s alright.

734
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,280
Thank you for understanding,

735
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,120
just let me know first next time.

736
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,240
As you know, today we won’t be filming any scenes yet.

737
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,800
We’ll be doing a workshop about relationship

738
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,680
and chemistry between you two.

739
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,040
And today, I’ve invited a special acting coach.

740
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,080
Please give a big hand to

741
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,720
the daughter of TQB’s president,

742
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,280
a former famous child actress

743
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
with over ten years of experience,

744
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,160
Teacher Lanee.

745
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,280
If you’re ready,

746
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,600
open your eyes and look at each other.

747
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
When you’re ready, you can start.

748
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,840
Hair styled.

749
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,880
Hair down.

750
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,400
Sharp nose.

751
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,000
Thin lips.

752
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,640
Navy shirt.

753
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,480
Be honest with your feelings.

754
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,560
Don’t try to look for something else.

755
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,240
Just say the first thing that comes to your mind.

756
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,640
Black eyes.

757
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,720
Beautiful eyes.

758
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,640
Warm eyes.

759
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,480
Nice voice.

760
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,000
Guitar.

761
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,840
Lamp.

762
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,200
Sunflower.

763
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,040
Panda.

764
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,360
Miss you.

765
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,520
Miss you.

766
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,960
Sad.

767
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,040
Sad too.

768
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,000
Now, each of you say one sentence that expresses

769
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
what you feel most clearly right now.

770
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,600
Say it.

771
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,480
I’m sorry.

772
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,160
I forgive you.

773
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,720
Thank you, both of you, for being willing to talk.

774
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,720
And don’t forget to keep practicing

775
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,520
and go over your lines.

776
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,200
Next time, I’ll go back to rehearse scene eight again.

777
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,520
Okay.

778
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,480
Sure thing.

779
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,000
See you, Sea.

780
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,600
Yeah, get home safe.

781
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,800
Taxi?

782
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,720
Uh..

783
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,400
You can go first.

784
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,880
I need to go sing at Aor’s bar.

785
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,320
I can go with you then.

786
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,080
We can share a cab.

787
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Alright, sure.

788
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,000
Let’s go.

789
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,760
(Don’t think too much, just let me kiss you.)

790
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,960
(Don’t be afraid to love, just say...)

791
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,200
(Just say you love me.)

792
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,200
(Try thinking about it, hey.)

793
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,400
(Before I kiss you, hey.)

794
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,440
(But from what I see, you wanna kiss me too.)

795
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,800
(I wanna kiss kiss you.)

796
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,240
(I wanna love love you.)

797
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,160
(I’m gonna kiss you.)

798
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,360
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss you.)

799
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,760
(One two three four five.)

800
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,240
(Six seven eight nine ten and kiss.)

801
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,840
(If someone told you they loved you,)

802
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,880
(There’s no need to overthink it.)

803
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,880
(Ten seconds is enough. If you don’t answer.)

804
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,480
(One two three four five.)

805
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,320
(Six seven eight nine ten and kiss.)

806
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,640
Careful, slow down.

807
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,000
Saint.

808
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,160
Do you want to rehearse the scene together?

809
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,360
I kinda want to see if Sea’s workshop

810
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,760
really made us act better.

811
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,000
Which scene?

812
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,960
The one we left unfinished.

813
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,400
If you want to,

814
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,120
I’m fine with it.

815
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,320
Does Kit have to start?

816
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,840
What should Kit do?

817
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,720
Close your eyes.

818
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,360
But Kit wants to look at Seen?

819
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,240
And does Kit want to kiss Seen?

820
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,880
Yeah.

821
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,120
Can I kiss you, Seen?

822
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,040
If it’s Kit,

823
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,040
he wouldn’t ask.

824
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:08,440
(Is it still me that you love?)

825
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,840
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

826
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,000
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

827
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,440
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

828
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,400
I'll go open it,

829
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,960
you just wait here.

830
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,200
Hello my love, did you miss me?

831
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,680
Warm?

832
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,720
Hey!

833
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,720
I’ve been waiting forever for you to come out.

834
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,360
I don’t want to lose you.

835
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,120
Just tell me you like me.

836
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,480
What were you doing just now?

837
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,360
Did you forget you already have a boyfriend?

838
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,360
I think I really need to stop

839
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,960
seeing you in such a bad light.

840
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,880
Then I’ll just stay here tonight.

841
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,880
Or is there something at your condo

842
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,080
that makes you want to go back so badly?

843
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,680
Why did Ice come with Professor Mint?

844
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,560
Where are you going, Saint?

845
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
I’m heading out.

846
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,880
You can’t.

847
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,720
Mr.Khom gave strict orders.
