1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,280
Why do you both smell like alcohol?

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,480
Warm?

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,520
I just didn’t want you to know

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,000
that we were alone together.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,360
Ice!

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,160
Imagine if I didn’t have a boyfriend,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,400
how would you kiss me then?

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,000
I think I need to stop

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,520
seeing you in such a bad light.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Then I guess

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,840
I’ll keep letting my face get punched up and bruised,

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,200
just in case it helps me win your heart.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,440
This is my apology gift.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,160
You and Lanee are getting married.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,400
Me and Mrs. Jan have already planned everything.

16
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,240
Check if Saint’s been

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
messaging anyone suspicious.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
Wait? Why is Ice with Professor Mint?

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Where are you going?

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
I going out.

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
No.

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
Mr.Khom gave his orders.

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,680
There's something really important

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,000
I really need to get to.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
Is it about Ice?

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,640
The something important?

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,560
You should know.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,400
Then can you tell me

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,320
what happened to Ice?

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,520
Maybe your father would also like to know.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on in.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,280
Did you come to see me for something?

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,640
I just wanted to ask you about Acting for Film.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,200
If I want to act in a film noir,

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,680
how should I do it?

36
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,079
Can you teach me?

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,040
Of course.

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
But why not ask in class or at the university?

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Because here,

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
it’s just the two of us,

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,840
and we can truly be ourselves.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Right, professor?

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,000
Ten!

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,520
Shit.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,160
You need a keycard.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,880
What do we do?

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,240
I think there are only two ways.

48
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,400
We either steal a keycard,

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,240
or wait for someone to come in or out

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,880
and sneak in.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,680
We should wait for someone to open the door.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,120
Don’t tell me.

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,280
I think we should just steal it.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,079
I knew it, you bastard.

55
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,760
No.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
You’re going to steal her keycard?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
How could you even think of that?

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,200
Otherwise we can’t get up there.

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,079
We can’t. Excuse me, sir.

60
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,840
Let’s just..

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,040
Which room are you visiting?

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,440
I don’t know, I’m here to see a friend.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
Then please call your friend

64
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,800
to come down and get you.

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I already did, but he’s not picking up.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Then you can’t go in.

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,200
Please step aside.

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,880
Tch.

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,600
Fine.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,840
I’ll just ask the cashier.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
They call it the front desk.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,760
Right this way.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,560
Thanks.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,440
Excuse me, miss,

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
do you know which room Ice

76
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,640
went to meet Professor Mint?

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Who? Ice, my friend.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
Uh..

79
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,440
Right, which room is

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,280
Assistant Professor Dr. Pruk staying in?

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I’m sorry, but we can’t contact guests directly

82
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,080
if you don’t know their room number.

83
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,680
It’s for their privacy protection.

84
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,399
I understand,

85
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,920
but my friend might be in danger right now.

86
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,640
I need to go see him immediately.

87
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
It’s really serious.

88
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah,

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,360
what if he’s being assaulted?

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,960
We’ll have security check first,

91
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,640
but I suggest you file a police report.

92
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
And have the police come here.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
If you’re only saying this without proof,

94
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,920
we can’t let you into the building.

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
What the hell?

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,080
Really can’t, huh?

97
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
No, sir.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,280
Hello?

99
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
They’re not letting me in.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,080
What should we do?

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,000
You stay by the lobby.

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
If Professor Mint or Ice comes down,

104
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
call me right away.

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,240
Ice is in danger.

106
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,920
You didn’t know, did you, Aunt Bua?

107
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,840
That last time, when you locked me up,

108
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,640
you have no idea how awful Ice felt.

109
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,040
He tried to kill himself.

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
And you were part of the reason

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
I couldn’t save him in time.

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,440
If you try to stop me again this time,

113
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
even if I have to use force, I’ll do it.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
I’ll do it.

115
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Everyone, come to me on the second floor.

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,600
Now.

117
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,120
Please go back to your room, Saint.

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
I just missed you, professor.

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
Oh?

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
I thought...

121
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,080
you didn’t want to see me anymore.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why wouldn’t I?

123
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,520
Because...

124
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,720
I’m not the only one you have now.

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
Just the other day

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,480
I saw you and Alex together.

127
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,840
I could barely stand it, professor.

128
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Hey...

129
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
what kind of person do you think I am?

130
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Huh?

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,600
I told you I don’t like you,

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
and I don’t like Alex either.

133
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Are you still trying to flirt with me?

134
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,680
But professor,

135
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
it’s just the two of us here.

136
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,640
You don’t need to lie to yourself.

137
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,320
Please.

138
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
Listen.

139
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
Just because you’re good-looking

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,320
doesn’t mean everyone who likes you

141
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,360
wants to sleep with you.

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Huh?

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,600
Ice.

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I have a wife.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,520
And my child died because of you.

146
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Wasn't it because of you?

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Why are you talking like I’m the villain here?

148
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
Then why did you follow me?

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,520
To ruin my family again and again?

150
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,159
Just because I didn’t want to sleep with you?

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
I gave you the chance to start a new life!

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,640
What new life?!

153
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,640
My life’s ruined because of scum like you.

154
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,080
Did you forget

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,440
what you did to me?

156
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,200
Hey!

157
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you high?

158
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
Get a hold of yourself!

159
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
Go home!!

160
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,600
Hello?

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,760
Please come to my room.

162
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
Someone’s trying to assault me.

163
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,400
Ouch!

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,160
Get out!

165
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,480
What’s going on?

166
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
I heard you talking to Saint earlier.

167
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,120
You were being loud.

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,960
Oh…

169
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
We were just talking about him going out.

170
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
But he changed his mind.

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,200
He’s practicing his script in the room.

172
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,520
Where was he going?

173
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
To see a friend.

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Then I’ll go check on him.

175
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
Um, sir...

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sir?

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Saint,

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
are you asleep?

179
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
Uh…

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,240
I’m practicing lines,

181
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
dad. Is there something wrong?

182
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,560
I want to talk about today.

183
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Can I come in?

184
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,560
Uh…

185
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,440
Can we talk tomorrow?

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,000
I’m really tired today.

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,120
Sir?

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Maybe tomorrow?

189
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Let him have a little time to himself.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Hmm.

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,920
Alright then.

192
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
We’ll talk tomorrow morning.

193
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

194
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,600
Good night dad.

195
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
Good night.

196
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
Thank you.

197
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
How many lives have you ruined?

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Just wait!!

199
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
I’m the one who’s going to expose you

200
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,560
and that disgusting slaughter room too!

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,640
I’ll ruin your entire life!

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
Expose me for what?

203
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,120
You came into my room.

204
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
You flirted with me, wanted me to sleep with you.

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,640
When I refused, you attacked me.

206
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
And this isn’t even the first time.

207
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,520
It’s the third!

208
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Think about who’s really going to lose their future.

209
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Excuse me.

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,000
The front desk told me to come check.

211
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you need any help, sir?

212
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Help me.

213
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,240
Please call the police.

214
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Help me!

215
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Help me!

216
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Sir.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
It’s fine, everything’s okay.

218
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,640
Thank you.

219
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Sorry for disturbing your rest.

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,360
Zoom.

221
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
I could teach you, you know.

222
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,600
About acting or about camera work.

223
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,360
But you and I, we’re built different.

224
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,680
Zoom.

225
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,800
Why the hell did you help him?

226
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,240
Didn’t you say

227
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
you wanted to start a new life?

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,720
You’re graduating in a few months,

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
you’ll finally be free.

230
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
So choose...

231
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
how you want your life to end.

232
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,240
I want to start a new life.

233
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,880
Good.

234
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Every other student who’s slept with me.

235
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,880
Whether for grades or whatever reason.

236
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,960
If you...

237
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,080
interfere with my life even once more,

238
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,920
the videos and photos of you with me

239
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
will be leaked instantly.

240
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,000
If you want his life to end up like yours.

241
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
Fine.

242
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
But remember, it’ll be because of you.

243
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,560
Okay.

244
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,040
That’s it for today’s Film Noir class.

245
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Let’s go.

246
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,840
When’s he coming?

247
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,080
I want to know that too.

248
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,440
Hey.

249
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,560
Ice’s here, Mud.

250
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,840
Ice,

251
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
what were you doing just now?

252
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Why did you meet Professor Mint alone?

253
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,840
Did he do something to you?

254
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
I’m fine.

255
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
Didn’t I tell you before?

256
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
If something happens, tell me?

257
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,280
Why do you always act like you’re on your own?

258
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,600
Mud.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,760
Calm down, man.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,800
Just calm down.

261
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,320
Wait.

262
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
You okay?

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,480
You don’t look okay at all.

264
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,320
Want us to take you home?

265
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Ice!

266
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,960
Are you hurt anywhere?

267
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,080
(Is it still me that you love?)

268
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,760
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

269
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Can you take me somewhere?

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Anywhere.

271
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
I want to go somewhere quiet.

272
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Where it's only me and you.

273
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,160
(can it still be me that you love?)

274
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,480
(I still hold on to every promise,)

275
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,520
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

276
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,000
(Change these cold nights)

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,040
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

278
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,440
(That's all I want to ask.)

279
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,160
(Private Property: No Trespassing)

280
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,000
We're here.

281
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,400
Where the hell did you bring me?

282
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
Chanthaburi province.

283
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,720
You're bringing me to someone else's property,

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,280
aren't they going to shoot us?

285
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
The owner is kind,

286
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,720
they won't shoot.

287
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,960
Talking about heavy stuff,

288
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,400
shouldn’t we go to a pretty location?

289
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Even if the topic’s not fun,

290
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,920
if it’s cinematic,

291
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
it might be a scene people remember.

292
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
Where did you learn that?

293
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,840
I want to be a cameraman.

294
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,360
Don’t I need to know a few things then?

295
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,200
Ice?

296
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,280
Can I ask you something?

297
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
You went to see Prof.Mint alone

298
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,840
because you didn’t want to drag us into this, right?

299
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,960
When will you realize

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,760
how important you are to me?

301
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,440
And there’s Sea

302
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,960
and the other friends too.

303
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,640
I’m used to handling this kind of stuff alone.

304
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
Then get used to having me in your life.

305
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Let’s find a solution together.

306
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,120
But…

307
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,840
Don’t put yourself at risk alone again.

308
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
Okay?

309
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,000
Promise.

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Sure.

311
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
No matter what,

312
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I want you to know

313
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
that I’ll always be by your side.

314
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,600
As a friend or whatever.

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,080
Come on.

316
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
What are you doing?

317
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,280
Well…

318
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
If we came to the lake,

319
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,640
we should at least dip our feet in, right?

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,480
No way.

321
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,920
I only have one pair of underwear.

322
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,440
You can buy underwear around here.

323
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Come on.

324
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Come on.

325
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,760
Hurry, get in.

326
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,920
The water is freezing.

327
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah!

328
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Buy me new underwear too!

329
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:00,880
Hey, come on.

330
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,600
Quickly!

331
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,480
No, don’t!

332
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,360
What are you guys doing here?!

333
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
Hey.!

334
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
How did everyone end up here?

335
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,400
Saint posted a close-friends post

336
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,720
and captioned it..

337
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,640
Two people

338
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,800
this spot, right here.

339
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,360
It's here.

340
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,080
Good thing

341
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,440
Book and I came to Saint’s private lake before,

342
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,840
otherwise how would we find it?

343
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,200
This is more than a sasaeng tour.

344
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,360
This is your private lake?

345
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,200
Yeah.

346
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,280
Hmm.

347
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
You came without telling your friends.

348
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Leaving me and Lanee to deal with your dad.

349
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,720
He grilled us, asking where did you and your car go?

350
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,040
Don’t glare at him so hard.

351
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,520
Only Lanee and I are in the close-friends list.

352
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,440
What?

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,480
Why don’t I have you on my close-friends list?

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,280
You still asking?

355
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
You can’t keep a secret.

356
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,480
You’re the same. Huh?

357
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey.

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,280
You missed!

359
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,880
Hey! Ah!

360
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,160
You missed! Hey! What's that?

361
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,280
Did you think I’d fall into a trap..

362
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
My ears are ringing!

363
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,120
Actually Lanee and I were only coming.

364
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,000
But when I was about to come out,

365
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
Mud followed.

366
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I wasn't following you.

367
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
I just came to check if Ice was really okay.

368
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,560
Same here.

369
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,720
I’m okay now.

370
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,360
Good.

371
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Next time don’t do that alone, Ice.

372
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,240
If anything happens tell us.

373
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,960
We’re always ready to help.

374
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,920
Thanks.

375
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,400
Since everyone’s in Chanthaburi anyway,

376
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
and today is my birthday,

377
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,000
shall we throw a beach party?

378
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
Yes!

379
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,160
Then let’s set it up now.

380
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Book.

381
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Help me organize the party.

382
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Sure.

383
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,320
Ice, can you sing at the birthday party?

384
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,600
Sure.

385
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,160
Party! Party!

386
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,680
Hey Book, I’m coming with you, okay?

387
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,640
I’m single now.

388
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,280
I’m ready to be your best friend again.

389
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Oh really?

390
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,600
Sorry bro,

391
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,760
I’m not single…

392
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,600
Friend.

393
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,040
Alright, shall we head to the sea

394
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
before it gets too late?

395
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,920
Let’s go.

396
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,640
Me and Ice will go buy a gift for you first.

397
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,160
Do you want to go?

398
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,720
How will it be a surprise?

399
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
If you take her with you to buy it?

400
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
Go ahead.

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Ok.

402
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,000
See ya.

403
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,760
I’m going to the beach now.

404
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,040
I want to go to the sea.

405
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,240
Mud, go.

406
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Why are you just standing there?

407
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,960
Hey.

408
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,760
So, what’s Lanee like?

409
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
She’s lovely,

410
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
optimistic,

411
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,480
compassionate, crybaby-ish,

412
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,680
and very strong

413
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,480
Why do you ask?

414
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,240
No reason.

415
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,040
Just to know what suits her.

416
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,160
And suits what?

417
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Maybe someone like you.

418
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Hey, Ice.

419
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,760
Anyway,

420
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,400
I don’t want to know about you and your girlfriend.

421
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,800
I already have enough to worry about.

422
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,560
But you two do make a good match.

423
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,760
Family, status, and personality.

424
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Then shall we get that mermaid cake?

425
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I saw Lanee likes mermaids.

426
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,280
Good.

427
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
Excuse me.

428
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,920
Please get that mermaid cake.

429
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,960
Okay.

430
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,640
Thank you.

431
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,520
How did you know she likes mermaids?

432
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,320
Her wallpapers,

433
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,360
keychains, and things like that.

434
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,440
Wow.

435
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
Paying that much attention to other people

436
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,400
That other person is your girlfriend, you know.

437
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,360
Ice.

438
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,800
Me and Lanee..

439
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,240
What are you doing?

440
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,040
Why did you come out here together?

441
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,160
Didn’t you think to invite your own boyfriend?

442
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,320
Huh?

443
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,520
I came for Lanee and Saint’s birthday party.

444
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,440
The party is today.

445
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
I saw it on the GPS.

446
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,640
You’ve been here since last night, weren’t you?

447
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,960
Huh?

448
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,040
Don’t you know what happened to Ice last night?

449
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,240
What happened?

450
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,280
It’s not important.

451
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,480
I was busy with making music last night.

452
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,520
Hey Ice.

453
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,320
I have something to show you.

454
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,480
Have you checked social media yet?

455
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,440
Open it.

456
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
Quick.

457
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,880
Can you see that I finally did it?

458
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,080
I told you it takes time.

459
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,880
But sorry I couldn’t talk with you earlier.

460
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
I fixed the problem now.

461
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,160
People are praising you,

462
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,960
saying you’re handsome and talented.

463
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,840
Yeah.

464
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,920
You said you had something to clear up with me.

465
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
What was it about?

466
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,080
Oh...

467
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,520
This place isn’t very private, huh?

468
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,720
It’s fine.

469
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
We can talk later, just the two of us.

470
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,280
For now, let’s eat first.

471
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,920
This meal’s on me.

472
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,160
I even ordered your favorite,

473
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,080
grilled pork neck salad.

474
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,320
Come on, eat up.

475
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Everything’s so spicy though.

476
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,160
Can you handle it?

477
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,120
Should I order something else?

478
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,680
If you can’t eat spicy, don’t force yourself.

479
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,000
Then maybe just let me

480
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,200
and Ice eat together, the two of us.

481
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
You can go find something else to eat.

482
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,600
I can handle spicy food.

483
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,160
If it means I get to eat with him,

484
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,440
it’s better than letting him eat alone

485
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,080
while you go find something else.

486
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,400
What do you mean by that?

487
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,080
Are you sure you want me to say it?

488
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,760
Miss Lanee's cake is ready now.

489
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,840
Please pick it up at the counter.

490
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,800
Warm.

491
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
I think you should go back first.

492
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,160
I’ll call you once I’m back in Bangkok.

493
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,160
Come on, Saint.

494
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,320
The cake’s ready, let’s go.

495
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Wait.

496
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
Lanee.

497
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
The daughter of the TQB owner,

498
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,760
Saint’s girlfriend, right?

499
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,440
Where is she?

500
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Wherever she is, it’s none of your business.

501
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,560
Ice,

502
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,400
if I say I want to stay here a bit longer,

503
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,680
you wouldn’t mind, would you?

504
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,200
Up to you.

505
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,040
Wherever you go,

506
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,120
it’s never had anything to do with me anyway.

507
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,480
Once I’m back in Bangkok,

508
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
I’ll come see you, okay?

509
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,200
Come on, Saint.

510
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,680
Let’s go.

511
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,520
Happy birthday, Lanee.

512
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,600
Thank you.

513
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,080
Take a picture for us?

514
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
Wow, it’s been so long! I missed you!

515
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,480
I missed you too!

516
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,320
You’ve gotten prettier.

517
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Oh.

518
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,080
I'm gonna go flirt for a bit.

519
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,520
Sure, sure.

520
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,360
Wow, your friends are something else, Lanee.

521
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,600
Man, I wish I were at least a quarter as rich as Lanee.

522
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
Birthday party by the beach,

523
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,080
inviting almost everyone in the university

524
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,360
and even arranging transport for them!

525
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,280
Damn.

526
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,800
So jealous.

527
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,400
Hey,

528
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
what’s up with you lately?

529
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,040
You’re acting all weird.

530
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,920
Nothing’s wrong with me.

531
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,480
Weird.

532
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,200
Saint.

533
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Happy birthday, Lanee.

534
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,000
Thank you.

535
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
Let’s just chill today.

536
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,800
Eat whatever you want.

537
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,840
Sure.

538
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,920
How have you been?

539
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,160
Hmm.

540
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,520
Hey guys.

541
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
This is Prite.

542
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,200
He studies economics.

543
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,240
Hi.

544
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,160
Your name’s Mud, right?

545
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,640
Ice.

546
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,360
Book talks about you a lot.

547
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,280
Play it for me.

548
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

549
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,520
Hey Mud,

550
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,160
Prite’s still talking to you.

551
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,480
I think I haven’t tuned this properly yet.

552
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,880
I don’t think I can play it right now.

553
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,960
Prite, let’s go sit over there.

554
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,320
Ice.

555
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,560
Hi, Pas.

556
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,880
Oh, Hello Pas.

557
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,680
Are you two performing for Lanee's birthday?

558
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,520
Yeah. Hmm.

559
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,520
Do you want to come join us?

560
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,000
Nah, I think tonight

561
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,880
you should be the main star.

562
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,160
But if you need help with anything, just tell me.

563
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,640
So, did you tell him yet

564
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,480
that we’re not actually together,

565
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,440
that your dad just forced you?

566
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I’m still looking for the right time.

567
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
The sound... Hmm.

568
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,160
Better hurry before

569
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,120
someone else finds the right time first.

570
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,440
Yes, coach.

571
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
And what about you?

572
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,040
Have you asked that person over there yet?

573
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,600
I asked in a general and broad way.

574
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,440
Posted an open invite to everyone in the faculty.

575
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,960
Didn’t message directly.

576
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,320
Careful, she might not get the hint.

577
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,600
Yes, coach.

578
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
This should be about right, right?

579
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,200
I’ll go refill this.

580
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
Be right back.

581
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Thanks.

582
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,239
The next song, I’d like to dedicate to Lanee.

583
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,840
Wishing you lots of happiness.

584
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,480
Happy birthday to you,

585
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,360
Happy birthday to you,

586
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,200
Happy birthday, happy birthday,

587
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,760
Happy birthday to you!

588
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
And now, let’s have the groom,

589
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,800
oops!

590
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,520
I mean, the host, make a wish!

591
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,840
I wish you lots of happiness

592
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,200
and good health.

593
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,080
May all your wishes in love come true.

594
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,800
Whoever you like or love, I hope it works out.

595
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,080
Thank you.

596
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Woohoo!

597
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:58,360
Kiss! Kiss!

598
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,240
So cute!

599
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
I’ll send it to you later.

600
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Birthday girl, what song would you like to hear?

601
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,360
All I Can Do Is Dream, please.

602
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
You got it.

603
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
(Wake up in the same old room again.)

604
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
(Stuck in this place, )

605
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,880
(about to make the same mistakes all over again.)

606
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,680
(Wake up to find that reality is...)

607
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,240
(I can only see you in dreams, )

608
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,920
(because the clock hands between us )

609
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,000
(move in opposite directions.)

610
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,040
(Hoooo...)

611
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,960
(No matter how hard I try,)

612
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,480
Lanee, let’s go take some photos.

613
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,280
Oh, sure!

614
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,040
(I know it’s impossible.)

615
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,360
(Our love doesn’t exist, does it?)

616
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,160
(At least I can dream a good dream )

617
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,920
(with you by my side.)

618
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,840
(Every happy moment only happens)

619
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,680
( when I close my eyes.)

620
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,280
(If all I get is a sweet dream,)

621
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,640
(that’s still enough because you’re here with me.)

622
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,600
(Just one more minute before we fade away.)

623
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,360
Where’s Saint?

624
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,360
Earlier, when we were supposed to pair up for rooms,

625
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,240
I stood at the lobby for half an hour,

626
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,320
but you never showed up.

627
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,560
I called you, and you didn’t pick up.

628
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,720
What the hell were you doing?

629
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,640
I told you to wait!

630
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
I was finding a room for Prite first.

631
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,000
Didn’t you hear me?

632
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,200
I’m going to sleep with Ten, screw this!

633
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,960
Done.

634
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,080
I used to wait for you every time,

635
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,480
but now you can’t wait for me just once?

636
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,560
What’s wrong with you?

637
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,160
What's going on?

638
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,200
Did you two fight or something?

639
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Hey, do you have a boyfriend yet?

640
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I like you, okay?

641
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Okay.

642
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,960
Everyone, keep having fun!

643
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,120
Let’s hand things over to

644
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,720
DJ Ten!

645
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,360
Woohoo!

646
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,200
Alright everyone!

647
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,160
If you’re not drunk yet, make some noise!

648
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,600
Woohoo!

649
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,840
Are you ready to party with DJ Ten’s house music?!

650
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
You’re really good, you know.

651
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,960
But why didn’t you sing the song you wrote?

652
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,600
I think it’s a good one.

653
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh, come on.

654
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,000
I’d be too embarrassed.

655
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,640
Singing in front of strangers? I’d die.

656
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,120
You won’t die.

657
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
I’ll sing it with you.

658
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,080
Oh, and I’ll tell you a secret.

659
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,520
There’s going to be a big songwriting competition

660
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,560
that's going include a bunch of universities.

661
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,000
You should be prepared.

662
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,760
Jymes Alan might even be the judge.

663
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,240
Really?!

664
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,200
Yeah. Wow!

665
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,680
I really like him!

666
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,120
If you do well,

667
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,720
I think it'll be in the bag for you.

668
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,920
Seriously? Yeah.

669
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Want a drink?

670
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,720
It’s really good.

671
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,280
What?

672
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
Oh, it’s finished already.

673
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,040
No worries.

674
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,880
Ice, I’ll take you to get another glass.

675
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,120
Hey, Pas.

676
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Don’t you know Ice already has a boyfriend?

677
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,440
Saint,

678
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,480
what’s your problem?

679
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,240
Did I do something to piss you off?

680
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
I’m sorry.

681
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,840
He’s drunk.

682
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,480
He’s not usually like this.

683
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,240
Please don’t take it personally.

684
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,200
Come on, Saint.

685
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,560
I was talking to Pas.

686
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Why’d you have to bring up my boyfriend?

687
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,320
Oh...

688
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,360
you wanted him to think you don’t have one, huh?

689
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Fine…

690
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,760
Sorry.

691
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,480
Won’t happen again.

692
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Forget it.

693
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You’re drunk.

694
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
So you’ve forgiven me, right?

695
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,560
Ugh!

696
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,960
Excuse me, can you please drive a bit faster?

697
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,000
It’s already dark.

698
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,760
Driving faster would be dangerous, ma’am.

699
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,440
We’re almost there.

700
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,640
Less than half an hour.

701
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,720
Alright!

702
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,440
Singles, put your hands up!

703
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,720
Woohoo!

704
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,240
Who’s single?!

705
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,320
If you’ve found the one you like,

706
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,000
don’t let them slip away!

707
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,400
Go kiss them right now!

708
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Woohoo!

709
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,560
Prite..

710
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,520
Can I kiss you?

711
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,280
Huh?!

712
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,400
What the hell?

713
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,040
This isn't fun at all!

714
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,400
Watch your step,

715
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,080
you’ll fall in the water.

716
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
Good.

717
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,600
Where’s Lanee?

718
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,000
Yeah, where did she go?

719
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,880
What are you thinking about?

720
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,440
I don’t really like stories that end sadly.

721
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Like The Little Mermaid,

722
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
she did everything for the prince,

723
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
but he never loved her back.

724
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
That hurts, you know?

725
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Maybe..

726
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,840
you’ve been waiting for the wrong prince.

727
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,880
I can tell Saint doesn’t like you.

728
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,800
You can tell?

729
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,760
Someone like him doesn’t deserve you.

730
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,520
I like you.

731
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,920
I might not be rich like Saint,

732
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,840
but I’d never let you out of my sight.

733
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,000
Please go out with me.

734
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,360
I promise I’ll never let a little mermaid like you

735
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,360
be alone again.

736
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,360
Book?

737
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,640
Have you seen Lanee?

738
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,280
No idea, man.

739
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,000
Saint? Ice?

740
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,160
Have you seen Lanee?

741
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,400
We’re looking for her too.

742
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,760
Why didn’t you take better care of your girlfriend?

743
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,600
She’s drunk!

744
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,440
If something happens, who’s gonna take responsibility?

745
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,880
I’m sorry.

746
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,400
Let’s go check outside the party.

747
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,120
I’ll look around here again.

748
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
I think I'm going to go back...

749
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,400
Wait.

750
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,880
Hold on, stay and talk to me.

751
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,720
Let go.

752
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,200
Stay still, why are you struggling?

753
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,280
Let go.

754
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,000
So… will you go out with me or not?

755
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,280
What the hell?

756
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,000
Hey, talk to me first!

757
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,080
Okay?

758
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,000
Let go.

759
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,720
Why are you fighting me?

760
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,840
I said let go!

761
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,080
Ow!

762
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,320
Will you stay still or not?

763
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,280
Let go!

764
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,040
I said let go!!

765
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,280
I said stay still!

766
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,440
What the hell are you doing to Lanee?!

767
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,520
Why are you so mad?

768
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,640
You messed with my boyfriend,

769
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,200
so I messed with yours.

770
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,600
She’s drunk!

771
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,600
How could you take advantage of her like that?!

772
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
So they’ll break up!

773
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,000
Then Saint can finally be with you.

774
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,280
Isn’t that a good thing?

775
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,440
What do you mean by that?

776
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,120
Fine!

777
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,120
Since it’s come this far.

778
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,160
I’ll just say it straight.

779
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I’m your boyfriend.

780
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,160
Has you ever cared about me?

781
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,920
All this time, everything I’ve done for you.

782
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,960
Has you ever noticed?

783
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,960
You only care about him.

784
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,640
Do you like Saint?

785
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,720
You like him a lot, huh?

786
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,360
You wants to fuck him so badly? Huh?

787
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
Well, here you go!

788
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,880
Well?

789
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,600
How does it feel?

790
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,400
To have someone wanting to sleep with your girlfriend?

791
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,640
Ow!

792
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,000
Stop blaming me already!

793
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,320
Every shitty thing you’ve ever done,

794
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,680
have you ever not blamed me for it?!

795
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,480
Have you forgotten?

796
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,200
I'm the only one

797
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,880
who accepts you for the shitty things you've done!

798
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,920
It's me!

799
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,840
I’m the only one

800
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,720
who ever could accept all the shitty things you've done!

801
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,720
But I’m done.

802
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,560
Thanks for helping me before.

803
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,560
But from now on,

804
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,000
let’s not see each other again.

805
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,120
We’re over.

806
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
Ice.

807
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Ice!

808
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,600
You homewrecking slut!

809
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,120
Stop acting like you’re some kind of hero!

810
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,000
You bastard!

811
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,080
What did you just say about my brother?!

812
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,560
Damn it!

813
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,120
Ice.

814
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,880
I'm sorry.

815
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,480
I just want to be alone right now.

816
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Saint.

817
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,920
I’ve been listening to you for days now.

818
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,560
You sing so beautifully.

819
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Thank you.

820
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,240
Happy birthday to you.

821
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,000
Happy birthday, Ice.

822
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,760
Thank you, Warm.

823
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,120
It’s the first birthday cake I’ve had in years.

824
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,360
Here.

825
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
I think you’ll need this.

826
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,120
And this too.

827
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Come, let me help you put it on.

828
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,720
Ice…

829
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,640
I think I really like you.

830
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,640
You’re good-looking,

831
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,240
good in school,

832
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,080
and you even write songs.

833
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,120
I think we should see each other more seriously.

834
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,680
Thank you so much.

835
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,520
but I’m really not ready yet.

836
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,960
You know very well

837
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,840
what I've been through.

838
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,080
Ice, everyone’s been through bad stuff.

839
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,320
It’s okay.

840
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,480
I won’t force you to do anything you don’t want.

841
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,840
But at least...

842
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,600
please give me a chance to take care of you.

843
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,080
Come stay with me.

844
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,480
(Thank you for coming into)

845
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,240
(my life as a ray of sunshine,)

846
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,200
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

847
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,560
(from once withered to bloom again.)

848
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:18,120
(Thank you for making everyday)

849
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,080
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

850
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,320
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

851
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,520
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

852
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,600
Whose boyfriend is this?

853
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,960
So talented.

854
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Warm.

855
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,640
Yeah?

856
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,040
I’m being serious.

857
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,160
Why won’t you let me join the band?

858
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,040
At least the songs I wrote.

859
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
We can sing them together.

860
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,160
Ice.

861
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,840
Trust me.

862
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,080
You’re not ready to handle the crowd yet.

863
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
Besides…

864
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,440
With what happened before,

865
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,200
it might build a wall with the crowd.

866
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,240
Do you actually like me, or just my songs?

867
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,320
I fell for you because of your songs.

868
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,840
It’s the same thing, why separate them?

869
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,280
Ice,

870
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,160
if one day I become famous,

871
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,280
I’ll tell everyone that

872
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,440
my boyfriend wrote this song for me.

873
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,800
What do you think?

874
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,400
(Saint)

875
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,800
(I look into your eyes)

876
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,480
(But you never show what’s on your mind)

877
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,160
(I’ve given you my whole heart)

878
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,640
(You just smile… and stay silent)

879
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,080
(Have you really never known?)

880
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,360
When will you realize

881
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,360
how important you are to me?

882
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,080
I’ll always be by your side

883
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
as a friend,

884
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,200
or whatever we are.

885
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,480
(I’m growing tired, ready to give up)

886
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,240
(Even though the two of us)

887
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,920
(Stand so close, just within reach)

888
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,680
(It still feels like we’re worlds apart)

889
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,080
(I keep trying to read between the lines like this)

890
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,760
(Oh, falling star, please tell me)

891
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,760
(I just want to know the heart of the one I long for)

892
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,880
(I’m ready to give you everything)

893
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,040
(If in reality, is that you love me)

894
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,560
(Wish for the star, just answer me)

895
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,120
(I pray… do you like me, even a little?)

896
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,880
(May we both find the right one)

897
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:36,760
(But please… let that someone be me)

898
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,680
This card is The Fool.

899
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,000
A liar.

900
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,800
The fortune says,

901
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,560
if you fall in love with someone,

902
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,080
that person will be hiding a secret.

903
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,480
I’ve got something to tell you.

904
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,560
I’ve been secretly in love with you.

905
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,800
Welcome to Midnight with Warm Voice.

906
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,280
I’m here to sing this song

907
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,800
and tell that person.

908
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,760
Ice, please come back to me.

909
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,400
When will you stop messing with Ice?

910
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,440
Don’t!

911
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,240
Fuck!

912
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,480
I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, Ice.
