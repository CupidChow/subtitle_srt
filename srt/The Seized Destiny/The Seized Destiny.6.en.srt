=The Seized Destiny=

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,740
(Adapted from a Tencent Animation
and Comics work)

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,220
(of the same title by Huaxiang Mogu.)

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,420
=Episode 6=

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,440
This Longqiu Chengtian,

6
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,480
who exactly is he?

7
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,679
Tell me already!

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,399
This Longqiu Chengtian

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,920
is my elder brother.

10
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,570
He's an ancient magical beast

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,679
named Sha.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,700
Where's my senior brother, then?

13
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,000
Tell me!

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,660
(Three Years Ago)

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,400
Who am I?

16
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,439
What is this place?

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,240
An ancient magical beast?

18
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,960
You're a disciple of the Longqiu Sect?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,240
My name is Longqiu Chengtian.

20
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,640
Why are you awake?

21
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,400
We should be asking you that.

22
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,760
(The seal is indeed broken.)

23
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,239
(I should fix it first.)

24
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,540
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand!

25
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,400
Dragon's Roar, Heaven's Wrath!

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,240
What is that?

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,380
He wants us to go down together.

28
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,120
However, Chengtian,

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,439
did that magical beast
do anything unforgivable?

30
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,520
Why must we have him sealed?

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Sha.

32
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,759
We made it.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,719
Is he dead?

34
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,120
Yes.

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,400
Sha.

36
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
Did you kill him?

37
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,079
He didn't kill us.

38
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,680
He was a good man.

39
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,600
You're being naive!

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
Mortal cultivators

41
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,000
are all cruel hypocrites.

42
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,990
However, having been sealed for so long,

43
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,879
I've had a cultivator's body.

44
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,519
My waiting has been worthwhile.

45
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,759
Sha.

46
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
Why did the robe turn black?

47
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,839
The Azure Dragon Robe of Longqiu
is made of dragon cotton.

48
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,990
Naturally, it turns black
when it gets tainted with demonic energy.

49
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,519
Demonic energy?

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,839
Are we different from them?

51
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,959
Of course we're different!

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,519
Due to our differences,

53
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,320
those mortal cultivators
have come after us

54
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,600
for the past thousand years.

55
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,240
I've had enough

56
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,279
of being a magical beast.

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
I want to adopt a different way of life.

58
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,240
You can have

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,120
this Azure Dragon Robe.

60
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,879
You're my only family.

61
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,399
My brother,

62
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
you must help me.

63
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,560
Sha.

64
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,879
What do you need me to do?

65
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:16,920
From now on,

66
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,959
you are the ancient magical beast,

67
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
Sha.

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,079
You shall rule the Demon Realm.

69
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,879
Sha.

70
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,839
Also,

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,399
you don't have a brother.

72
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Are you abandoning me?

73
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
You're going to stay here on my behalf.

74
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,680
Perhaps

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
this is your destiny.

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
You bet you're aware

77
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,880
of what happened after Sha's appearance.

78
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,900
It turned out that my senior brother

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,839
was gone three years ago.

80
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
It turned out that I've long lost

81
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,800
my only family.

82
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,480
Chengtian!

83
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:30,600
(Chengtian.)

84
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,720
(I am going to avenge you.)

85
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,759
The Azure Dragon Robe
has rebuilt part of the inner core.

86
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,799
After this,

87
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,919
I will locate the other two artifacts.

88
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,390
That way,
I will get a complete inner core.

89
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:00,460
(Demon God Valley)

90
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,320
Goodbye,

91
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,679
black cat.

92
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,519
(Wait.)

93
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,720
(I've been here.)

94
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,879
(Could it be I'm lost?)

95
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,080
What's this?

96
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,200
It's a living person!

97
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,120
I didn't expect another living person
to show up in the Dark Forest.

98
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,639
Get us out of here!

99
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,000
(Is this the ancient battlefield
from a thousand years ago?)

100
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,520
(These are the souls
of those who died in battle.)

101
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,519
Why can't I get into this body?

102
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,679
It... It's the Pure Yin Physique!

103
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,919
What?

104
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,360
The Pure Yin Physique?

105
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,200
Hand us your Pure Yin Physique!

106
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,240
(No way, this can't go on.)

107
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,200
Not bad.

108
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,590
(Luckily, I refined the robe,
which now gives me protection.)
