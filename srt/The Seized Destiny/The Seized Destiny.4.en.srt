5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,399
Do you feel so unhappy

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,560
after losing to Qixiu?

7
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:49,679
I know.

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,399
They asked you

9
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,600
to give up on solo cultivation.

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,240
Chengtian.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,960
Can a woman only
become a man's cultivation partner?

12
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,400
Yan,

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,512
make me a scarf.

14
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,400
You're still not good enough.

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,640
You need to train more.

16
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,159
I hope

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,200
that when I come back

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,879
from my training
at the Demon God Valley,

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,760
I can put on

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,879
the scarf you make for me.

21
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,879
Does it mean

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,320
you allow me to continue cultivating?

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,159
I'm not the one allowing it.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
This is your decision.

25
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,919
Yan,

26
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,560
remember.

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
You just need to live for your own sake.

28
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,759
If we cultivate together,

29
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,199
our spiritual energy
will increase greatly.

30
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,159
Don't move.

31
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,039
You are badly hurt.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
I detonated my inner core.

33
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,919
I can only live for three days.

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
Why did you still save me?

35
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,690
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,199
We are bonded together.

37
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,599
By the way,

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,280
if you die,

39
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,879
I'll also die.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Black Cat,

41
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,000
you saved me.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
I owe you one.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
I'll repay your kindness

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
in my next life.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,390
I don't believe in the next life.

46
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,000
I only believe in myself.

47
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,519
Chengyan.

48
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,590
You can't die easily since you colluded
with this magical beast.

49
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Let's see how you escape from this.

50
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,680
Qingping,

51
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,720
your skills in stalking
and taking advantage

52
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,480
are so much better
than your swordsmanship.

53
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,399
His Lordship said

54
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,199
he would spare you

55
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,279
if you surrendered.

56
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,360
Spare me?

57
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,959
There's no need.

58
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
You are not the one to decide.

59
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,470
I thought you've found yourself
a reliable person to support you.

60
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,720
Is that all he has?

61
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,920
I can capture

62
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,160
this annoying black cat

63
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,990
and give him to His Lordship
to harvest his soul.

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,120
Is that all from
a cultivator of the Human Realm?

65
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,160
I'll say this now.

66
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,680
No one can take Chengyan away from me.

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,879
In that case, die!

68
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,000
Chengyan!

69
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,199
Sect Leader Yun.

70
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,190
I'm afraid it's wrong
to act without permission

71
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,600
to hunt down the evil maiden.

72
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,420
I'm acting
according to His Lordship's orders

73
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,630
to persuade the evil maiden
to come back.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,079
Is that so?

75
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Do the Yun Sword Cultivators

76
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,540
need to cause such a big mess
to persuade someone?

77
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Enough nonsense!

78
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,560
Chengyan,

79
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,399
if you come back with me,

80
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,480
I guarantee

81
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,759
not to harm you.

82
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,480
Qixiu,

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,800
you are forcing me as well.

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I will never return

85
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,879
to Longqiu Palace even if it kills me!

86
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
Chengyan!

87
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,399
Chengyan!

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Ye Qixiu,

89
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,530
what is the meaning of this?

90
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,990
You came to stop me
but you forced her to jump off a cliff.

91
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
She lost her inner core.

92
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,980
She will die
if she falls down the Demon God Valley.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,320
There's the magical beast as well.

94
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,639
You actually let him go free.

95
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,910
How are you going to
explain this to His Lordship?

96
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,560
If I don't let the magical beast go,
can you defeat him?

97
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,530
Sect Leader Yun,

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,319
do you have an ulterior motive?

99
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,000
You...

100
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,279
Don't tell me

101
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,990
that you are also casting your eyes
on Chengyan's Pure Yin Physique.

102
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,160
My Lord,

103
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,639
I was going to capture the evil maiden

104
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,639
but Ye Qixiu stopped me

105
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,000
and caused her
to fall into Demon God Valley.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She has been crushed.

107
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,439
You...

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,830
What about the ancient magical beast?

109
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,720
Did he jump down as well?

110
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,480
Ye Qixiu let him go free.

111
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,240
If Sect Leader Yun
hadn't tried to kill Chengyan,

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,040
I would not be forced to take action.

113
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,800
I wanted to protect
Chengyan's Pure Yin Physique

114
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,959
but I didn't expect her
to be so determined

115
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,200
and jumped down the cliff.

116
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,040
My Lord, I'm willing to take a look
at the Demon God Valley.

117
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,519
Enough.

118
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,759
This matter is over.

119
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,320
I, Yun Qingping, am leaving.

120
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,399
My Lord,

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,159
do you feel unwell again?

122
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,710
What are you thinking about?

123
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,970
I am thinking about

124
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,879
why I am still alive.

125
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,320
Stop thinking.

126
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,080
You won't understand anyway.

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,840
Miss Cultivator

128
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
who only seeks death.

129
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you want to make a deal with me?

130
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,759
If you live on,

131
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
I will agree to a request of yours.

132
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm unlucky

133
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,919
to meet you,

134
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,759
a stubborn
and reckless female cultivator,

135
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
and even formed a bond with you.

136
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,360
Really?

137
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,360
Anything?

138
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,950
I advise you
not to request something absurd.

139
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:13,960
It's only a one-time offer.

140
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,159
I'm not going to do anything you ask.

141
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,480
Don't worry.

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,519
I am someone

143
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,759
with a bottom line.

144
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,720
I want

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
to pet a cat.

146
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,519
